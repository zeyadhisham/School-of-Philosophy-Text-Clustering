              "['Title: The Meaning of Truth\\n\\nAuthor: William James\\n\\n\\nTHE MEANING OF TRUTH\\n\\nA SEQUEL TO \\'PRAGMATISM\\'\\n\\nBy William James\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nTHE pivotal part of my book named Pragmatism is its account of the\\nrelation called \\'truth\\' which may obtain between an idea (opinion,\\nbelief, statement, or what not) and its object. \\'Truth,\\' I there say,\\n\\'is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their agreement,\\nas falsity means their disagreement, with reality. Pragmatists and\\nintellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course.\\n\\n\\'Where our ideas [do] not copy definitely their object, what does\\nagreement with that object mean? ... Pragmatism asks its usual question.\\n\"Grant an idea or belief to be true,\" it says, \"what concrete difference\\nwill its being true make in any one\\'s actual life? What experiences\\n[may] be different from those which would obtain if the belief were\\nfalse? How will the truth be realized? What, in short, is the truth\\'s\\ncash-value in experiential terms?\" The moment pragmatism asks this\\nquestion, it sees the answer: TRUE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CAN\\nASSIMILATE, VALIDATE, CORROBORATE, AND VERIFY. FALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE\\nTHAT WE CANNOT. That is the practical difference it makes to us to have\\ntrue ideas; that therefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that\\ntruth is known as.\\n\\n\\'The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth\\nHAPPENS to an idea. It BECOMES true, is MADE true by events. Its verity\\nIS in fact an event, a process, the process namely of its verifying\\nitself, its veriFICATION. Its validity is the process of its validATION.\\n[Footnote: But \\'VERIFIABILITY,\\' I add, \\'is as good as verification.\\nFor one truth-process completed, there are a million in our lives\\nthat function in [the] state of nascency. They lead us towards direct\\nverification; lead us into the surroundings of the object they envisage;\\nand then, if everything, runs on harmoniously, we are so sure that\\nverification is possible that we omit it, and are usually justified by\\nall that happens.\\']\\n\\n\\'To agree in the widest sense with a reality can only mean to be guided\\neither straight up to it or into its surroundings, or to be put into\\nsuch working touch with it as to handle either it or something connected\\nwith it better than if we disagreed. Better either intellectually or\\npractically .... Any idea that helps us to deal, whether practically or\\nintellectually, with either the reality or its belongings, that doesn\\'t\\nentangle our progress in frustrations, that FITS, in fact, and adapts\\nour life to the reality\\'s whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet\\nthe requirement. It will be true of that reality.\\n\\n\\'THE TRUE, to put it very briefly, IS ONLY THE EXPEDIENT IN THE WAY OF\\nOUR THINKING, JUST AS THE RIGHT IS ONLY THE EXPEDIENT IN THE WAY OF OUR\\nBEHAVING. Expedient in almost any fashion, and expedient in the long\\nrun and on the whole, of course; for what meets expediently all the\\nexperience in sight won\\'t necessarily meet all farther experiences\\nequally satisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways of BOILING\\nOVER, and making us correct our present formulas.\\'\\n\\nThis account of truth, following upon the similar ones given by Messrs.\\nDewey and Schiller, has occasioned the liveliest discussion. Few critics\\nhave defended it, most of them have scouted it. It seems evident that\\nthe subject is a hard one to understand, under its apparent simplicity;\\nand evident also, I think, that the definitive settlement of it will\\nmark a turning-point in the history of epistemology, and consequently\\nin that of general philosophy. In order to make my own thought more\\naccessible to those who hereafter may have to study the question, I have\\ncollected in the volume that follows all the work of my pen that bears\\ndirectly on the truth-question. My first statement was in 1884, in the\\narticle that begins the present volume. The other papers follow in the\\norder of their publication. Two or three appear now for the first time.\\n\\nOne of the accusations which I oftenest have had to meet is that of\\nmaking the truth of our religious beliefs consist in their \\'feeling\\ngood\\' to us, and in nothing else. I regret to have given some excuse for\\nthis charge, by the unguarded language in which, in the book Pragmatism,\\nI spoke of the truth of the belief of certain philosophers in the\\nabsolute. Explaining why I do not believe in the absolute myself (p.\\n78), yet finding that it may secure \\'moral holidays\\' to those who need\\nthem, and is true in so far forth (if to gain moral holidays be a\\ngood), [Footnote: Op. cit., p. 75.] I offered this as a conciliatory\\nolive-branch to my enemies. But they, as is only too common with such\\nofferings, trampled the gift under foot and turned and rent the giver. I\\nhad counted too much on their good will--oh for the rarity of\\nChristian charity under the sun! Oh for the rarity of ordinary secular\\nintelligence also! I had supposed it to be matter of common observation\\nthat, of two competing views of the universe which in all other respects\\nare equal, but of which the first denies some vital human need while\\nthe second satisfies it, the second will be favored by sane men for the\\nsimple reason that it makes the world seem more rational. To choose the\\nfirst view under such circumstances would be an ascetic act, an act of\\nphilosophic self-denial of which no normal human being would be guilty.\\nUsing the pragmatic test of the meaning of concepts, I had shown the\\nconcept of the absolute to MEAN nothing but the holiday giver, the\\nbanisher of cosmic fear. One\\'s objective deliverance, when one says\\n\\'the absolute exists,\\' amounted, on my showing, just to this, that \\'some\\njustification of a feeling of security in presence of the universe,\\'\\nexists, and that systematically to refuse to cultivate a feeling of\\nsecurity would be to do violence to a tendency in one\\'s emotional life\\nwhich might well be respected as prophetic.\\n\\nApparently my absolutist critics fail to see the workings of their own\\nminds in any such picture, so all that I can do is to apologize, and\\ntake my offering back. The absolute is true in NO way then, and least of\\nall, by the verdict of the critics, in the way which I assigned!\\n\\nMy treatment of \\'God,\\' \\'freedom,\\' and \\'design\\' was similar. Reducing,\\nby the pragmatic test, the meaning of each of these concepts to its\\npositive experienceable operation, I showed them all to mean the same\\nthing, viz., the presence of \\'promise\\' in the world. \\'God or no God?\\'\\nmeans \\'promise or no promise?\\' It seems to me that the alternative is\\nobjective enough, being a question as to whether the cosmos has one\\ncharacter or another, even though our own provisional answer be made\\non subjective grounds. Nevertheless christian and non-christian critics\\nalike accuse me of summoning people to say \\'God exists,\\' EVEN WHEN HE\\nDOESN\\'T EXIST, because forsooth in my philosophy the \\'truth\\' of the\\nsaying doesn\\'t really mean that he exists in any shape whatever, but\\nonly that to say so feels good.\\n\\nMost of the pragmatist and anti-pragmatist warfare is over what the word\\n\\'truth\\' shall be held to signify, and not over any of the facts embodied\\nin truth-situations; for both pragmatists and anti-pragmatists believe\\nin existent objects, just as they believe in our ideas of them. The\\ndifference is that when the pragmatists speak of truth, they mean\\nexclusively some thing about the ideas, namely their workableness;\\nwhereas when anti-pragmatists speak of truth they seem most often to\\nmean something about the objects. Since the pragmatist, if he agrees\\nthat an idea is \\'really\\' true, also agrees to whatever it says about\\nits object; and since most anti-pragmatists have already come round\\nto agreeing that, if the object exists, the idea that it does so is\\nworkable; there would seem so little left to fight about that I might\\nwell be asked why instead of reprinting my share in so much verbal\\nwrangling, I do not show my sense of \\'values\\' by burning it all up.\\n\\nI understand the question and I will give my answer. I am interested\\nin another doctrine in philosophy to which I give the name of radical\\nempiricism, and it seems to me that the establishment of the pragmatist\\ntheory of truth is a step of first-rate importance in making radical\\nempiricism prevail. Radical empiricism consists first of a postulate,\\nnext of a statement of fact, and finally of a generalized conclusion.\\n\\nThe postulate is that the only things that shall be debatable among\\nphilosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience.\\n[Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad libitum, but they\\nform no part of the material for philosophic debate.]\\n\\nThe statement of fact is that the relations between things, conjunctive\\nas well as disjunctive, are just as much matters of direct particular\\nexperience, neither more so nor less so, than the things themselves.\\n\\nThe generalized conclusion is that therefore the parts of experience\\nhold together from next to next by relations that are themselves parts\\nof experience. The directly apprehended universe needs, in short, no\\nextraneous trans-empirical connective support, but possesses in its own\\nright a concatenated or continuous structure.\\n\\nThe great obstacle to radical empiricism in the contemporary mind is the\\nrooted rationalist belief that experience as immediately given is all\\ndisjunction and no conjunction, and that to make one world out of this\\nseparateness, a higher unifying agency must be there. In the prevalent\\nidealism this agency is represented as the absolute all-witness which\\n\\'relates\\' things together by throwing \\'categories\\' over them like a\\nnet. The most peculiar and unique, perhaps, of all these categories is\\nsupposed to be the truth-relation, which connects parts of reality in\\npairs, making of one of them a knower, and of the other a thing known,\\nyet which is itself contentless experientially, neither describable,\\nexplicable, nor reduceable to lower terms, and denotable only by\\nuttering the name \\'truth.\\'\\n\\nThe pragmatist view, on the contrary, of the truth-relation is that it\\nhas a definite content, and that everything in it is experienceable.\\nIts whole nature can be told in positive terms. The \\'workableness\\'\\nwhich ideas must have, in order to be true, means particular workings,\\nphysical or intellectual, actual or possible, which they may set up\\nfrom next to next inside of concrete experience. Were this pragmatic\\ncontention admitted, one great point in the victory of radical\\nempiricism would also be scored, for the relation between an object and\\nthe idea that truly knows it, is held by rationalists to be nothing of\\nthis describable sort, but to stand outside of all possible temporal\\nexperience; and on the relation, so interpreted, rationalism is wonted\\nto make its last most obdurate rally.\\n\\nNow the anti-pragmatist contentions which I try to meet in this volume\\ncan be so easily used by rationalists as weapons of resistance, not only\\nto pragmatism but to radical empiricism also (for if the truth-relation\\nwere transcendent, others might be so too), that I feel strongly the\\nstrategical importance of having them definitely met and got out of\\nthe way. What our critics most persistently keep saying is that though\\nworkings go with truth, yet they do not constitute it. It is numerically\\nadditional to them, prior to them, explanatory OF them, and in no wise\\nto be explained BY them, we are incessantly told. The first point for\\nour enemies to establish, therefore, is that SOMETHING numerically\\nadditional and prior to the workings is involved in the truth of\\nan idea. Since the OBJECT is additional, and usually prior, most\\nrationalists plead IT, and boldly accuse us of denying it. This leaves\\non the bystanders the impression--since we cannot reasonably deny the\\nexistence of the object--that our account of truth breaks down, and that\\nour critics have driven us from the field. Altho in various places in\\nthis volume I try to refute the slanderous charge that we deny real\\nexistence, I will say here again, for the sake of emphasis, that the\\nexistence of the object, whenever the idea asserts it \\'truly,\\' is the\\nonly reason, in innumerable cases, why the idea does work successfully,\\nif it work at all; and that it seems an abuse of language, to say\\nthe least, to transfer the word \\'truth\\' from the idea to the object\\'s\\nexistence, when the falsehood of ideas that won\\'t work is explained by\\nthat existence as well as the truth of those that will.\\n\\nI find this abuse prevailing among my most accomplished adversaries. But\\nonce establish the proper verbal custom, let the word \\'truth\\' represent\\na property of the idea, cease to make it something mysteriously\\nconnected with the object known, and the path opens fair and wide, as\\nI believe, to the discussion of radical empiricism on its merits. The\\ntruth of an idea will then mean only its workings, or that in it which\\nby ordinary psychological laws sets up those workings; it will mean\\nneither the idea\\'s object, nor anything \\'saltatory\\' inside the idea,\\nthat terms drawn from experience cannot describe.\\n\\nOne word more, ere I end this preface. A distinction is sometimes made\\nbetween Dewey, Schiller and myself, as if I, in supposing the object\\'s\\nexistence, made a concession to popular prejudice which they, as more\\nradical pragmatists, refuse to make. As I myself understand these\\nauthors, we all three absolutely agree in admitting the transcendency of\\nthe object (provided it be an experienceable object) to the subject, in\\nthe truth-relation. Dewey in particular has insisted almost ad nauseam\\nthat the whole meaning of our cognitive states and processes lies in\\nthe way they intervene in the control and revaluation of independent\\nexistences or facts. His account of knowledge is not only absurd, but\\nmeaningless, unless independent existences be there of which our ideas\\ntake account, and for the transformation of which they work. But because\\nhe and Schiller refuse to discuss objects and relations \\'transcendent\\'\\nin the sense of being ALTOGETHER TRANS-EXPERIENTIAL, their critics\\npounce on sentences in their writings to that effect to show that they\\ndeny the existence WITHIN THE REALM OF EXPERIENCE of objects external\\nto the ideas that declare their presence there. [Footnote: It gives me\\npleasure to welcome Professor Carveth Read into the pragmatistic church,\\nso far as his epistemology goes. See his vigorous book, The Metaphysics\\nof Nature, 2d Edition, Appendix A. (London, Black, 1908.) The work What\\nis Reality? by Francis Howe Johnson (Boston, 1891), of which I make the\\nacquaintance only while correcting these proofs, contains some striking\\nanticipations of the later pragmatist view. The Psychology of Thinking,\\nby Irving E. Miller (New York, Macmillan Co., 1909), which has just\\nappeared, is one of the most convincing pragmatist document yet\\npublished, tho it does not use the word \\'pragmatism\\' at all. While I\\nam making references, I cannot refrain from inserting one to the\\nextraordinarily acute article by H. V. Knox in the Quarterly Review for\\nApril, 1909.]\\n\\nIt seems incredible that educated and apparently sincere critics should\\nso fail to catch their adversary\\'s point of view.\\n\\nWhat misleads so many of them is possibly also the fact that the\\nuniverses of discourse of Schiller, Dewey, and myself are panoramas of\\ndifferent extent, and that what the one postulates explicitly the other\\nprovisionally leaves only in a state of implication, while the reader\\nthereupon considers it to be denied. Schiller\\'s universe is the\\nsmallest, being essentially a psychological one. He starts with but one\\nsort of thing, truth-claims, but is led ultimately to the independent\\nobjective facts which they assert, inasmuch as the most successfully\\nvalidated of all claims is that such facts are there. My universe is\\nmore essentially epistemological. I start with two things, the objective\\nfacts and the claims, and indicate which claims, the facts being there,\\nwill work successfully as the latter\\'s substitutes and which will not.\\nI call the former claims true. Dewey\\'s panorama, if I understand this\\ncolleague, is the widest of the three, but I refrain from giving my own\\naccount of its complexity. Suffice it that he holds as firmly as I do to\\nobjects independent of our judgments. If I am wrong in saying this,\\nhe must correct me. I decline in this matter to be corrected at second\\nhand.\\n\\nI have not pretended in the following pages to consider all the critics\\nof my account of truth, such as Messrs. Taylor, Lovejoy, Gardiner,\\nBakewell, Creighton, Hibben, Parodi, Salter, Carus, Lalande, Mentre,\\nMcTaggart, G. E. Moore, Ladd and others, especially not Professor\\nSchinz, who has published under the title of Anti-pragmatisme an amusing\\nsociological romance. Some of these critics seem to me to labor under an\\ninability almost pathetic, to understand the thesis which they seek to\\nrefute. I imagine that most of their difficulties have been answered\\nby anticipation elsewhere in this volume, and I am sure that my readers\\nwill thank me for not adding more repetition to the fearful amount that\\nis already there.\\n\\n95 IRVING ST., CAMBRIDGE (MASS.), August, 1909.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nI THE FUNCTION OF COGNITION\\n\\nII THE TIGERS IN INDIA\\n\\nIII HUMANISM AND TRUTH\\n\\nIV THE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWER AND KNOWN\\n\\nV THE ESSENCE OF HUMANISM\\n\\nVI A WORD MORE ABOUT TRUTH\\n\\nVII PROFESSOR PRATT ON TRUTH\\n\\nVIII THE PRAGMATIST ACCOUNT OF TRUTH AND ITS MIS-UNDERSTANDERS\\n\\nIX THE MEANING OF THE WORD TRUTH\\n\\nX THE EXISTENCE OF JULIUS CAESAR\\n\\nXI THE ABSOLUTE AND THE STRENUOUS LIFE\\n\\nXII PROFESSOR HEBERT ON PRAGMATISM\\n\\nXIII ABSTRACTIONISM AND \\'RELATIVISMUS\\'\\n\\nXIV TWO ENGLISH CRITICS\\n\\nXV A DIALOGUE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MEANING OF TRUTH\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nTHE FUNCTION OF COGNITION [Footnote: Read before the Aristotelian\\nSociety, December 1, 1884, and first published in Mind, vol. x\\n(1885).--This, and the following articles have received a very slight\\nverbal revision, consisting mostly in the omission of redundancy.]\\n\\nThe following inquiry is (to use a distinction familiar to readers of\\nMr. Shadworth Hodgson) not an inquiry into the \\'how it comes,\\' but\\ninto the \\'what it is\\' of cognition. What we call acts of cognition are\\nevidently realized through what we call brains and their events, whether\\nthere be \\'souls\\' dynamically connected with the brains or not. But with\\nneither brains nor souls has this essay any business to transact. In it\\nwe shall simply assume that cognition IS produced, somehow, and limit\\nourselves to asking what elements it contains, what factors it implies.\\n\\nCognition is a function of consciousness. The first factor it implies\\nis therefore a state of consciousness wherein the cognition shall take\\nplace. Having elsewhere used the word \\'feeling\\' to designate generically\\nall states of consciousness considered subjectively, or without respect\\nto their possible function, I shall then say that, whatever elements an\\nact of cognition may imply besides, it at least implies the existence\\nof a FEELING. [If the reader share the current antipathy to the word\\n\\'feeling,\\' he may substitute for it, wherever I use it, the word \\'idea,\\'\\ntaken in the old broad Lockian sense, or he may use the clumsy phrase\\n\\'state of consciousness,\\' or finally he may say \\'thought\\' instead.]\\n\\nNow it is to be observed that the common consent of mankind has agreed\\nthat some feelings are cognitive and some are simple facts having a\\nsubjective, or, what one might almost call a physical, existence, but\\nno such self-transcendent function as would be implied in their being\\npieces of knowledge. Our task is again limited here. We are not to ask,\\n\\'How is self-transcendence possible?\\' We are only to ask, \\'How comes it\\nthat common sense has assigned a number of cases in which it is assumed\\nnot only to be possible but actual? And what are the marks used by\\ncommon sense to distinguish those cases from the rest?\\' In short, our\\ninquiry is a chapter in descriptive psychology,--hardly anything more.\\n\\nCondillac embarked on a quest similar to this by his famous hypothesis\\nof a statue to which various feelings were successively imparted. Its\\nfirst feeling was supposed to be one of fragrance. But to avoid all\\npossible complication with the question of genesis, let us not attribute\\neven to a statue the possession of our imaginary feeling. Let us rather\\nsuppose it attached to no matter, nor localized at any point in space,\\nbut left swinging IN VACUO, as it were, by the direct creative FIAT of a\\ngod. And let us also, to escape entanglement with difficulties about the\\nphysical or psychical nature of its \\'object\\' not call it a feeling\\nof fragrance or of any other determinate sort, but limit ourselves\\nto assuming that it is a feeling of Q. What is true of it under this\\nabstract name will be no less true of it in any more particular shape\\n(such as fragrance, pain, hardness) which the reader may suppose.\\n\\nNow, if this feeling of Q be the only creation of the god, it will of\\ncourse form the entire universe. And if, to escape the cavils of that\\nlarge class of persons who believe that SEMPER IDEM SENTIRE AC NON\\nSENTIRE are the same, [Footnote:1 \\'The Relativity of Knowledge,\\' held\\nin this sense, is, it may be observed in passing, one of the oddest of\\nphilosophic superstitions. Whatever facts may be cited in its favor are\\ndue to the properties of nerve-tissue, which may be exhausted by\\ntoo prolonged an excitement. Patients with neuralgias that last\\nunremittingly for days can, however, assure us that the limits of this\\nnerve-law are pretty widely drawn. But if we physically could get a\\nfeeling that should last eternally unchanged, what atom of logical or\\npsychological argument is there to prove that it would not be felt as\\nlong as it lasted, and felt for just what it is, all that time? The\\nreason for the opposite prejudice seems to be our reluctance to think\\nthat so stupid a thing as such a feeling would necessarily be, should\\nbe allowed to fill eternity with its presence. An interminable\\nacquaintance, leading to no knowledge-about,--such would be its\\ncondition.] we allow the feeling to be of as short a duration as they\\nlike, that universe will only need to last an infinitesimal part of a\\nsecond. The feeling in question will thus be reduced to its fighting\\nweight, and all that befalls it in the way of a cognitive function\\nmust be held to befall in the brief instant of its quickly snuffed-out\\nlife,--a life, it will also be noticed, that has no other moment of\\nconsciousness either preceding or following it.\\n\\nWell now, can our little feeling, thus left alone in the universe,--for\\nthe god and we psychological critics may be supposed left out of\\nthe account,--can the feeling, I say, be said to have any sort of a\\ncognitive function? For it to KNOW, there must be something to be known.\\nWhat is there, on the present supposition? One may reply, \\'the feeling\\'s\\ncontent q.\\' But does it not seem more proper to call this the feeling\\'s\\nQUALITY than its content? Does not the word \\'content\\' suggest that the\\nfeeling has already dirempted itself as an act from its content as\\nan object? And would it be quite safe to assume so promptly that the\\nquality q of a feeling is one and the same thing with a feeling of the\\nquality q? The quality q, so far, is an entirely subjective fact which\\nthe feeling carries so to speak endogenously, or in its pocket. If\\nany one pleases to dignify so simple a fact as this by the name of\\nknowledge, of course nothing can prevent him. But let us keep closer\\nto the path of common usage, and reserve the name knowledge for the\\ncognition of \\'realities,\\' meaning by realities things that exist\\nindependently of the feeling through which their cognition occurs. If\\nthe content of the feeling occur nowhere in the universe outside of the\\nfeeling itself, and perish with the feeling, common usage refuses\\nto call it a reality, and brands it as a subjective feature of the\\nfeeling\\'s constitution, or at the most as the feeling\\'s DREAM.\\n\\nFor the feeling to be cognitive in the specific sense, then, it must be\\nself-transcendent; and we must prevail upon the god to CREATE A REALITY\\nOUTSIDE OF IT to correspond to its intrinsic quality Q. Thus only can\\nit be redeemed from the condition of being a solipsism. If now the new\\ncreated reality RESEMBLE the feeling\\'s quality Q I say that the feeling\\nmay be held by us TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT REALITY.\\n\\nThis first instalment of my thesis is sure to be attacked. But one\\nword before defending it \\'Reality\\' has become our warrant for calling\\na feeling cognitive; but what becomes our warrant for calling anything\\nreality? The only reply is--the faith of the present critic or inquirer.\\nAt every moment of his life he finds himself subject to a belief in SOME\\nrealities, even though his realities of this year should prove to be his\\nillusions of the next. Whenever he finds that the feeling he is studying\\ncontemplates what he himself regards as a reality, he must of course\\nadmit the feeling itself to be truly cognitive. We are ourselves the\\ncritics here; and we shall find our burden much lightened by being\\nallowed to take reality in this relative and provisional way. Every\\nscience must make some assumptions. Erkenntnisstheoretiker are but\\nfallible mortals. When they study the function of cognition, they do\\nit by means of the same function in themselves. And knowing that the\\nfountain cannot go higher than its source, we should promptly confess\\nthat our results in this field are affected by our own liability to\\nerr. THE MOST WE CAN CLAIM IS, THAT WHAT WE SAY ABOUT COGNITION MAY BE\\nCOUNTED AS TRUE AS WHAT WE SAY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. If our hearers agree\\nwith us about what are to be held \\'realities,\\' they will perhaps also\\nagree to the reality of our doctrine of the way in which they are known.\\nWe cannot ask for more.\\n\\nOur terminology shall follow the spirit of these remarks. We will deny\\nthe function of knowledge to any feeling whose quality or content we do\\nnot ourselves believe to exist outside of that feeling as well as in\\nit. We may call such a feeling a dream if we like; we shall have to see\\nlater whether we can call it a fiction or an error.\\n\\nTo revert now to our thesis. Some persons will immediately cry out, \\'How\\nCAN a reality resemble a feeling?\\' Here we find how wise we were to name\\nthe quality of the feeling by an algebraic letter Q. We flank the whole\\ndifficulty of resemblance between an inner state and an outward reality,\\nby leaving it free to any one to postulate as the reality whatever sort\\nof thing he thinks CAN resemble a feeling,--if not an outward thing,\\nthen another feeling like the first one,--the mere feeling Q in the\\ncritic\\'s mind for example. Evading thus this objection, we turn to\\nanother which is sure to be urged.\\n\\nIt will come from those philosophers to whom \\'thought,\\' in the sense of\\na knowledge of relations, is the all in all of mental life; and who hold\\na merely feeling consciousness to be no better--one would sometimes say\\nfrom their utterances, a good deal worse--than no consciousness at all.\\nSuch phrases as these, for example, are common to-day in the mouths of\\nthose who claim to walk in the footprints of Kant and Hegel rather than\\nin the ancestral English paths: \\'A perception detached from all others,\\n\"left out of the heap we call a mind,\" being out of all relation, has no\\nqualities--is simply nothing. We can no more consider it than we can\\nsee vacancy.\\' \\'It is simply in itself fleeting, momentary, unnameable\\n(because while we name it it has become another), and for the very same\\nreason unknowable, the very negation of knowability.\\' \\'Exclude from what\\nwe have considered real all qualities constituted by relation, we find\\nthat none are left.\\'\\n\\nAltho such citations as these from the writings of Professor Green might\\nbe multiplied almost indefinitely, they would hardly repay the pains of\\ncollection, so egregiously false is the doctrine they teach. Our little\\nsupposed feeling, whatever it may be, from the cognitive point of view,\\nwhether a bit of knowledge or a dream, is certainly no psychical zero.\\nIt is a most positively and definitely qualified inner fact, with a\\ncomplexion all its own. Of course there are many mental facts which it\\nis NOT. It knows Q, if Q be a reality, with a very minimum of knowledge.\\nIt neither dates nor locates it. It neither classes nor names it. And\\nit neither knows itself as a feeling, nor contrasts itself with other\\nfeelings, nor estimates its own duration or intensity. It is, in short,\\nif there is no more of it than this, a most dumb and helpless and\\nuseless kind of thing.\\n\\nBut if we must describe it by so many negations, and if it can say\\nnothing ABOUT itself or ABOUT anything else, by what right do we deny\\nthat it is a psychical zero? And may not the \\'relationists\\' be right\\nafter all?\\n\\nIn the innocent looking word \\'about\\' lies the solution of this riddle;\\nand a simple enough solution it is when frankly looked at. A quotation\\nfrom a too seldom quoted book, the Exploratio Philosophica of John Grote\\n(London, 1865), p. 60, will form the best introduction to it.\\n\\n\\'Our knowledge,\\' writes Grote, \\'may be contemplated in either of two\\nways, or, to use other words, we may speak in a double manner of the\\n\"object\" of knowledge. That is, we may either use language thus: we\\nKNOW a thing, a man, etc.; or we may use it thus: we know such and such\\nthings ABOUT the thing, the man, etc. Language in general, following its\\ntrue logical instinct, distinguishes between these two applications\\nof the notion of knowledge, the one being yvwvai, noscere, kennen,\\nconnaitre, the other being eidevai, scire, wissen, savoir. In\\nthe origin, the former may be considered more what I have called\\nphenomenal--it is the notion of knowledge as ACQUAINTANCE or familiarity\\nwith what is known; which notion is perhaps more akin to the phenomenal\\nbodily communication, and is less purely intellectual than the other; it\\nis the kind of knowledge which we have of a thing by the presentation\\nto the senses or the representation of it in picture or type, a\\nVorstellung. The other, which is what we express in judgments or\\npropositions, what is embodied in Begriffe or concepts without any\\nnecessary imaginative representation, is in its origin the more\\nintellectual notion of knowledge. There is no reason, however, why we\\nshould not express our knowledge, whatever its kind, in either manner,\\nprovided only we do not confusedly express it, in the same proposition\\nor piece of reasoning, in both.\\'\\n\\nNow obviously if our supposed feeling of Q is (if knowledge at all) only\\nknowledge of the mere acquaintance-type, it is milking a he-goat, as\\nthe ancients would have said, to try to extract from it any deliverance\\nABOUT anything under the sun, even about itself. And it is as unjust,\\nafter our failure, to turn upon it and call it a psychical nothing, as\\nit would be, after our fruitless attack upon the billy-goat, to proclaim\\nthe non-lactiferous character of the whole goat-tribe. But the entire\\nindustry of the Hegelian school in trying to shove simple sensation out\\nof the pale of philosophic recognition is founded on this false issue.\\nIt is always the \\'speechlessness\\' of sensation, its inability to make\\nany \\'statement,\\'[Footnote: See, for example, Green\\'s Introduction to\\nHume\\'s Treatise of Human Nature, p. 36.] that is held to make the very\\nnotion of it meaningless, and to justify the student of knowledge in\\nscouting it out of existence. \\'Significance,\\' in the sense of standing\\nas the sign of other mental states, is taken to be the sole function\\nof what mental states we have; and from the perception that our little\\nprimitive sensation has as yet no significance in this literal sense,\\nit is an easy step to call it first meaningless, next senseless, then\\nvacuous, and finally to brand it as absurd and inadmissible. But in\\nthis universal liquidation, this everlasting slip, slip, slip, of direct\\nacquaintance into knowledge-ABOUT, until at last nothing is left\\nabout which the knowledge can be supposed to obtain, does not all\\n\\'significance\\' depart from the situation? And when our knowledge about\\nthings has reached its never so complicated perfection, must there\\nnot needs abide alongside of it and inextricably mixed in with it some\\nacquaintance with WHAT things all this knowledge is about?\\n\\nNow, our supposed little feeling gives a WHAT; and if other feelings\\nshould succeed which remember the first, its WHAT may stand as subject\\nor predicate of some piece of knowledge-about, of some judgment,\\nperceiving relations between it and other WHATS which the other feelings\\nmay know. The hitherto dumb Q will then receive a name and be no\\nlonger speechless. But every name, as students of logic know, has its\\n\\'denotation\\'; and the denotation always means some reality or content,\\nrelationless as extra or with its internal relations unanalyzed,\\nlike the Q which our primitive sensation is supposed to know. No\\nrelation-expressing proposition is possible except on the basis of a\\npreliminary acquaintance with such \\'facts,\\' with such contents, as this.\\nLet the Q be fragrance, let it be toothache, or let it be a more complex\\nkind of feeling, like that of the full-moon swimming in her blue abyss,\\nit must first come in that simple shape, and be held fast in that first\\nintention, before any knowledge ABOUT it can be attained. The knowledge\\nABOUT it is IT with a context added. Undo IT, and what is added cannot\\nbe CONtext. [Footnote: If A enters and B exclaims, \\'Didn\\'t you see my\\nbrother on the stairs?\\' we all hold that A may answer, \\'I saw him,\\nbut didn\\'t know he was your brother\\'; ignorance of brotherhood not\\nabolishing power to see. But those who, on account of the unrelatedness\\nof the first facts with which we become acquainted, deny them to be\\n\\'known\\' to us, ought in consistency to maintain that if A did not\\nperceive the relationship of the man on the stairs to B, it was\\nimpossible he should have noticed him at all.]\\n\\nLet us say no more then about this objection, but enlarge our thesis,\\nthus: If there be in the universe a Q other than the Q in the feeling,\\nthe latter may have acquaintance with an entity ejective to itself; an\\nacquaintance moreover, which, as mere acquaintance, it would be hard to\\nimagine susceptible either of improvement or increase, being in its way\\ncomplete; and which would oblige us (so long as we refuse not to call\\nacquaintance knowledge) to say not only that the feeling is cognitive,\\nbut that all qualities of feeling, SO LONG AS THERE IS ANYTHING OUTSIDE\\nOF THEM WHICH THEY RESEMBLE, are feelings OF qualities of existence, and\\nperceptions of outward fact.\\n\\nThe point of this vindication of the cognitive function of the first\\nfeeling lies, it will be noticed, in the discovery that q does exist\\nelsewhere than in it. In case this discovery were not made, we could\\nnot be sure the feeling was cognitive; and in case there were nothing\\noutside to be discovered, we should have to call the feeling a dream.\\nBut the feeling itself cannot make the discovery. Its own q is the only\\nq it grasps; and its own nature is not a particle altered by having\\nthe self-transcendent function of cognition either added to it or taken\\naway. The function is accidental; synthetic, not analytic; and falls\\noutside and not inside its being. [Footnote: It seems odd to call so\\nimportant a function accidental, but I do not see how we can mend the\\nmatter. Just as, if we start with the reality and ask how it may come\\nto be known, we can only reply by invoking a feeling which shall\\nRECONSTRUCT it in its own more private fashion; so, if we start with the\\nfeeling and ask how it may come to know, we can only reply by invoking\\na reality which shall RECONSTRUCT it in its own more public fashion. In\\neither case, however, the datum we start with remains just what it was.\\nOne may easily get lost in verbal mysteries about the difference\\nbetween quality of feeling and feeling of quality, between receiving\\nand reconstructing the knowledge of a reality. But at the end we must\\nconfess that the notion of real cognition involves an unmediated dualism\\nof the knower and the known. See Bowne\\'s Metaphysics, New York, 1882,\\npp. 403-412, and various passages in Lotze, e.g., Logic, Sec. 308.\\n[\\'Unmediated\\' is a bad word to have used.--1909.]]\\n\\nA feeling feels as a gun shoots. If there be nothing to be felt or\\nhit, they discharge themselves ins blaue hinein. If, however, something\\nstarts up opposite them, they no longer simply shoot or feel, they hit\\nand know.\\n\\nBut with this arises a worse objection than any yet made. We the\\ncritics look on and see a real q and a feeling of q; and because the two\\nresemble each other, we say the one knows the other. But what right have\\nwe to say this until we know that the feeling of q means to stand for or\\nrepresent just that SAME other q? Suppose, instead of one q, a number\\nof real q\\'s in the field. If the gun shoots and hits, we can easily\\nsee which one of them it hits. But how can we distinguish which one the\\nfeeling knows? It knows the one it stands for. But which one DOES\\nit stand for? It declares no intention in this respect. It merely\\nresembles; it resembles all indifferently; and resembling, per se, is\\nnot necessarily representing or standing-for at all. Eggs resemble each\\nother, but do not on that account represent, stand for, or know each\\nother. And if you say this is because neither of them is a FEELING,\\nthen imagine the world to consist of nothing but toothaches, which ARE\\nfeelings, feelings resembling each other exactly,--would they know each\\nother the better for all that?\\n\\nThe case of q being a bare quality like that of toothache-pain is quite\\ndifferent from that of its being a concrete individual thing. There is\\npractically no test for deciding whether the feeling of a bare quality\\nmeans to represent it or not. It can DO nothing to the quality beyond\\nresembling it, simply because an abstract quality is a thing to which\\nnothing can be done. Being without context or environment or principium\\nindividuationis, a quiddity with no haecceity, a platonic idea, even\\nduplicate editions of such a quality (were they possible), would be\\nindiscernible, and no sign could be given, no result altered, whether\\nthe feeling I meant to stand for this edition or for that, or whether it\\nsimply resembled the quality without meaning to stand for it at all.\\n\\nIf now we grant a genuine pluralism of editions to the quality q, by\\nassigning to each a CONTEXT which shall distinguish it from its mates,\\nwe may proceed to explain which edition of it the feeling knows, by\\nextending our principle of resemblance to the context too, and saying\\nthe feeling knows the particular q whose context it most exactly\\nduplicates. But here again the theoretic doubt recurs: duplication and\\ncoincidence, are they knowledge? The gun shows which q it points to and\\nhits, by BREAKING it. Until the feeling can show us which q it points to\\nand knows, by some equally flagrant token, why are we not free to deny\\nthat it either points to or knows any one of the REAL q\\'s at all, and to\\naffirm that the word \\'resemblance\\' exhaustively describes its relation\\nto the reality?\\n\\nWell, as a matter of fact, every actual feeling DOES show us, quite as\\nflagrantly as the gun, which q it points to; and practically in concrete\\ncases the matter is decided by an element we have hitherto left out. Let\\nus pass from abstractions to possible instances, and ask our obliging\\ndeus ex machina to frame for us a richer world. Let him send me,\\nfor example, a dream of the death of a certain man, and let him\\nsimultaneously cause the man to die. How would our practical instinct\\nspontaneously decide whether this were a case of cognition of the\\nreality, or only a sort of marvellous coincidence of a resembling\\nreality with my dream? Just such puzzling cases as this are what the\\n\\'society for psychical research\\' is busily collecting and trying to\\ninterpret in the most reasonable way.\\n\\nIf my dream were the only one of the kind I ever had in my life, if the\\ncontext of the death in the dream differed in many particulars from\\nthe real death\\'s context, and if my dream led me to no action about the\\ndeath, unquestionably we should all call it a strange coincidence,\\nand naught besides. But if the death in the dream had a long context,\\nagreeing point for point with every feature that attended the real\\ndeath; if I were constantly having such dreams, all equally perfect, and\\nif on awaking I had a habit of ACTING immediately as if they were true\\nand so getting \\'the start\\' of my more tardily instructed neighbors,--we\\nshould in all probability have to admit that I had some mysterious kind\\nof clairvoyant power, that my dreams in an inscrutable way meant just\\nthose realities they figured, and that the word \\'coincidence\\' failed\\nto touch the root of the matter. And whatever doubts any one preserved\\nwould completely vanish, if it should appear that from the midst of my\\ndream I had the power of INTERFERING with the course of the reality, and\\nmaking the events in it turn this way or that, according as I dreamed\\nthey should. Then at least it would be certain that my waking critics\\nand my dreaming self were dealing with the SAME.\\n\\nAnd thus do men invariably decide such a question. THE FALLING OF THE\\nDREAM\\'S PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES into the real world, and the EXTENT\\nof the resemblance between the two worlds are the criteria they\\ninstinctively use. [Footnote: The thoroughgoing objector might, it is\\ntrue, still return to the charge, and, granting a dream which should\\ncompletely mirror the real universe, and all the actions dreamed in\\nwhich should be instantly matched by duplicate actions in this universe,\\nstill insist that this is nothing more than harmony, and that it is as\\nfar as ever from being made clear whether the dream-world refers to that\\nother world, all of whose details it so closely copies. This objection\\nleads deep into metaphysics. I do not impugn its importance, and justice\\nobliges me to say that but for the teachings of my colleague, Dr. Josiah\\nRoyce, I should neither have grasped its full force nor made my own\\npractical and psychological point of view as clear to myself as it is.\\nOn this occasion I prefer to stick steadfastly to that point of view;\\nbut I hope that Dr. Royce\\'s more fundamental criticism of the function\\nof cognition may ere long see the light. [I referred in this note to\\nRoyce\\'s religious aspect of philosophy, then about to be published. This\\npowerful book maintained that the notion of REFERRING involved that of\\nan inclusive mind that shall own both the real q and the mental q, and\\nuse the latter expressly as a representative symbol of the former.\\nAt the time I could not refute this transcendentalist opinion. Later,\\nlargely through the influence of Professor D. S. Miller (see his essay\\n\\'The meaning of truth and error,\\' in the Philosophical Review for 1893,\\nvol. 2 p. 403) I came to see that any definitely experienceable workings\\nwould serve as intermediaries quite as well as the absolute mind\\'s\\nintentions would.]] All feeling is for the sake of action, all feeling\\nresults in action,--to-day no argument is needed to prove these truths.\\nBut by a most singular disposition of nature which we may conceive\\nto have been different, MY FEELINGS ACT UPON THE REALITIES WITHIN MY\\nCRITIC\\'S WORLD. Unless, then, my critic can prove that my feeling does\\nnot \\'point to\\' those realities which it acts upon, how can he continue\\nto doubt that he and I are alike cognizant of one and the same real\\nworld? If the action is performed in one world, that must be the world\\nthe feeling intends; if in another world, THAT is the world the feeling\\nhas in mind. If your feeling bear no fruits in my world, I call it\\nutterly detached from my world; I call it a solipsism, and call its\\nworld a dream-world. If your toothache do not prompt you to ACT as if\\nI had a toothache, nor even as if I had a separate existence; if you\\nneither say to me, \\'I know now how you must suffer!\\' nor tell me of\\na remedy, I deny that your feeling, however it may resemble mine, is\\nreally cognizant of mine. It gives no SIGN of being cognizant, and such\\na sign is absolutely necessary to my admission that it is.\\n\\nBefore I can think you to mean my world, you must affect my world;\\nbefore I can think you to mean much of it, you must affect much of it;\\nand before I can be sure you mean it AS I DO, you must affect it JUST\\nAS I SHOULD if I were in your place. Then I, your critic, will gladly\\nbelieve that we are thinking, not only of the same reality, but that we\\nare thinking it ALIKE, and thinking of much of its extent.\\n\\nWithout the practical effects of our neighbor\\'s feelings on our own\\nworld, we should never suspect the existence of our neighbor\\'s feelings\\nat all, and of course should never find ourselves playing the critic as\\nwe do in this article. The constitution of nature is very peculiar. In\\nthe world of each of us are certain objects called human bodies, which\\nmove about and act on all the other objects there, and the occasions of\\ntheir action are in the main what the occasions of our action would be,\\nwere they our bodies. They use words and gestures, which, if we used\\nthem, would have thoughts behind them,--no mere thoughts uberhaupt,\\nhowever, but strictly determinate thoughts. I think you have the notion\\nof fire in general, because I see you act towards this fire in my room\\njust as I act towards it,--poke it and present your person towards it,\\nand so forth. But that binds me to believe that if you feel \\'fire\\'\\nat all, THIS is the fire you feel. As a matter of fact, whenever we\\nconstitute ourselves into psychological critics, it is not by dint of\\ndiscovering which reality a feeling \\'resembles\\' that we find out which\\nreality it means. We become first aware of which one it means, and then\\nwe suppose that to be the one it resembles. We see each other looking\\nat the same objects, pointing to them and turning them over in various\\nways, and thereupon we hope and trust that all of our several feelings\\nresemble the reality and each other. But this is a thing of which we\\nare never theoretically sure. Still, it would practically be a case of\\ngrubelsucht, if a ruffian were assaulting and drubbing my body, to spend\\nmuch time in subtle speculation either as to whether his vision of my\\nbody resembled mine, or as to whether the body he really MEANT to insult\\nwere not some body in his mind\\'s eye, altogether other from my own. The\\npractical point of view brushes such metaphysical cobwebs away. If what\\nhe have in mind be not MY body, why call we it a body at all? His mind\\nis inferred by me as a term, to whose existence we trace the things\\nthat happen. The inference is quite void if the term, once inferred, be\\nseparated from its connection with the body that made me infer it,\\nand connected with another that is not mine at all. No matter for the\\nmetaphysical puzzle of how our two minds, the ruffian\\'s and mine, can\\nmean the same body. Men who see each other\\'s bodies sharing the same\\nspace, treading the same earth, splashing the same water, making the\\nsame air resonant, and pursuing the same game and eating out of the\\nsame dish, will never practically believe in a pluralism of solipsistic\\nworlds.\\n\\nWhere, however, the actions of one mind seem to take no effect in the\\nworld of the other, the case is different. This is what happens in\\npoetry and fiction. Every one knows Ivanhoe, for example; but so long as\\nwe stick to the story pure and simple without regard to the facts of its\\nproduction, few would hesitate to admit that there are as many different\\nIvanhoes as there are different minds cognizant of the story. [Footnote:\\nThat is, there is no REAL \\'Ivanhoe,\\' not even the one in Sir Walter\\nScott\\'s mind as he was writing the story. That one is only the FIRST\\none of the Ivanhoe-solipsisms. It is quite true we can make it the real\\nIvanhoe if we like, and then say that the other Ivanhoes know it or do\\nnot know it, according as they refer to and resemble it or no. This is\\ndone by bringing in Sir Walter Scott himself as the author of the real\\nIvanhoe, and so making a complex object of both. This object, however,\\nis not a story pure and simple. It has dynamic relations with the world\\ncommon to the experience of all the readers. Sir Walter Scott\\'s Ivanhoe\\ngot itself printed in volumes which we all can handle, and to any one of\\nwhich we can refer to see which of our versions be the true one, i.e.,\\nthe original one of Scott himself. We can see the manuscript; in short\\nwe can get back to the Ivanhoe in Scott\\'s mind by many an avenue and\\nchannel of this real world of our experience,--a thing we can by no\\nmeans do with either the Ivanhoe or the Rebecca, either the Templar or\\nthe Isaac of York, of the story taken simply as such, and detached from\\nthe conditions of its production. Everywhere, then, we have the same\\ntest: can we pass continuously from two objects in two minds to a third\\nobject which seems to be in BOTH minds, because each mind feels every\\nmodification imprinted on it by the other? If so, the first two objects\\nnamed are derivatives, to say the least, from the same third object, and\\nmay be held, if they resemble each other, to refer to one and the same\\nreality.] The fact that all these Ivanhoes RESEMBLE each other does\\nnot prove the contrary. But if an alteration invented by one man in his\\nversion were to reverberate immediately through all the other versions,\\nand produce changes therein, we should then easily agree that all\\nthese thinkers were thinking the SAME Ivanhoe, and that, fiction or no\\nfiction, it formed a little world common to them all.\\n\\nHaving reached this point, we may take up our thesis and improve it\\nagain. Still calling the reality by the name of q and letting the\\ncritic\\'s feeling vouch for it, we can say that any other feeling will\\nbe held cognizant of q, provided it both resemble q, and refer to q,\\nas shown by its either modifying q directly, or modifying some other\\nreality, p or r, which the critic knows to be continuous with q. Or more\\nshortly, thus: THE FEELING OF q KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT RESEMBLES,\\nAND EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPERATES ON. If it resemble without\\noperating, it is a dream; if it operate without resembling, it is an\\nerror. [Footnote: Among such errors are those cases in which our feeling\\noperates on a reality which it does partially resemble, and yet does not\\nintend: as for instance, when I take up your umbrella, meaning to take\\nmy own. I cannot be said here either to know your umbrella, or my own,\\nwhich latter my feeling more completely resembles. I am mistaking them\\nboth, misrepresenting their context, etc.\\n\\nWe have spoken in the text as if the critic were necessarily one mind,\\nand the feeling criticised another. But the criticised feeling and its\\ncritic may be earlier and later feelings of the same mind, and here it\\nmight seem that we could dispense with the notion of operating, to prove\\nthat critic and criticised are referring to and meaning to represent\\nthe SAME. We think we see our past feelings directly, and know what they\\nrefer to without appeal. At the worst, we can always fix the intention\\nof our present feeling and MAKE it refer to the same reality to\\nwhich any one of our past feelings may have referred. So we need no\\n\\'operating\\' here, to make sure that the feeling and its critic mean the\\nsame real q. Well, all the better if this is so! We have covered the\\nmore complex and difficult case in our text, and we may let this easier\\none go. The main thing at present is to stick to practical psychology,\\nand ignore metaphysical difficulties.\\n\\nOne more remark. Our formula contains, it will be observed, nothing to\\ncorrespond to the great principle of cognition laid down by Professor\\nFerrier in his Institutes of Metaphysic and apparently adopted by all\\nthe followers of Fichte, the principle, namely, that for knowledge to\\nbe constituted there must be knowledge of the knowing mind along with\\nwhatever else is known: not q, as we have supposed, but q PLUS MYSELF,\\nmust be the least I can know. It is certain that the common sense\\nof mankind never dreams of using any such principle when it tries to\\ndiscriminate between conscious states that are knowledge and conscious\\nstates that are not. So that Ferrier\\'s principle, if it have any\\nrelevancy at all, must have relevancy to the metaphysical possibility\\nof consciousness at large, and not to the practically recognized\\nconstitution of cognitive consciousness. We may therefore pass it by\\nwithout further notice here.] It is to be feared that the reader may\\nconsider this formula rather insignificant and obvious, and hardly worth\\nthe labor of so many pages, especially when he considers that the only\\ncases to which it applies are percepts, and that the whole field of\\nsymbolic or conceptual thinking seems to elude its grasp. Where the\\nreality is either a material thing or act, or a state of the critic\\'s\\nconsciousness, I may both mirror it in my mind and operate upon it--in\\nthe latter case indirectly, of course--as soon as I perceive it. But\\nthere are many cognitions, universally allowed to be such, which neither\\nmirror nor operate on their realities.\\n\\nIn the whole field of symbolic thought we are universally held both\\nto intend, to speak of, and to reach conclusions about--to know\\nin short--particular realities, without having in our subjective\\nconsciousness any mind-stuff that resembles them even in a remote\\ndegree. We are instructed about them by language which awakens no\\nconsciousness beyond its sound; and we know WHICH realities they are by\\nthe faintest and most fragmentary glimpse of some remote context they\\nmay have and by no direct imagination of themselves. As minds may differ\\nhere, let me speak in the first person. I am sure that my own current\\nthinking has WORDS for its almost exclusive subjective material, words\\nwhich are made intelligible by being referred to some reality that lies\\nbeyond the horizon of direct consciousness, and of which I am only aware\\nas of a terminal MORE existing in a certain direction, to which the\\nwords might lead but do not lead yet. The SUBJECT, or TOPIC, of the\\nwords is usually something towards which I mentally seem to pitch them\\nin a backward way, almost as I might jerk my thumb over my shoulder to\\npoint at something, without looking round, if I were only entirely sure\\nthat it was there. The UPSHOT, or CONCLUSION, of the words is something\\ntowards which I seem to incline my head forwards, as if giving assent to\\nits existence, tho all my mind\\'s eye catches sight of may be some tatter\\nof an image connected with it, which tatter, however, if only endued\\nwith the feeling of familiarity and reality, makes me feel that the\\nwhole to which it belongs is rational and real, and fit to be let pass.\\n\\nHere then is cognitive consciousness on a large scale, and yet what\\nit knows, it hardly resembles in the least degree. The formula last laid\\ndown for our thesis must therefore be made more complete. We may\\nnow express it thus: A PERCEPT KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT DIRECTLY OR\\nINDIRECTLY OPERATES ON AND RESEMBLES; ACONCEPTUAL FEELING, OR THOUGHT\\nKNOWS A REALITY, WHENEVER IT ACTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY TERMINATES IN A\\nPERCEPT THAT OPERATES ON, OR RESEMBLES THAT REALITY, OR IS OTHERWISE\\nCONNECTED WITH IT OR WITH ITS CONTEXT. The latter percept may be either\\nsensation or sensorial idea; and when I say the thought must TERMINATE\\nin such a percept, I mean that it must ultimately be capable of leading\\nup thereto,--by the way of practical [missing section] is an incomplete\\n\\'thought about\\' that reality, that reality is its \\'topic,\\' etc.\\nexperience, if the terminal feeling be a sensation; by the way of\\nlogical or habitual suggestion, if it be only an image in the mind.\\n\\nLet an illustration make this plainer. I open the first book I take up,\\nand read the first sentence that meets my eye: \\'Newton saw the handiwork\\nof God in the heavens as plainly as Paley in the animal kingdom.\\' I\\nimmediately look back and try to analyze the subjective state in which I\\nrapidly apprehended this sentence as I read it. In the first place there\\nwas an obvious feeling that the sentence was intelligible and rational\\nand related to the world of realities. There was also a sense of\\nagreement or harmony between \\'Newton,\\' \\'Paley,\\' and \\'God.\\' There was no\\napparent image connected with the words \\'heavens,\\' or \\'handiwork,\\' or\\n\\'God\\'; they were words merely. With \\'animal kingdom\\' I think there was\\nthe faintest consciousness (it may possibly have been an image of the\\nsteps) of the Museum of Zoology in the town of Cambridge where I write.\\nWith \\'Paley\\' there was an equally faint consciousness of a small\\ndark leather book; and with \\'Newton\\' a pretty distinct vision of the\\nright-hand lower corner of curling periwig. This is all the mind-stuff I\\ncan discover in my first consciousness of the meaning of this sentence,\\nand I am afraid that even not all of this would have been present had I\\ncome upon the sentence in a genuine reading of the book, and not picked\\nit out for an experiment. And yet my consciousness was truly cognitive.\\nThe sentence is \\'about realities\\' which my psychological critic--for we\\nmust not forget him--acknowledges to be such, even as he acknowledges\\nmy distinct feeling that they ARE realities, and my acquiescence in the\\ngeneral rightness of what I read of them, to be true knowledge on my\\npart.\\n\\nNow what justifies my critic in being as lenient as this? This\\nsingularly inadequate consciousness of mine, made up of symbols that\\nneither resemble nor affect the realities they stand for,--how can he be\\nsure it is cognizant of the very realities he has himself in mind?\\n\\nHe is sure because in countless like cases he has seen such inadequate\\nand symbolic thoughts, by developing themselves, terminate in percepts\\nthat practically modified and presumably resembled his own. By\\n\\'developing\\' themselves is meant obeying their tendencies, following up\\nthe suggestions nascently present in them, working in the direction in\\nwhich they seem to point, clearing up the penumbra, making distinct the\\nhalo, unravelling the fringe, which is part of their composition, and in\\nthe midst of which their more substantive kernel of subjective content\\nseems consciously to lie. Thus I may develop my thought in the Paley\\ndirection by procuring the brown leather volume and bringing the\\npassages about the animal kingdom before the critic\\'s eyes. I may\\nsatisfy him that the words mean for me just what they mean for him,\\nby showing him IN CONCRETO the very animals and their arrangements, of\\nwhich the pages treat. I may get Newton\\'s works and portraits; or if\\nI follow the line of suggestion of the wig, I may smother my critic in\\nseventeenth-century matters pertaining to Newton\\'s environment, to show\\nthat the word \\'Newton\\' has the same LOCUS and relations in both our\\nminds. Finally I may, by act and word, persuade him that what I mean by\\nGod and the heavens and the analogy of the handiworks, is just what he\\nmeans also.\\n\\nMy demonstration in the last resort is to his SENSES. My thought makes\\nme act on his senses much as he might himself act on them, were he\\npursuing the consequences of a perception of his own. Practically\\nthen MY thought terminates in HIS realities. He willingly supposes it,\\ntherefore, to be OF them, and inwardly to RESEMBLE what his own thought\\nwould be, were it of the same symbolic sort as mine. And the pivot and\\nfulcrum and support of his mental persuasion, is the sensible operation\\nwhich my thought leads me, or may lead, to effect--the bringing of\\nPaley\\'s book, of Newton\\'s portrait, etc., before his very eyes.\\n\\nIn the last analysis, then, we believe that we all know and think about\\nand talk about the same world, because WE BELIEVE OUR PERCEPTS ARE\\nPOSSESSED BY US IN COMMON. And we believe this because the percepts\\nof each one of us seem to be changed in consequence of changes in the\\npercepts of someone else. What I am for you is in the first instance a\\npercept of your own. Unexpectedly, however, I open and show you a book,\\nuttering certain sounds the while. These acts are also your percepts,\\nbut they so resemble acts of yours with feelings prompting them, that\\nyou cannot doubt I have the feelings too, or that the book is one\\nbook felt in both our worlds. That it is felt in the same way, that my\\nfeelings of it resemble yours, is something of which we never can be\\nsure, but which we assume as the simplest hypothesis that meets\\nthe case. As a matter of fact, we never ARE sure of it, and, as\\nERKENNTNISSTHEORETIKER, we can only say that of feelings that should NOT\\nresemble each other, both could not know the same thing at the same\\ntime in the same way. [Footnote: Though both might terminate in the same\\nthing and be incomplete thoughts \\'about\\' it.] If each holds to its own\\npercept as the reality, it is bound to say of the other percept, that,\\nthough it may INTEND that reality, and prove this by working change upon\\nit, yet, if it do not resemble it, it is all false and wrong. [Footnote:\\nThe difference between Idealism and Realism is immaterial here. What\\nis said in the text is consistent with either theory. A law by which my\\npercept shall change yours directly is no more mysterious than a law\\nby which it shall first change a physical reality, and then the reality\\nchange yours. In either case you and I seem knit into a continuous\\nworld, and not to form a pair of solipsisms.]\\n\\nIf this be so of percepts, how much more so of higher modes of thought!\\nEven in the sphere of sensation individuals are probably different\\nenough. Comparative study of the simplest conceptual elements seems to\\nshow a wider divergence still. And when it comes to general theories\\nand emotional attitudes towards life, it is indeed time to say with\\nThackeray, \\'My friend, two different universes walk about under your hat\\nand under mine.\\'\\n\\nWhat can save us at all and prevent us from flying asunder into a chaos\\nof mutually repellent solipsisms? Through what can our several minds\\ncommune? Through nothing but the mutual resemblance of those of our\\nperceptual feelings which have this power of modifying one another,\\nWHICH ARE MERE DUMB KNOWLEDGES-OF-ACQUAINTANCE, and which must also\\nresemble their realities or not know them aright at all. In such pieces\\nof knowledge-of-acquaintance all our knowledge-about must end, and\\ncarry a sense of this possible termination as part of its content.\\nThese percepts, these termini, these sensible things, these mere\\nmatters-of-acquaintance, are the only realities we ever directly know,\\nand the whole history of our thought is the history of our substitution\\nof one of them for another, and the reduction of the substitute to the\\nstatus of a conceptual sign. Contemned though they be by some thinkers,\\nthese sensations are the mother-earth, the anchorage, the stable rock,\\nthe first and last limits, the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem\\nof the mind. To find such sensational termini should be our aim with all\\nour higher thought. They end discussion; they destroy the false conceit\\nof knowledge; and without them we are all at sea with each other\\'s\\nmeaning. If two men act alike on a percept, they believe themselves to\\nfeel alike about it; if not, they may suspect they know it in differing\\nways. We can never be sure we understand each other till we are able to\\nbring the matter to this test. [Footnote: \\'There is no distinction of\\nmeaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of\\npractice.... It appears, then, that the rule for attaining the [highest]\\ngrade of clearness of apprehension is as follows: Consider what effects,\\nwhich might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object\\nof our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the\\nwhole of our conception of the object.\\' Charles S. Peirce: \\'How to make\\nour Ideas clear,\\' in Popular Science Monthly, New York, January, 1878,\\np. 293.] This is why metaphysical discussions are so much like fighting\\nwith the air; they have no practical issue of a sensational kind.\\n\\'Scientific\\' theories, on the other hand, always terminate in definite\\npercepts. You can deduce a possible sensation from your theory and,\\ntaking me into your laboratory, prove that your theory is true of my\\nworld by giving me the sensation then and there. Beautiful is the\\nflight of conceptual reason through the upper air of truth. No wonder\\nphilosophers are dazzled by it still, and no wonder they look with some\\ndisdain at the low earth of feeling from which the goddess launched\\nherself aloft. But woe to her if she return not home to its\\nacquaintance; Nirgends haften dann die unsicheren Sohlen--every crazy\\nwind will take her, and, like a fire-balloon at night, she will go out\\namong the stars.\\n\\nNOTE.--The reader will easily see how much of the account of the\\ntruth-function developed later in Pragmatism was already explicit in\\nthis earlier article, and how much came to be defined later. In this\\nearlier article we find distinctly asserted:--\\n\\n1. The reality, external to the true idea;\\n\\n2. The critic, reader, or epistemologist, with his own belief, as\\nwarrant for this reality\\'s existence;\\n\\n3. The experienceable environment, as the vehicle or medium connecting\\nknower with known, and yielding the cognitive RELATION;\\n\\n4. The notion of POINTING, through this medium, to the reality, as one\\ncondition of our being said to know it;\\n\\n5. That of RESEMBLING it, and eventually AFFECTING it, as determining\\nthe pointing to IT and not to something else.\\n\\n6. The elimination of the \\'epistemological gulf,\\' so that the whole\\ntruth-relation falls inside of the continuities of concrete experience,\\nand is constituted of particular processes, varying with every object\\nand subject, and susceptible of being described in detail.\\n\\nThe defects in this earlier account are:--\\n\\n1. The possibly undue prominence given to resembling, which altho a\\nfundamental function in knowing truly, is so often dispensed with;\\n\\n2. The undue emphasis laid upon operating on the object itself, which in\\nmany cases is indeed decisive of that being what we refer to, but which\\nis often lacking, or replaced by operations on other things related to\\nthe object.\\n\\n3. The imperfect development of the generalized notion of the\\nWORKABILITY of the feeling or idea as equivalent to that SATISFACTORY\\nADAPTATION to the particular reality, which constitutes the truth of\\nthe idea. It is this more generalized notion, as covering all such\\nspecifications as pointing, fitting, operating or resembling, that\\ndistinguishes the developed view of Dewey, Schiller, and myself.\\n\\n4. The treatment, [earlier], of percepts as the only realm of reality. I\\nnow treat concepts as a co-ordinate realm.\\n\\nThe next paper represents a somewhat broader grasp of the topic on the\\nwriter\\'s part.\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nTHE TIGERS IN INDIA [Footnote: Extracts from a presidential address\\nbefore the American Psychological Association, published in the\\nPsychological Review, vol. ii, p. 105 (1895).]\\n\\nTHERE are two ways of knowing things, knowing them immediately or\\nintuitively, and knowing them conceptually or representatively. Altho\\nsuch things as the white paper before our eyes can be known intuitively,\\nmost of the things we know, the tigers now in India, for example, or\\nthe scholastic system of philosophy, are known only representatively or\\nsymbolically.\\n\\nSuppose, to fix our ideas, that we take first a case of conceptual\\nknowledge; and let it be our knowledge of the tigers in India, as we sit\\nhere. Exactly what do we MEAN by saying that we here know the tigers?\\nWhat is the precise fact that the cognition so confidently claimed is\\nKNOWN-AS, to use Shadworth Hodgson\\'s inelegant but valuable form of\\nwords?\\n\\nMost men would answer that what we mean by knowing the tigers is having\\nthem, however absent in body, become in some way present to our thought;\\nor that our knowledge of them is known as presence of our thought to\\nthem. A great mystery is usually made of this peculiar presence in\\nabsence; and the scholastic philosophy, which is only common sense\\ngrown pedantic, would explain it as a peculiar kind of existence, called\\nINTENTIONAL EXISTENCE of the tigers in our mind. At the very least,\\npeople would say that what we mean by knowing the tigers is mentally\\nPOINTING towards them as we sit here.\\n\\nBut now what do we mean by POINTING, in such a case as this? What is the\\npointing known-as, here?\\n\\nTo this question I shall have to give a very prosaic answer--one\\nthat traverses the pre-possessions not only of common sense and\\nscholasticism, but also those of nearly all the epistemological writers\\nwhom I have ever read. The answer, made brief, is this: The pointing of\\nour thought to the tigers is known simply and solely as a procession of\\nmental associates and motor consequences that follow on the thought, and\\nthat would lead harmoniously, if followed out, into some ideal or real\\ncontext, or even into the immediate presence, of the tigers. It is known\\nas our rejection of a jaguar, if that beast were shown us as a tiger; as\\nour assent to a genuine tiger if so shown. It is known as our ability\\nto utter all sorts of propositions which don\\'t contradict other\\npropositions that are true of the real tigers. It is even known, if we\\ntake the tigers very seriously, as actions of ours which may terminate\\nin directly intuited tigers, as they would if we took a voyage to India\\nfor the purpose of tiger-hunting and brought back a lot of skins of\\nthe striped rascals which we had laid low. In all this there is no\\nself-transcendency in our mental images TAKEN BY THEMSELVES. They are\\none phenomenal fact; the tigers are another; and their pointing to the\\ntigers is a perfectly commonplace intra-experiential relation, IF YOU\\nONCE GRANT A CONNECTING WORLD TO BE THERE. In short, the ideas and the\\ntigers are in themselves as loose and separate, to use Hume\\'s language,\\nas any two things can be; and pointing means here an operation as\\nexternal and adventitious as any that nature yields.[Footnote: A\\nstone in one field may \\'fit,\\' we say, a hole in another field. But the\\nrelation of \\'fitting,\\' so long as no one carries the stone to the hole\\nand drops it in, is only one name for the fact that such an act MAY\\nhappen. Similarly with the knowing of the tigers here and now. It is\\nonly an anticipatory name for a further associative and terminative\\nprocess that MAY occur.]\\n\\nI hope you may agree with me now that in representative knowledge there\\nis no special inner mystery, but only an outer chain of physical or\\nmental intermediaries connecting thought and thing. TO KNOW AN OBJECT IS\\nHERE TO LEAD TO IT THROUGH A CONTEXT WHICH THE WORLD SUPPLIES. All this\\nwas most instructively set forth by our colleague D. S. Miller at our\\nmeeting in New York last Christmas, and for re-confirming my sometime\\nwavering opinion, I owe him this acknowledgment. [Footnote: See Dr.\\nMiller\\'s articles on Truth and Error, and on Content and Function, in\\nthe Philosophical Review, July, 1893, and Nov., 1895.]\\n\\nLet us next pass on to the case of immediate or intuitive acquaintance\\nwith an object, and let the object be the white paper before our eyes.\\nThe thought-stuff and the thing-stuff are here indistinguishably the\\nsame in nature, as we saw a moment since, and there is no context of\\nintermediaries or associates to stand between and separate the thought\\nand thing. There is no \\'presence in absence\\' here, and no \\'pointing,\\'\\nbut rather an allround embracing of the paper by the thought; and it is\\nclear that the knowing cannot now be explained exactly as it was when\\nthe tigers were its object. Dotted all through our experience are states\\nof immediate acquaintance just like this. Somewhere our belief always\\ndoes rest on ultimate data like the whiteness, smoothness, or squareness\\nof this paper. Whether such qualities be truly ultimate aspects of\\nbeing, or only provisional suppositions of ours, held-to till we get\\nbetter informed, is quite immaterial for our present inquiry. So long as\\nit is believed in, we see our object face to face. What now do we mean\\nby \\'knowing\\' such a sort of object as this? For this is also the way\\nin which we should know the tiger if our conceptual idea of him were to\\nterminate by having led us to his lair?\\n\\nThis address must not become too long, so I must give my answer in the\\nfewest words. And let me first say this: So far as the white paper or\\nother ultimate datum of our experience is considered to enter also into\\nsome one else\\'s experience, and we, in knowing it, are held to know it\\nthere as well as here; so far, again, as it is considered to be a mere\\nmask for hidden molecules that other now impossible experiences of our\\nown might some day lay bare to view; so far it is a case of tigers in\\nIndia again--the things known being absent experiences, the knowing can\\nonly consist in passing smoothly towards them through the intermediary\\ncontext that the world supplies. But if our own private vision of the\\npaper be considered in abstraction from every other event, as if it\\nconstituted by itself the universe (and it might perfectly well do so,\\nfor aught we can understand to the contrary), then the paper seen and\\nthe seeing of it are only two names for one indivisible fact which,\\nproperly named, is THE DATUM, THE PHENOMENON, OR THE EXPERIENCE. The\\npaper is in the mind and the mind is around the paper, because paper\\nand mind are only two names that are given later to the one experience,\\nwhen, taken in a larger world of which it forms a part, its connections\\nare traced in different directions. [Footnote: What is meant by this is\\nthat \\'the experience\\' can be referred to either of two great associative\\nsystems, that of the experiencer\\'s mental history, or that of the\\nexperienced facts of the world. Of both of these systems it forms part,\\nand may be regarded, indeed, as one of their points of intersection.\\nOne might let a vertical line stand for the mental history; but the\\nsame object, O, appears also in the mental history of different persons,\\nrepresented by the other vertical lines. It thus ceases to be the\\nprivate property of one experience, and becomes, so to speak, a shared\\nor public thing. We can track its outer history in this way, and\\nrepresent it by the horizontal line. (It is also known representatively\\nat other points of the vertical lines, or intuitively there again,\\nso that the line of its outer history would have to be looped and\\nwandering, but I make it straight for simplicity\\'s sake.)] In any case,\\nhowever, it is the same stuff figures in all the sets of lines.\\n\\nTO KNOW IMMEDIATELY, THEN, OR INTUITIVELY, IS FOR MENTAL CONTENT AND\\nOBJECT TO BE IDENTICAL. This is a very different definition from that\\nwhich we gave of representative knowledge; but neither definition\\ninvolves those mysterious notions of self-transcendency and presence in\\nabsence which are such essential parts of the ideas of knowledge, both\\nof philosophers and of common men. [Footnote: The reader will observe\\nthat the text is written from the point of view of NAIF realism or\\ncommon sense, and avoids raising the idealistic controversy.]\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nHUMANISM AND TRUTH [Footnote: Reprinted, with slight verbal revision,\\nfrom Mind, vol. xiii, N. S., p. 457 (October, 1904). A couple of\\ninterpolations from another article in Mind, \\'Humanism and truth once\\nmore,\\' in vol. xiv, have been made.]\\n\\nRECEIVING from the Editor of Mind an advance proof of Mr. Bradley\\'s\\narticle on \\'Truth and Practice,\\' I understand this as a hint to me to\\njoin in the controversy over \\'Pragmatism\\' which seems to have seriously\\nbegun. As my name has been coupled with the movement, I deem it wise to\\ntake the hint, the more so as in some quarters greater credit has been\\ngiven me than I deserve, and probably undeserved discredit in other\\nquarters falls also to my lot.\\n\\nFirst, as to the word \\'pragmatism.\\' I myself have only used the term\\nto indicate a method of carrying on abstract discussion. The serious\\nmeaning of a concept, says Mr. Peirce, lies in the concrete difference\\nto some one which its being true will make. Strive to bring all\\ndebated conceptions to that\\' pragmatic\\' test, and you will escape\\nvain wrangling: if it can make no practical difference which of two\\nstatements be true, then they are really one statement in two verbal\\nforms; if it can make no practical difference whether a given statement\\nbe true or false, then the statement has no real meaning. In neither\\ncase is there anything fit to quarrel about: we may save our breath, and\\npass to more important things.\\n\\nAll that the pragmatic method implies, then, is that truths should HAVE\\npractical [Footnote: \\'Practical\\' in the sense of PARTICULAR, of course,\\nnot in the sense that the consequences may not be MENTAL as well as\\nphysical.] consequences. In England the word has been used more broadly\\nstill, to cover the notion that the truth of any statement CONSISTS in\\nthe consequences, and particularly in their being good consequences.\\nHere we get beyond affairs of method altogether; and since my pragmatism\\nand this wider pragmatism are so different, and both are important\\nenough to have different names, I think that Mr. Schiller\\'s proposal\\nto call the wider pragmatism by the name of \\'humanism\\' is excellent and\\nought to be adopted. The narrower pragmatism may still be spoken of as\\nthe \\'pragmatic method.\\'\\n\\nI have read in the past six months many hostile reviews of Schiller\\'s\\nand Dewey\\'s publications; but with the exception of Mr. Bradley\\'s\\nelaborate indictment, they are out of reach where I write, and I have\\nlargely forgotten them. I think that a free discussion of the subject\\non my part would in any case be more useful than a polemic attempt at\\nrebutting these criticisms in detail. Mr. Bradley in particular can be\\ntaken care of by Mr. Schiller. He repeatedly confesses himself unable\\nto comprehend Schiller\\'s views, he evidently has not sought to do so\\nsympathetically, and I deeply regret to say that his laborious article\\nthrows, for my mind, absolutely no useful light upon the subject.\\nIt seems to me on the whole an IGNORATIO ELENCHI, and I feel free to\\ndisregard it altogether.\\n\\nThe subject is unquestionably difficult. Messrs. Dewey\\'s and Schiller\\'s\\nthought is eminently an induction, a generalization working itself free\\nfrom all sorts of entangling particulars. If true, it involves much\\nrestatement of traditional notions. This is a kind of intellectual\\nproduct that never attains a classic form of expression when first\\npromulgated. The critic ought therefore not to be too sharp and\\nlogic-chopping in his dealings with it, but should weigh it as a whole,\\nand especially weigh it against its possible alternatives. One should\\nalso try to apply it first to one instance, and then to another to see\\nhow it will work. It seems to me that it is emphatically not a case\\nfor instant execution, by conviction of intrinsic absurdity or of\\nself-contradiction, or by caricature of what it would look like if\\nreduced to skeleton shape. Humanism is in fact much more like one of\\nthose secular changes that come upon public opinion overnight, as it\\nwere, borne upon tides \\'too deep for sound or foam,\\' that survive all\\nthe crudities and extravagances of their advocates, that you can pin\\nto no one absolutely essential statement, nor kill by any one decisive\\nstab.\\n\\nSuch have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from classic\\nto romantic taste, from theistic to pantheistic feeling, from static to\\nevolutionary ways of understanding life--changes of which we all have\\nbeen spectators. Scholasticism still opposes to such changes the method\\nof confutation by single decisive reasons, showing that the new view\\ninvolves self-contradiction, or traverses some fundamental principle.\\nThis is like stopping a river by planting a stick in the middle of its\\nbed. Round your obstacle flows the water and \\'gets there all the same.\\'\\nIn reading some of our opponents, I am not a little reminded of those\\ncatholic writers who refute darwinism by telling us that higher species\\ncannot come from lower because minus nequit gignere plus, or that the\\nnotion of transformation is absurd, for it implies that species tend to\\ntheir own destruction, and that would violate the principle that every\\nreality tends to persevere in its own shape. The point of view is too\\nmyopic, too tight and close to take in the inductive argument. Wide\\ngeneralizations in science always meet with these summary refutations in\\ntheir early days; but they outlive them, and the refutations then sound\\noddly antiquated and scholastic. I cannot help suspecting that the\\nhumanistic theory is going through this kind of would-be refutation at\\npresent.\\n\\nThe one condition of understanding humanism is to become\\ninductive-minded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions, and follow lines\\nof least, resistance \\'on the whole.\\' \\'In other words,\\' an opponent might\\nsay, \\'resolve your intellect into a kind of slush.\\' \\'Even so,\\' I make\\nreply,--\\'if you will consent to use no politer word.\\' For humanism,\\nconceiving the more \\'true\\' as the more \\'satisfactory\\' (Dewey\\'s term),\\nhas sincerely to renounce rectilinear arguments and ancient ideals\\nof rigor and finality. It is in just this temper of renunciation, so\\ndifferent from that of pyrrhonistic scepticism, that the spirit of\\nhumanism essentially consists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by\\na multitude of standards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in\\nany given case; and what is more satisfactory than any alternative in\\nsight, may to the end be a sum of PLUSES and MINUSES, concerning which\\nwe can only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements\\na maximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be\\napproached. It means a real change of heart, a break with absolutistic\\nhopes, when one takes up this inductive view of the conditions of\\nbelief.\\n\\nAs I understand the pragmatist way of seeing things, it owes its being\\nto the break-down which the last fifty years have brought about in the\\nolder notions of scientific truth. \\'God geometrizes,\\' it used to be\\nsaid; and it was believed that Euclid\\'s elements literally reproduced\\nhis geometrizing. There is an eternal and unchangeable \\'reason\\'; and its\\nvoice was supposed to reverberate in Barbara and Celarent. So also\\nof the \\'laws of nature,\\' physical and chemical, so of natural history\\nclassifications--all were supposed to be exact and exclusive duplicates\\nof pre-human archetypes buried in the structure of things, to which the\\nspark of divinity hidden in our intellect enables us to penetrate. The\\nanatomy of the world is logical, and its logic is that of a university\\nprofessor, it was thought. Up to about 1850 almost every one believed\\nthat sciences expressed truths that were exact copies of a definite\\ncode of non-human realities. But the enormously rapid multiplication of\\ntheories in these latter days has well-nigh upset the notion of any one\\nof them being a more literally objective kind of thing than another.\\nThere are so many geometries, so many logics, so many physical and\\nchemical hypotheses, so many classifications, each one of them good for\\nso much and yet not good for everything, that the notion that even the\\ntruest formula may be a human device and not a literal transcript\\nhas dawned upon us. We hear scientific laws now treated as so much\\n\\'conceptual shorthand,\\' true so far as they are useful but no farther.\\nOur mind has become tolerant of symbol instead of reproduction, of\\napproximation instead of exactness, of plasticity instead of rigor.\\n\\'Energetics,\\' measuring the bare face of sensible phenomena so as to\\ndescribe in a single formula all their changes of \\'level,\\' is the last\\nword of this scientific humanism, which indeed leaves queries enough\\noutstanding as to the reason for so curious a congruence between the\\nworld and the mind, but which at any rate makes our whole notion of\\nscientific truth more flexible and genial than it used to be.\\n\\nIt is to be doubted whether any theorizer to-day, either in mathematics,\\nlogic, physics or biology, conceives himself to be literally re-editing\\nprocesses of nature or thoughts of God. The main forms of our thinking,\\nthe separation of subjects from predicates, the negative, hypothetic\\nand disjunctive judgments, are purely human habits. The ether, as Lord\\nSalisbury said, is only a noun for the verb to undulate; and many of our\\ntheological ideas are admitted, even by those who call them \\'true,\\' to\\nbe humanistic in like degree.\\n\\nI fancy that these changes in the current notions of truth are what\\noriginally gave the impulse to Messrs. Dewey\\'s and Schiller\\'s views.\\nThe suspicion is in the air nowadays that the superiority of one of\\nour formulas to another may not consist so much in its literal\\n\\'objectivity,\\' as in subjective qualities like its usefulness, its\\n\\'elegance\\' or its congruity with our residual beliefs. Yielding to these\\nsuspicions, and generalizing, we fall into something like the humanistic\\nstate of mind. Truth we conceive to mean everywhere, not duplication,\\nbut addition; not the constructing of inner copies of already complete\\nrealities, but rather the collaborating with realities so as to bring\\nabout a clearer result. Obviously this state of mind is at first full of\\nvagueness and ambiguity. \\'Collaborating\\' is a vague term; it must at\\nany rate cover conceptions and logical arrangements. \\'Clearer\\' is vaguer\\nstill. Truth must bring clear thoughts, as well as clear the way to\\naction. \\'Reality\\' is the vaguest term of all. The only way to test such\\na programme at all is to apply it to the various types of truth, in the\\nhope of reaching an account that shall be more precise. Any hypothesis\\nthat forces such a review upon one has one great merit, even if in\\nthe end it prove invalid: it gets us better acquainted with the total\\nsubject. To give the theory plenty of \\'rope\\' and see if it hangs itself\\neventually is better tactics than to choke it off at the outset by\\nabstract accusations of self-contradiction. I think therefore that\\na decided effort at sympathetic mental play with humanism is the\\nprovisional attitude to be recommended to the reader.\\n\\nWhen I find myself playing sympathetically with humanism, something like\\nwhat follows is what I end by conceiving it to mean.\\n\\nExperience is a process that continually gives us new material to\\ndigest. We handle this intellectually by the mass of beliefs of which\\nwe find ourselves already possessed, assimilating, rejecting, or\\nrearranging in different degrees. Some of the apperceiving ideas are\\nrecent acquisitions of our own, but most of them are common-sense\\ntraditions of the race. There is probably not a common-sense tradition,\\nof all those which we now live by, that was not in the first instance\\na genuine discovery, an inductive generalization like those more recent\\nones of the atom, of inertia, of energy, of reflex action, or of fitness\\nto survive The notions of one Time and of one Space as single continuous\\nreceptacles; the distinction between thoughts and things, matter and\\nmind between permanent subjects and changing attributes; the conception\\nof classes with sub classes within them; the separation of fortuitous\\nfrom regularly caused connections; surely all these were once definite\\nconquests made at historic dates by our ancestors in their attempt\\nto get the chaos of their crude individual experiences into a more\\nshareable and manageable shape. They proved of such sovereign use as\\ndenkmittel that they are now a part of the very structure of our mind.\\nWe cannot play fast and loose with them. No experience can upset them.\\nOn the contrary, they apperceive every experience and assign it to its\\nplace.\\n\\nTo what effect? That we may the better foresee the course of our\\nexperiences, communicate with one another, and steer our lives by rule.\\nAlso that we may have a cleaner, clearer, more inclusive mental view.\\n\\nThe greatest common-sense achievement, after the discovery of one Time\\nand one Space, is probably the concept of permanently existing things.\\nWhen a rattle first drops out of the hand of a baby, he does not look to\\nsee where it has gone. Non-perception he accepts as annihilation until\\nhe finds a better belief. That our perceptions mean BEINGS, rattles\\nthat are there whether we hold them in our hands or not, becomes an\\ninterpretation so luminous of what happens to us that, once employed,\\nit never gets forgotten. It applies with equal felicity to things and\\npersons, to the objective and to the ejective realm. However a Berkeley,\\na Mill, or a Cornelius may CRITICISE it, it WORKS; and in practical\\nlife we never think of \\'going back\\' upon it, or reading our incoming\\nexperiences in any other terms. We may, indeed, speculatively imagine\\na state of \\'pure\\' experience before the hypothesis of permanent objects\\nbehind its flux had been framed; and we can play with the idea that some\\nprimeval genius might have struck into a different hypothesis. But we\\ncannot positively imagine today what the different hypothesis could have\\nbeen, for the category of trans-perceptual reality is now one of the\\nfoundations of our life. Our thoughts must still employ it if they are\\nto possess reasonableness and truth.\\n\\nThis notion of a FIRST in the shape of a most chaotic pure experience\\nwhich sets us questions, of a SECOND in the way of fundamental\\ncategories, long ago wrought into the structure of our consciousness and\\npractically irreversible, which define the general frame within which\\nanswers must fall, and of a THIRD which gives the detail of the answers\\nin the shapes most congruous with all our present needs, is, as I take\\nit, the essence of the humanistic conception. It represents experience\\nin its pristine purity to be now so enveloped in predicates historically\\nworked out that we can think of it as little more than an OTHER, of\\na THAT, which the mind, in Mr. Bradley\\'s phrase, \\'encounters,\\' and to\\nwhose stimulating presence we respond by ways of thinking which we\\ncall \\'true\\' in proportion as they facilitate our mental or physical\\nactivities and bring us outer power and inner peace. But whether the\\nOther, the universal THAT, has itself any definite inner structure, or\\nwhether, if it have any, the structure resembles any of our predicated\\nWHATS, this is a question which humanism leaves untouched. For us, at\\nany rate, it insists, reality is an accumulation of our own intellectual\\ninventions, and the struggle for \\'truth\\' in our progressive dealings\\nwith it is always a struggle to work in new nouns and adjectives while\\naltering as little as possible the old.\\n\\nIt is hard to see why either Mr. Bradley\\'s own logic or his\\nmetaphysics should oblige him to quarrel with this conception. He might\\nconsistently adopt it verbatim et literatim, if he would, and simply\\nthrow his peculiar absolute round it, following in this the good example\\nof Professor Royce. Bergson in France, and his disciples, Wilbois the\\nphysicist and Leroy, are thoroughgoing humanists in the sense defined.\\nProfessor Milhaud also appears to be one; and the great Poincare misses\\nit by only the breadth of a hair. In Germany the name of Simmel offers\\nitself as that of a humanist of the most radical sort. Mach and his\\nschool, and Hertz and Ostwald must be classed as humanists. The view is\\nin the atmosphere and must be patiently discussed.\\n\\nThe best way to discuss it would be to see what the alternative\\nmight be. What is it indeed? Its critics make no explicit statement,\\nProfessor Royce being the only one so far who has formulated anything\\ndefinite. The first service of humanism to philosophy accordingly seems\\nto be that it will probably oblige those who dislike it to search their\\nown hearts and heads. It will force analysis to the front and make\\nit the order of the day. At present the lazy tradition that truth is\\nadaequatio intellectus et rei seems all there is to contradict it with.\\nMr. Bradley\\'s only suggestion is that true thought \\'must correspond to\\na determinate being which it cannot be said to make,\\' and obviously that\\nsheds no new light. What is the meaning of the word to \\'correspond\\'?\\nWhere is the \\'being\\'? What sort of things are \\'determinations,\\' and what\\nis meant in this particular case by \\'not to make\\'?\\n\\nHumanism proceeds immediately to refine upon the looseness of these\\nepithets. We correspond in SOME way with anything with which we enter\\ninto any relations at all. If it be a thing, we may produce an exact\\ncopy of it, or we may simply feel it as an existent in a certain place.\\nIf it be a demand, we may obey it without knowing anything more about it\\nthan its push. If it be a proposition, we may agree by not contradicting\\nit, by letting it pass. If it be a relation between things, we may act\\non the first thing so as to bring ourselves out where the second will\\nbe. If it be something inaccessible, we may substitute a hypothetical\\nobject for it, which, having the same consequences, will cipher out for\\nus real results. In a general way we may simply ADD OUR THOUGHT TO IT;\\nand if it SUFFERS THE ADDITION, and the whole situation harmoniously\\nprolongs and enriches itself, the thought will pass for true.\\n\\nAs for the whereabouts of the beings thus corresponded to, although they\\nmay be outside of the present thought as well as in it, humanism sees\\nno ground for saying they are outside of finite experience itself.\\nPragmatically, their reality means that we submit to them, take account\\nof them, whether we like to or not, but this we must perpetually do with\\nexperiences other than our own. The whole system of what the present\\nexperience must correspond to \\'adequately\\' may be continuous with the\\npresent experience itself. Reality, so taken as experience other than\\nthe present, might be either the legacy of past experience or the\\ncontent of experience to come. Its determinations for US are in any\\ncase the adjectives which our acts of judging fit to it, and those are\\nessentially humanistic things.\\n\\nTo say that our thought does not \\'make\\' this reality means pragmatically\\nthat if our own particular thought were annihilated the reality would\\nstill be there in some shape, though possibly it might be a shape\\nthat would lack something that our thought supplies. That reality is\\n\\'independent\\' means that there is something in every experience that\\nescapes our arbitrary control. If it be a sensible experience it coerces\\nour attention; if a sequence, we cannot invert it; if we compare two\\nterms we can come to only one result. There is a push, an urgency,\\nwithin our very experience, against which we are on the whole powerless,\\nand which drives us in a direction that is the destiny of our belief.\\nThat this drift of experience itself is in the last resort due to\\nsomething independent of all possible experience may or may not be true.\\nThere may or may not be an extra-experiential \\'ding an sich\\' that keeps\\nthe ball rolling, or an \\'absolute\\' that lies eternally behind all the\\nsuccessive determinations which human thought has made. But within our\\nexperience ITSELF, at any rate, humanism says, some determinations show\\nthemselves as being independent of others; some questions, if we ever\\nask them, can only be answered in one way; some beings, if we ever\\nsuppose them, must be supposed to have existed previously to the\\nsupposing; some relations, if they exist ever, must exist as long as\\ntheir terms exist.\\n\\nTruth thus means, according to humanism, the relation of less fixed\\nparts of experience (predicates) to other relatively more fixed\\nparts (subjects); and we are not required to seek it in a relation of\\nexperience as such to anything beyond itself. We can stay at home, for\\nour behavior as exponents is hemmed in on every side. The forces both of\\nadvance and of resistance are exerted by our own objects, and the notion\\nof truth as something opposed to waywardness or license inevitably grows\\nup SOLIPSISTICALLY inside of every human life.\\n\\nSo obvious is all this that a common charge against the humanistic\\nauthors \\'makes me tired.\\' \\'How can a deweyite discriminate sincerity\\nfrom bluff?\\' was a question asked at a philosophic meeting where I\\nreported on Dewey\\'s Studies. \\'How can the mere [Footnote: I know of no\\n\\'mere\\' pragmatist, if MERENESS here means, as it seems to, the denial of\\nall concreteness to the pragmatist\\'s THOUGHT.] pragmatist feel any duty\\nto think truly?\\' is the objection urged by Professor Royce. Mr. Bradley\\nin turn says that if a humanist understands his own doctrine, \\'he must\\nhold any idea, however mad, to be the truth, if any one will have it\\nso.\\' And Professor Taylor describes pragmatism as believing anything one\\npleases and calling it truth.\\n\\nSuch a shallow sense of the conditions under which men\\'s thinking\\nactually goes on seems to me most surprising. These critics appear to\\nsuppose that, if left to itself, the rudderless raft of our experience\\nmust be ready to drift anywhere or nowhere. Even THO there were\\ncompasses on board, they seem to say, there would be no pole for them\\nto point to. There must be absolute sailing-directions, they insist,\\ndecreed from outside, and an independent chart of the voyage added to\\nthe \\'mere\\' voyage itself, if we are ever to make a port. But is it not\\nobvious that even THO there be such absolute sailing-directions in the\\nshape of pre-human standards of truth that we OUGHT to follow, the\\nonly guarantee that we shall in fact follow them must lie in our human\\nequipment. The \\'ought\\' would be a brutum fulmen unless there were a felt\\ngrain inside of our experience that conspired. As a matter of fact the\\nDEVOUTEST believers in absolute standards must admit that men fail to\\nobey them. Waywardness is here, in spite of the eternal prohibitions,\\nand the existence of any amount of reality ante rem is no warrant\\nagainst unlimited error in rebus being incurred. The only REAL guarantee\\nwe have against licentious thinking is the CIRCUMPRESSURE of experience\\nitself, which gets us sick of concrete errors, whether there be a\\ntrans-empirical reality or not. How does the partisan of absolute\\nreality know what this orders him to think? He cannot get direct sight\\nof the absolute; and he has no means of guessing what it wants of him\\nexcept by following the humanistic clues. The only truth that he\\nhimself will ever practically ACCEPT will be that to which his finite\\nexperiences lead him of themselves. The state of mind which shudders\\nat the idea of a lot of experiences left to themselves, and that\\naugurs protection from the sheer name of an absolute, as if, however\\ninoperative, that might still stand for a sort of ghostly security, is\\nlike the mood of those good people who, whenever they hear of a\\nsocial tendency that is damnable, begin to redden and to puff, and\\nsay \\'Parliament or Congress ought to make a law against it,\\' as if an\\nimpotent decree would give relief.\\n\\nAll the SANCTIONS of a law of truth lie in the very texture of\\nexperience. Absolute or no absolute, the concrete truth FOR US will\\nalways be that way of thinking in which our various experiences most\\nprofitably combine.\\n\\nAnd yet, the opponent obstinately urges, your humanist will always\\nhave a greater liberty to play fast and loose with truth than will your\\nbeliever in an independent realm of reality that makes the standard\\nrigid. If by this latter believer he means a man who pretends to know\\nthe standard and who fulminates it, the humanist will doubtless prove\\nmore flexible; but no more flexible than the absolutist himself if the\\nlatter follows (as fortunately our present-day absolutists do follow)\\nempirical methods of inquiry in concrete affairs. To consider hypotheses\\nis surely always better than to DOGMATISE ins blaue hinein.\\n\\nNevertheless this probable flexibility of temper in him has been used\\nto convict the humanist of sin. Believing as he does, that truth lies in\\nrebus, and is at every moment our own line of most propitious reaction,\\nhe stands forever debarred, as I have heard a learned colleague say,\\nfrom trying to convert opponents, for does not their view, being THEIR\\nmost propitious momentary reaction, already fill the bill? Only the\\nbeliever in the ante-rem brand of truth can on this theory seek to\\nmake converts without self-stultification. But can there be\\nself-stultification in urging any account whatever of truth? Can\\nthe definition ever contradict the deed? \\'Truth is what I feel like\\nsaying\\'--suppose that to be the definition. \\'Well, I feel like saying\\nthat, and I want you to feel like saying it, and shall continue to say\\nit until I get you to agree.\\' Where is there any contradiction? Whatever\\ntruth may be said to be, that is the kind of truth which the saying\\ncan be held to carry. The TEMPER which a saying may comport is an\\nextra-logical matter. It may indeed be hotter in some individual\\nabsolutist than in a humanist, but it need not be so in another. And the\\nhumanist, for his part, is perfectly consistent in compassing sea and\\nland to make one proselyte, if his nature be enthusiastic enough.\\n\\n\\'But how can you be enthusiastic over any view of things which you\\nknow to have been partly made by yourself, and which is liable to alter\\nduring the next minute? How is any heroic devotion to the ideal of truth\\npossible under such paltry conditions?\\'\\n\\nThis is just another of those objections by which the anti-humanists\\nshow their own comparatively slack hold on the realities of the\\nsituation. If they would only follow the pragmatic method and ask:\\n\\'What is truth KNOWN-AS? What does its existence stand for in the way of\\nconcrete goods?\\'--they would see that the name of it is the inbegriff\\nof almost everything that is valuable in our lives. The true is\\nthe opposite of whatever is instable, of whatever is practically\\ndisappointing, of whatever is useless, of whatever is lying and\\nunreliable, of whatever is unverifiable and unsupported, of whatever is\\ninconsistent and contradictory, of whatever is artificial and eccentric,\\nof whatever is unreal in the sense of being of no practical account.\\nHere are pragmatic reasons with a vengeance why we should turn to\\ntruth--truth saves us from a world of that complexion. What wonder that\\nits very name awakens loyal feeling! In particular what wonder that all\\nlittle provisional fool\\'s paradises of belief should appear contemptible\\nin comparison with its bare pursuit! When absolutists reject humanism\\nbecause they feel it to be untrue, that means that the whole habit of\\ntheir mental needs is wedded already to a different view of reality, in\\ncomparison with which the humanistic world seems but the whim of a few\\nirresponsible youths. Their own subjective apperceiving mass is what\\nspeaks here in the name of the eternal natures and bids them reject\\nour humanism--as they apprehend it. Just so with us humanists, when\\nwe condemn all noble, clean-cut, fixed, eternal, rational, temple-like\\nsystems of philosophy. These contradict the DRAMATIC TEMPERAMENT of\\nnature, as our dealings with nature and our habits of thinking have so\\nfar brought us to conceive it. They seem oddly personal and artificial,\\neven when not bureaucratic and professional in an absurd degree. We turn\\nfrom them to the great unpent and unstayed wilderness of truth as we\\nfeel it to be constituted, with as good a conscience as rationalists\\nare moved by when they turn from our wilderness into their neater and\\ncleaner intellectual abodes. [Footnote: I cannot forbear quoting as an\\nillustration of the contrast between humanist and rationalist tempers of\\nmind, in a sphere remote from philosophy, these remarks on the Dreyfus\\n\\'affaire,\\' written by one who assuredly had never heard of humanism or\\npragmatism. \\'Autant que la Revolution, \"l\\'Affaire\" est desormais une de\\nnos \"origines.\" Si elle n\\'a pas fait ouvrir le gouffre, c\\'est elle du\\nmoins qui a rendu patent et visible le long travail souterrain qui,\\nsilencieusement, avait prepare la separation entre nos deux camps\\nd\\'aujourd\\'hui, pour ecarter enfin, d\\'un coup soudain, la France\\ndes traditionalistes (poseurs de principes, chercheurs d\\'unite,\\nconstructeurs de systemes a priori) el la France eprise du fait positif\\net de libre examen;--la France revolutionnaire et romantique si l\\'on\\nveut, celle qui met tres haut l\\'individu, qui ne veut pas qu\\'un juste\\nperisse, fut-ce pour sauver la nation, et qui cherche la verite dans\\ntoutes ses parties aussi bien que dans une vue d\\'ensemble ... Duclaux ne\\npouvait pas concevoir qu\\'on preferat quelque chose a la verite. Mais il\\nvoyait autour de lui de fort honnetes gens qui, mettant en balance la\\nvie d\\'un homme et la raison d\\'Etat, lui avouaient de quel poids leger\\nils jugeaient une simple existence individuelle, pour innocente qu\\'elle\\nfut. C\\'etaient des classiques, des gens a qui l\\'ensemble seul importe.\\'\\nLa Vie de Emile Duclaux, par Mme. Em. D., Laval, 1906, pp. 243,\\n247-248.]\\n\\nThis is surely enough to show that the humanist does not ignore the\\ncharacter of objectivity and independence in truth. Let me turn next to\\nwhat his opponents mean when they say that to be true, our thoughts must\\n\\'correspond.\\'\\n\\nThe vulgar notion of correspondence here is that the thoughts must COPY\\nthe reality--cognitio fit per assimiliationem cogniti et cognoscentis;\\nand philosophy, without having ever fairly sat down to the question,\\nseems to have instinctively accepted this idea: propositions are held\\ntrue if they copy the eternal thought; terms are held true if they copy\\nextra-mental realities. Implicitly, I think that the copy-theory has\\nanimated most of the criticisms that have been made on humanism.\\n\\nA priori, however, it is not self-evident that the sole business of\\nour mind with realities should be to copy them. Let my reader suppose\\nhimself to constitute for a time all the reality there is in the\\nuniverse, and then to receive the announcement that another being is to\\nbe created who shall know him truly. How will he represent the knowing\\nin advance? What will he hope it to be? I doubt extremely whether it\\ncould ever occur to him to fancy it as a mere copying. Of what use to\\nhim would an imperfect second edition of himself in the new comer\\'s\\ninterior be? It would seem pure waste of a propitious opportunity. The\\ndemand would more probably be for something absolutely new. The reader\\nwould conceive the knowing humanistically, \\'the new comer,\\' he would\\nsay, \\'must TAKE ACCOUNT OF MY PRESENCE BY REACTING ON IT IN SUCH A WAY\\nTHAT GOOD WOULD ACCRUE TO US BOTH. If copying be requisite to that end,\\nlet there be copying; otherwise not.\\' The essence in any case would not\\nbe the copying, but the enrichment of the previous world.\\n\\nI read the other day, in a book of Professor Eucken\\'s, a phrase, \\'Die\\nerhohung des vorgefundenen daseins,\\' which seems to be pertinent here.\\nWhy may not thought\\'s mission be to increase and elevate, rather than\\nsimply to imitate and reduplicate, existence? No one who has read Lotze\\ncan fail to remember his striking comment on the ordinary view of the\\nsecondary qualities of matter, which brands them as \\'illusory\\' because\\nthey copy nothing in the thing. The notion of a world complete in\\nitself, to which thought comes as a passive mirror, adding nothing\\nto fact, Lotze says is irrational. Rather is thought itself a most\\nmomentous part of fact, and the whole mission of the pre-existing and\\ninsufficient world of matter may simply be to provoke thought to produce\\nits far more precious supplement.\\n\\n\\'Knowing,\\' in short, may, for aught we can see beforehand to the\\ncontrary, be ONLY ONE WAY OF GETTING INTO FRUITFUL RELATIONS WITH\\nREALITY whether copying be one of the relations or not.\\n\\nIt is easy to see from what special type of knowing the copy-theory\\narose. In our dealings with natural phenomena the great point is to be\\nable to foretell. Foretelling, according to such a writer as Spencer, is\\nthe whole meaning of intelligence. When Spencer\\'s \\'law of intelligence\\'\\nsays that inner and outer relations must \\'correspond,\\' it means that the\\ndistribution of terms in our inner time-scheme and space-scheme must\\nbe an exact copy of the distribution in real time and space of the real\\nterms. In strict theory the mental terms themselves need not answer to\\nthe real terms in the sense of severally copying them, symbolic mental\\nterms being enough, if only the real dates and places be copied. But\\nin our ordinary life the mental terms are images and the real ones are\\nsensations, and the images so often copy the sensations, that we\\neasily take copying of terms as well as of relations to be the natural\\nsignificance of knowing. Meanwhile much, even of this common descriptive\\ntruth, is couched in verbal symbols. If our symbols FIT the world, in\\nthe sense of determining our expectations rightly, they may even be the\\nbetter for not copying its terms.\\n\\nIt seems obvious that the pragmatic account of all this routine of\\nphenomenal knowledge is accurate. Truth here is a relation, not of our\\nideas to non-human realities, but of conceptual parts of our experience\\nto sensational parts. Those thoughts are true which guide us to\\nBENEFICIAL INTERACTION with sensible particulars as they occur, whether\\nthey copy these in advance or not.\\n\\nFrom the frequency of copying in the knowledge of phenomenal fact,\\ncopying has been supposed to be the essence of truth in matters rational\\nalso. Geometry and logic, it has been supposed, must copy archetypal\\nthoughts in the Creator. But in these abstract spheres there is no need\\nof assuming archetypes. The mind is free to carve so many figures out of\\nspace, to make so many numerical collections, to frame so many classes\\nand series, and it can analyze and compare so endlessly, that the very\\nsuperabundance of the resulting ideas makes us doubt the \\'objective\\'\\npre-existence of their models. It would be plainly wrong to suppose a\\nGod whose thought consecrated rectangular but not polar co-ordinates, or\\nJevons\\'s notation but not Boole\\'s. Yet if, on the other hand, we assume\\nGod to have thought in advance of every POSSIBLE flight of human fancy\\nin these directions, his mind becomes too much like a Hindoo idol\\nwith three heads, eight arms and six breasts, too much made up of\\nsuperfoetation and redundancy for us to wish to copy it, and the whole\\nnotion of copying tends to evaporate from these sciences. Their objects\\ncan be better interpreted as being created step by step by men, as fast\\nas they successively conceive them.\\n\\nIf now it be asked how, if triangles, squares, square roots, genera,\\nand the like, are but improvised human \\'artefacts,\\' their properties\\nand relations can be so promptly known to be \\'eternal,\\' the humanistic\\nanswer is easy. If triangles and genera are of our own production we can\\nkeep them invariant. We can make them \\'timeless\\' by expressly decreeing\\nthat on THE THINGS WE MEAN time shall exert no altering effect, that\\nthey are intentionally and it may be fictitiously abstracted from every\\ncorrupting real associate and condition. But relations between\\ninvariant objects will themselves be invariant. Such relations cannot\\nbe happenings, for by hypothesis nothing shall happen to the objects.\\nI have tried to show in the last chapter of my Principles of Psychology\\n[Footnote: Vol. ii, pp. 641 ff.] that they can only be relations of\\ncomparison. No one so far seems to have noticed my suggestion, and I am\\ntoo ignorant of the development of mathematics to feel very confident\\nof my own view. But if it were correct it would solve the difficulty\\nperfectly. Relations of comparison are matters of direct inspection. As\\nsoon as mental objects are mentally compared, they are perceived to\\nbe either like or unlike. But once the same, always the same, once\\ndifferent, always different, under these timeless conditions. Which\\nis as much as to say that truths concerning these man-made objects are\\nnecessary and eternal. We can change our conclusions only by changing\\nour data first.\\n\\nThe whole fabric of the a priori sciences can thus be treated as a\\nman-made product. As Locke long ago pointed out, these sciences have no\\nimmediate connection with fact. Only IF a fact can be humanized by being\\nidentified with any of these ideal objects, is what was true of the\\nobjects now true also of the facts. The truth itself meanwhile was\\noriginally a copy of nothing; it was only a relation directly perceived\\nto obtain between two artificial mental things. [Footnote: Mental things\\nwhich are realities of course within the mental world.]\\n\\nWe may now glance at some special types of knowing, so as to see better\\nwhether the humanistic account fits. On the mathematical and logical\\ntypes we need not enlarge further, nor need we return at much length to\\nthe case of our descriptive knowledge of the course of nature. So far\\nas this involves anticipation, tho that MAY mean copying, it need, as\\nwe saw, mean little more than \\'getting ready\\' in advance. But with many\\ndistant and future objects, our practical relations are to the last\\ndegree potential and remote. In no sense can we now get ready for the\\narrest of the earth\\'s revolution by the tidal brake, for instance; and\\nwith the past, tho we suppose ourselves to know it truly, we have no\\npractical relations at all. It is obvious that, altho interests strictly\\npractical have been the original starting-point of our search for\\ntrue phenomenal descriptions, yet an intrinsic interest in the bare\\ndescribing function has grown up. We wish accounts that shall be true,\\nwhether they bring collateral profit or not. The primitive function has\\ndeveloped its demand for mere exercise. This theoretic curiosity seems\\nto be the characteristically human differentia, and humanism recognizes\\nits enormous scope. A true idea now means not only one that prepares us\\nfor an actual perception. It means also one that might prepare us for\\na merely possible perception, or one that, if spoken, would suggest\\npossible perceptions to others, or suggest actual perceptions which the\\nspeaker cannot share. The ensemble of perceptions thus thought of\\nas either actual or possible form a system which it is obviously\\nadvantageous to us to get into a stable and consistent shape; and here\\nit is that the common-sense notion of permanent beings finds triumphant\\nuse. Beings acting outside of the thinker explain, not only his actual\\nperceptions, past and future, but his possible perceptions and those\\nof every one else. Accordingly they gratify our theoretic need in a\\nsupremely beautiful way. We pass from our immediate actual through\\nthem into the foreign and the potential, and back again into the future\\nactual, accounting for innumerable particulars by a single cause. As\\nin those circular panoramas, where a real foreground of dirt, grass,\\nbushes, rocks and a broken-down cannon is enveloped by a canvas picture\\nof sky and earth and of a raging battle, continuing the foreground so\\ncunningly that the spectator can detect no joint; so these conceptual\\nobjects, added to our present perceptual reality, fuse with it into the\\nwhole universe of our belief. In spite of all berkeleyan criticism, we\\ndo not doubt that they are really there. Tho our discovery of any one of\\nthem may only date from now, we unhesitatingly say that it not only\\nIS, but WAS there, if, by so saying, the past appears connected more\\nconsistently with what we feel the present to be. This is historic\\ntruth. Moses wrote the Pentateuch, we think, because if he didn\\'t, all\\nour religious habits will have to be undone. Julius Caesar was real, or\\nwe can never listen to history again. Trilobites were once alive, or\\nall our thought about the strata is at sea. Radium, discovered only\\nyesterday, must always have existed, or its analogy with other natural\\nelements, which are permanent, fails. In all this, it is but one portion\\nof our beliefs reacting on another so as to yield the most satisfactory\\ntotal state of mind. That state of mind, we say, sees truth, and the\\ncontent of its deliverances we believe.\\n\\nOf course, if you take the satisfactoriness concretely, as something\\nfelt by you now, and if, by truth, you mean truth taken abstractly\\nand verified in the long run, you cannot make them equate, for it is\\nnotorious that the temporarily satisfactory is often false. Yet at each\\nand every concrete moment, truth for each man is what that man \\'troweth\\'\\nat that moment with the maximum of satisfaction to himself; and\\nsimilarly, abstract truth, truth verified by the long run, and abstract\\nsatisfactoriness, long-run satisfactoriness, coincide. If, in short, we\\ncompare concrete with concrete and abstract with abstract, the true\\nand the satisfactory do mean the same thing. I suspect that a certain\\nmuddling of matters hereabouts is what makes the general philosophic\\npublic so impervious to humanism\\'s claims.\\n\\nThe fundamental fact about our experience is that it is a process of\\nchange. For the \\'trower\\' at any moment, truth, like the visible area\\nround a man walking in a fog, or like what George Eliot calls \\'the\\nwall of dark seen by small fishes\\' eyes that pierce a span in the wide\\nOcean,\\' is an objective field which the next moment enlarges and of\\nwhich it is the critic, and which then either suffers alteration or is\\ncontinued unchanged. The critic sees both the first trower\\'s truth and\\nhis own truth, compares them with each other, and verifies or confutes.\\nHIS field of view is the reality independent of that earlier trower\\'s\\nthinking with which that thinking ought to correspond. But the critic\\nis himself only a trower; and if the whole process of experience should\\nterminate at that instant, there would be no otherwise known independent\\nreality with which HIS thought might be compared.\\n\\nThe immediate in experience is always provisionally in this situation.\\nThe humanism, for instance, which I see and try so hard to defend, is\\nthe completest truth attained from my point of view up to date. But,\\nowing to the fact that all experience is a process, no point of view can\\never be THE last one. Every one is insufficient and off its balance, and\\nresponsible to later points of view than itself. You, occupying some of\\nthese later points in your own person, and believing in the reality of\\nothers, will not agree that my point of view sees truth positive, truth\\ntimeless, truth that counts, unless they verify and confirm what it\\nsees.\\n\\nYou generalize this by saying that any opinion, however satisfactory,\\ncan count positively and absolutely as true only so far as it agrees\\nwith a standard beyond itself; and if you then forget that this standard\\nperpetually grows up endogenously inside the web of the experiences,\\nyou may carelessly go on to say that what distributively holds of\\neach experience, holds also collectively of all experience, and that\\nexperience as such and in its totality owes whatever truth it may be\\npossessed-of to its correspondence with absolute realities outside of\\nits own being. This evidently is the popular and traditional position.\\nFrom the fact that finite experiences must draw support from one\\nanother, philosophers pass to the notion that experience uberhaupt must\\nneed an absolute support. The denial of such a notion by humanism lies\\nprobably at the root of most of the dislike which it incurs.\\n\\nBut is this not the globe, the elephant and the tortoise over again?\\nMust not something end by supporting itself? Humanism is willing to let\\nfinite experience be self-supporting. Somewhere being must immediately\\nbreast nonentity. Why may not the advancing front of experience,\\ncarrying its immanent satisfactions and dissatisfactions, cut against\\nthe black inane as the luminous orb of the moon cuts the caerulean\\nabyss? Why should anywhere the world be absolutely fixed and finished?\\nAnd if reality genuinely grows, why may it not grow in these very\\ndeterminations which here and now are made?\\n\\nIn point of fact it actually seems to grow by our mental determinations,\\nbe these never so \\'true.\\' Take the \\'great bear\\' or \\'dipper\\'\\nconstellation in the heavens. We call it by that name, we count the\\nstars and call them seven, we say they were seven before they were\\ncounted, and we say that whether any one had ever noted the fact or not,\\nthe dim resemblance to a long-tailed (or long-necked?) animal was always\\ntruly there. But what do we mean by this projection into past eternity\\nof recent human ways of thinking? Did an \\'absolute\\' thinker actually\\ndo the counting, tell off the stars upon his standing number-tally, and\\nmake the bear-comparison, silly as the latter is? Were they explicitly\\nseven, explicitly bear-like, before the human witness came? Surely\\nnothing in the truth of the attributions drives us to think this.\\nThey were only implicitly or virtually what we call them, and we human\\nwitnesses first explicated them and made them \\'real.\\' A fact virtually\\npre-exists when every condition of its realization save one is already\\nthere. In this case the condition lacking is the act of the counting and\\ncomparing mind. But the stars (once the mind considers them) themselves\\ndictate the result. The counting in no wise modifies their previous\\nnature, and, they being what and where they are, the count cannot fall\\nout differently. It could then ALWAYS be made. NEVER could the number\\nseven be questioned, IF THE QUESTION ONCE WERE RAISED.\\n\\nWe have here a quasi-paradox. Undeniably something comes by the counting\\nthat was not there before. And yet that something was ALWAYS TRUE. In\\none sense you create it, and in another sense you FIND it. You have to\\ntreat your count as being true beforehand, the moment you come to treat\\nthe matter at all.\\n\\nOur stellar attributes must always be called true, then; yet none the\\nless are they genuine additions made by our intellect to the world of\\nfact. Not additions of consciousness only, but additions of \\'content.\\'\\nThey copy nothing that pre-existed, yet they agree with what\\npre-existed, fit it, amplify it, relate and connect it with a \\'wain,\\'\\na number-tally, or what not, and build it out. It seems to me that\\nhumanism is the only theory that builds this case out in the good\\ndirection, and this case stands for innumerable other kinds of case. In\\nall such eases, odd as it may sound, our judgment may actually be said\\nto retroact and to enrich the past.\\n\\nOur judgments at any rate change the character of FUTURE reality by\\nthe acts to which they lead. Where these acts are acts expressive of\\ntrust,--trust, e.g., that a man is honest, that our health is good\\nenough, or that we can make a successful effort,--which acts may be a\\nneeded antecedent of the trusted things becoming true. Professor Taylor\\nsays [Footnote: In an article criticising Pragmatism (as he conceives\\nit) in the McGill University Quarterly published at Montreal, for May,\\n1904.] that our trust is at any rate UNTRUE WHEN IT IS MADE, i. e;\\nbefore the action; and I seem to remember that he disposes of anything\\nlike a faith in the general excellence of the universe (making the\\nfaithful person\\'s part in it at any rate more excellent) as a \\'lie in\\nthe soul.\\' But the pathos of this expression should not blind us to\\nthe complication of the facts. I doubt whether Professor Taylor would\\nhimself be in favor of practically handling trusters of these kinds as\\nliars. Future and present really mix in such emergencies, and one can\\nalways escape lies in them by using hypothetic forms. But Mr. Taylor\\'s\\nattitude suggests such absurd possibilities of practice that it seems\\nto me to illustrate beautifully how self-stultifying the conception of\\na truth that shall merely register a standing fixture may become.\\nTheoretic truth, truth of passive copying, sought in the sole interests\\nof copying as such, not because copying is GOOD FOR SOMETHING, but\\nbecause copying ought schlechthin to be, seems, if you look at it\\ncoldly, to be an almost preposterous ideal. Why should the universe,\\nexisting in itself, also exist in copies? How CAN it be copied in the\\nsolidity of its objective fulness? And even if it could, what would the\\nmotive be? \\'Even the hairs of your head are numbered.\\' Doubtless they\\nare, virtually; but why, as an absolute proposition, OUGHT the number to\\nbecome copied and known? Surely knowing is only one way of interacting\\nwith reality and adding to its effect.\\n\\nThe opponent here will ask: \\'Has not the knowing of truth any\\nsubstantive value on its own account, apart from the collateral\\nadvantages it may bring? And if you allow theoretic satisfactions to\\nexist at all, do they not crowd the collateral satisfactions out of\\nhouse and home, and must not pragmatism go into bankruptcy, if she\\nadmits them at all?\\' The destructive force of such talk disappears as\\nsoon as we use words concretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in our\\nquality of good pragmatists, just what the famous theoretic needs are\\nknown as and in what the intellectual satisfactions consist.\\n\\nAre they not all mere matters of CONSISTENCY--and emphatically NOT of\\nconsistency between an absolute reality and the mind\\'s copies of it,\\nbut of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and habits of\\nreacting, in the mind\\'s own experienceable world? And are not both our\\nneed of such consistency and our pleasure in it conceivable as\\noutcomes of the natural fact that we are beings that do develop mental\\nHABITS--habit itself proving adaptively beneficial in an environment\\nwhere the same objects, or the same kinds of objects, recur and follow\\n\\'law\\'? If this were so, what would have come first would have been the\\ncollateral profits of habit as such, and the theoretic life would have\\ngrown up in aid of these. In point of fact, this seems to have been the\\nprobable case. At life\\'s origin, any present perception may have been\\n\\'true\\'--if such a word could then be applicable. Later, when reactions\\nbecame organized, the reactions became \\'true\\' whenever expectation was\\nfulfilled by them. Otherwise they were \\'false\\' or \\'mistaken\\' reactions.\\nBut the same class of objects needs the same kind of reaction, so the\\nimpulse to react consistently must gradually have been established, and\\na disappointment felt whenever the results frustrated expectation.\\nHere is a perfectly plausible germ for all our higher consistencies.\\nNowadays, if an object claims from us a reaction of the kind habitually\\naccorded only to the opposite class of objects, our mental machinery\\nrefuses to run smoothly. The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory.\\n\\nTheoretic truth thus falls WITHIN the mind, being the accord of some\\nof its processes and objects with other processes and objects--\\'accord\\'\\nconsisting here in well-definable relations. So long as the satisfaction\\nof feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever collateral profits\\nmay seem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the\\nbalance--provided always that we are highly organized intellectually,\\nwhich the majority of us are not. The amount of accord which satisfies\\nmost men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between\\ntheir usual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of\\nsense-perceptions in which their lives are cast. The theoretic truth\\nthat most of us think we \\'ought\\' to attain to is thus the possession of\\na set of predicates that do not explicitly contradict their subjects.\\nWe preserve it as often as not by leaving other predicates and subjects\\nout.\\n\\nIn some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others. The form\\nof inner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at which collateral\\nprofits stop. Such men systematize and classify and schematize and\\nmake synoptical tables and invent ideal objects for the pure love of\\nunifying. Too often the results, glowing with \\'truth\\' for the inventors,\\nseem pathetically personal and artificial to bystanders. Which is as\\nmuch as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truth can leave us\\nin the lurch as easily as any other criterion, and that the absolutists,\\nfor all their pretensions, are \\'in the same boat\\' concretely with those\\nwhom they attack.\\n\\nI am well aware that this paper has been rambling in the extreme. But\\nthe whole subject is inductive, and sharp logic is hardly yet in order.\\nMy great trammel has been the non-existence of any definitely stated\\nalternative on my opponents\\' part. It may conduce to clearness if I\\nrecapitulate, in closing, what I conceive the main points of humanism to\\nbe. They are these:--\\n\\n1. An experience, perceptual or conceptual, must conform to reality in\\norder to be true.\\n\\n2. By \\'reality\\' humanism means nothing more than the other conceptual\\nor perceptual experiences with which a given present experience may find\\nitself in point of fact mixed up. [Footnote: This is meant merely to\\nexclude reality of an \\'unknowable\\' sort, of which no account in either\\nperceptual or conceptual terms can be given. It includes of course any\\namount if empirical reality independent of the knower. Pragmatism, is\\nthus \\'epistemologically\\' realistic in its account.]\\n\\n3. By \\'conforming,\\' humanism means taking account-of in such a way as to\\ngain any intellectually and practically satisfactory result.\\n\\n4. To \\'take account-of\\' and to be \\'satisfactory\\' are terms that admit\\nof no definition, so many are the ways in which these requirements can\\npractically be worked out.\\n\\n5. Vaguely and in general, we take account of a reality by preserving\\nit in as unmodified a form as possible. But, to be then satisfactory, it\\nmust not contradict other realities outside of it which claim also to be\\npreserved. That we must preserve all the experience we can and minimize\\ncontradiction in what we preserve, is about all that can be said in\\nadvance.\\n\\n6. The truth which the conforming experience embodies may be a positive\\naddition to the previous reality, and later judgments may have\\nto conform to it. Yet, virtually at least, it may have been true\\npreviously. Pragmatically, virtual and actual truth mean the same thing:\\nthe possibility of only one answer, when once the question is raised.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nTHE RELATION BETWEEN KNOWER AND KNOWN\\n\\n[Footnote: Extract from an article entitled \\'A World of Pure\\nExperience,\\' in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., September 29,1904.]\\n\\nThroughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object\\nhave been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and thereupon\\nthe presence of the latter to the former, or the \\'apprehension\\' by the\\nformer of the latter, has assumed a paradoxical character which all\\nsorts of theories had to be invented to overcome. Representative\\ntheories put a mental \\'representation,\\' \\'image,\\' or \\'content\\' into\\nthe gap, as a sort of intermediary. Commonsense theories left the gap\\nuntouched, declaring our mind able to clear it by a self-transcending\\nleap. Transcendentalist theories left it impossible to traverse by\\nfinite knowers, and brought an absolute in to perform the saltatory\\nact. All the while, in the very bosom of the finite experience, every\\nconjunction required to make the relation intelligible is given in full.\\nEither the knower and the known are:\\n\\n(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different\\ncontexts; or they are\\n\\n(2) two pieces of ACTUAL experience belonging to the same subject, with\\ndefinite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience between them; or\\n\\n(3) the known is a POSSIBLE experience either of that subject or\\nanother, to which the said conjunctive transitions WOULD lead, if\\nsufficiently prolonged.\\n\\nTo discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the\\nknower of another, would be incompatible with the limits of this essay.\\nI have treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called perception, in\\nan article in the Journal of Philosophy, for September 1, 1904, called\\n\\'Does consciousness exist?\\' This is the type of case in which the mind\\nenjoys direct \\'acquaintance\\' with a present object. In the other types\\nthe mind has \\'knowledge-about\\' an object not immediately there. Type 3\\ncan always formally and hypothetically be reduced to type 2, so that\\na brief description of that type will now put the present reader\\nsufficiently at my point of view, and make him see what the actual\\nmeanings of the mysterious cognitive relation may be.\\n\\nSuppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten\\nminutes\\' walk from \\'Memorial Hall,\\' and to be thinking truly of the\\nlatter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it may have\\na clear image, or it may have a very dim image of the hall, but such an\\nintrinsic difference in the image makes no difference in its cognitive\\nfunction. Certain extrinsic phenomena, special experiences of\\nconjunction, are what impart to the image, be it what it may, its\\nknowing office.\\n\\nFor instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can\\ntell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead you towards the Harvard\\nDelta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the Hall I see\\nbe what I had in mind or not; you would rightly deny that I had \\'meant\\'\\nthat particular hall at all, even tho my mental image might to some\\ndegree have resembled it. The resemblance would count in that case as\\ncoincidental merely, for all sorts of things of a kind resemble one\\nanother in this world without being held for that reason to take\\ncognizance of one another.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of its\\nhistory and present uses; if in its presence I feel my idea, however\\nimperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now TERMINATED;\\nif the associates of the image and of the felt hall run parallel, so\\nthat each term of the one context corresponds serially, as I walk, with\\nan answering term of the other; why then my soul was prophetic, and\\nmy idea must be, and by common consent would be, called cognizant of\\nreality. That percept was what I MEANT, for into it my idea has passed\\nby conjunctive experiences of sameness and fulfilled intention. Nowhere\\nis there jar, but every later moment continues and corroborates an\\nearlier one.\\n\\nIn this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense,\\nbut denoting definitely felt transitions, LIES ALL THAT THE KNOWING OF\\nA PERCEPT BY AN IDEA CAN POSSIBLY CONTAIN OR SIGNIFY. Wherever such\\ntransitions are felt, the first experience KNOWS the last one. Where\\nthey do not, or where even as possibles they can not, intervene, there\\ncan be no pretence of knowing. In this latter case the extremes will be\\nconnected, if connected at all, by inferior relations--bare likeness or\\nsuccession, or by \\'withness\\' alone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus\\ncomes to life inside the tissue of experience. It is MADE; and made\\nby relations that unroll themselves in time. Whenever certain\\nintermediaries are given, such that, as they develop towards their\\nterminus, there is experience from point to point of one direction\\nfollowed, and finally of one process fulfilled, the result is that THEIR\\nSTARTING-POINT THEREBY BECOMES A KNOWER AND THEIR TERMINUS AN OBJECT\\nMEANT OR KNOWN. That is all that knowing (in the simple case considered)\\ncan be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put into experiential\\nterms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we may freely\\nsay that we had the terminal object \\'in mind\\' from the outset, even\\naltho AT the outset nothing was there in us but a flat piece of\\nsubstantive experience like any other, with no self-transcendency about\\nit, and no mystery save the mystery of coming into existence and of\\nbeing gradually followed by other pieces of substantive experience, with\\nconjunctively transitional experiences between. That is what we MEAN\\nhere by the object\\'s being \\'in mind.\\' Of any deeper more real way of its\\nbeing in mind we have no positive conception, and we have no right to\\ndiscredit our actual experience by talking of such a way at all.\\n\\nI know that many a reader will rebel at this. \\'Mere intermediaries,\\' he\\nwill say, \\'even tho they be feelings of continuously growing fulfilment,\\nonly SEPARATE the knower from the known, whereas what we have in\\nknowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one by the other, an\\n\"apprehension\" in the etymological sense of the word, a leaping of the\\nchasm as by lightning, an act by which two terms are smitten into one\\nover the head of their distinctness. All these dead intermediaries of\\nyours are out of each other, and outside of their termini still.\\'\\n\\nBut do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his\\nbone and snapping at its image in the water? If we knew any more real\\nkind of union aliunde, we might be entitled to brand all our empirical\\nunions as a sham. But unions by continuous transition are the only ones\\nwe know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about that terminates\\nin an acquaintance, whether in personal identity, in logical prediction\\nthrough the copula \\'is,\\' or elsewhere. If anywhere there were more\\nabsolute unions, they could only reveal themselves to us by just such\\nconjunctive results. These are what the unions are worth, these are all\\nthat we can ever practically mean by union, by continuity. Is it not\\ntime to repeat what Lotze said of substances, that to act like one is to\\nbe one? Should we not say here that to be experienced as continuous is\\nto be really continuous, in a world where experience and reality come to\\nthe same thing? In a picture gallery a painted hook will serve to hang\\na painted chain by, a painted cable will hold a painted ship. In a world\\nwhere both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience,\\nconjunctions that are experienced must be at least as real as anything\\nelse. They will be \\'absolutely\\' real conjunctions, if we have no\\ntransphenomenal absolute ready, to derealize the whole experienced world\\nby, at a stroke.\\n\\nSo much for the essentials of the cognitive relation where the knowledge\\nis conceptual in type, or forms knowledge \\'about\\' an object. It consists\\nin intermediary experiences (possible, if not actual) of continuously\\ndeveloping progress, and, finally, of fulfilment, when the sensible\\npercept which is the object is reached. The percept here not only\\nVERIFIES the concept, proves its function of knowing that percept to\\nbe true, but the percept\\'s existence as the terminus of the chain of\\nintermediaries CREATES the function. Whatever terminates that chain was,\\nbecause it now proves itself to be, what the concept \\'had in mind.\\'\\n\\nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies\\nin the tact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\\nREPRESENTATIVE, not in any quasi-miraculous \\'epistemological\\' sense,\\nbut in the definite, practical sense of being its substitute in various\\noperations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to\\nits associates and results. By experimenting on our ideas of reality, we\\nmay save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the real experiences\\nwhich they severally mean. The ideas form related systems, corresponding\\npoint for point to the systems which the realities form; and by letting\\nan ideal term call up its associates systematically, we may be led to a\\nterminus which the corresponding real term would have led to in case\\nwe had operated on the real world. And this brings us to the general\\nquestion of substitution.\\n\\nWhat, exactly, in a system of experiences, does the \\'substitution\\' of\\none of them for another mean?\\n\\nAccording to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time,\\nwhereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded by others\\nthat follow upon them by transitions which, whether disjunctive or\\nconjunctive in content, are themselves experiences, and must in general\\nbe accounted at least as real as the terms which they relate. What the\\nnature of the event called \\'superseding\\' signifies, depends altogether\\non the kind of transition that obtains. Some experiences simply abolish\\ntheir predecessors without continuing them in any way. Others are felt\\nto increase or to enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or\\nto bring us nearer to their goal. They \\'represent\\' them, and may fulfil\\ntheir function better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to \\'fulfil\\na function\\' in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined\\nin only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals (or\\nterminations) are the only events that happen, tho they happen by so\\nmany sorts of path. The only function that one experience can perform is\\nto lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment we can speak of\\nis the reaching of a certain experienced end. When one experience leads\\nto (or can lead to) the same end as another, they agree in function. But\\nthe whole system of experiences as they are immediately given presents\\nitself as a quasi-chaos through which one can pass out of an initial\\nterm in many directions and yet end in the same terminus, moving from\\nnext to next by a great many possible paths.\\n\\nEither one of these paths might be a functional substitute for\\nanother, and to follow one rather than another might on occasion be an\\nadvantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general way,\\nthe paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through\\n\\'thoughts\\' or \\'ideas\\' that \\'know\\' the things in which they terminate,\\nare highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield\\ninconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the \\'universal\\' character\\n[Footnote: Of which all that need be said in this essay is that it also\\nan be conceived as functional, and defined in terms of transitions, or\\nof the possibility of such.] which they frequently possess, and to\\ntheir capacity for association with one another in great systems, they\\noutstrip the tardy consecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us\\non towards our ultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the\\nfollowing of trains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are\\nthe new cuts and the short-circuits the thought-paths make. Most\\nthought-paths, it is true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they end\\noutside the real world altogether, in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions\\nor mistakes. But where they do re-enter reality and terminate therein,\\nwe substitute them always; and with these substitutes we pass the\\ngreater number of our hours. [Footnote: This is why I called our\\nexperiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos. There is vastly more\\ndiscontinuity in the sum total of experiences than we commonly suppose.\\nThe objective nucleus of every man\\'s experience, his own body, is, it is\\ntrue, a continuous percept; and equally continuous as a percept (though\\nwe may be inattentive to it) is the material environment of that body,\\nchanging by gradual transition when the body moves. But the distant\\nparts of the physical world are at all times absent from us, and form\\nconceptual objects merely, into the perceptual reality of which our\\nlife inserts itself at points discrete and relatively rare. Round their\\nseveral objective nuclei, partly shared and common partly discrete of\\nthe real physical world, innumerable thinkers, pursuing their several\\nlines of physically true cogitation, trace paths that intersect one\\nanother only at discontinuous perceptual points, and the rest of\\nthe time are quite incongruent; and around all the nuclei of shared\\n\\'reality\\' floats the vast cloud of experiences that are wholly\\nsubjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not even an eventual\\nending for themselves in the perceptual world--the mere day-dreams and\\njoys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds. These exist WITH\\none another, indeed, and with the objective nuclei, but out of them it\\nis probable that to all eternity no inter-related system of any kind\\nwill ever be made.]\\n\\nWhosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even while\\nhe has it, may be said to have an experience that reaches beyond itself.\\nFrom inside of its own entity it says \\'more,\\' and postulates reality\\nexisting elsewhere. For the transcendentalist, who holds knowing to\\nconsist in a salto motale across an \\'epistemological chasm,\\' such an\\nidea presents no difficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might\\nbe inconsistent with an empiricism like our own. Have we not explained\\nthat conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of things\\nthat fall outside of the knowing experience itself--by intermediary\\nexperiences and by a terminus that fulfils?\\n\\nCan the knowledge be there before these elements that constitute its\\nbeing have come? And, if knowledge be not there, how can objective\\nreference occur?\\n\\nThe key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as\\nverified and completed, and the same knowing as in transit and on its\\nway. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is only when\\nour idea of the Hall has actually terminated in the percept that we know\\n\\'for certain\\' that from the beginning it was truly cognitive of THAT.\\nUntil established by the end of the process, its quality of knowing\\nthat, or indeed of knowing anything, could still be doubted; and yet\\nthe knowing really was there, as the result now shows. We were VIRTUAL\\nknowers of the Hall long before we were certified to have been its\\nactual knowers, by the percept\\'s retroactive validating power. Just\\nso we are \\'mortal\\' all the time, by reason of the virtuality of the\\ninevitable event which will make us so when it shall have come.\\n\\nNow the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this\\nvirtual stage. It never is completed or nailed down. I speak not merely\\nof our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or dissociated \\'ions,\\'\\nor of \\'ejects\\' like the contents of our neighbors\\' minds; I speak also\\nof ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble, but which\\nwe hold for true altho unterminated perceptually, because nothing says\\n\\'no\\' to us, and there is no contradicting truth in sight. TO CONTINUE\\nTHINKING UNCHALLENGED IS, NINETY-NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED, OUR\\nPRACTICAL SUBSTITUTE FOR KNOWING IN THE COMPLETED SENSE. As each\\nexperience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and we\\nnowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or fact,\\nwe commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure. We live, as\\nit, were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense\\nof a determinate direction in falling forward is all we cover of the\\nfuture of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should be\\nconscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out\\ncurve. Our experience, inter alia, is of variations of rate and of\\ndirection, and lives in these transitions more than in the journey\\'s\\nend. The experiences of tendency are sufficient to act upon--what more\\ncould we have DONE at those moments even if the later verification comes\\ncomplete?\\n\\nThis is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the\\nobjective reference which is so flagrant a character of our experiences\\ninvolves a chasm and a mortal leap. A positively conjunctive transition\\ninvolves neither chasm nor leap. Being the very original of what we\\nmean by continuity, it makes a continuum wherever it appears. Objective\\nreference is an incident of the fact that so much of our experience\\ncomes as an insufficient and consists of process and transition. Our\\nfields of experience have no more definite boundaries than have our\\nfields of view. Both are fringed forever by a MORE that continuously\\ndevelops, and that continuously supersedes them as life proceeds. The\\nrelations, generally speaking, are as real here as the terms are, and\\nthe only complaint of the transcendentalist\\'s with which I could at\\nall sympathize would be his charge that, by first making knowledge to\\nconsist in external relations as I have done, and by then confessing\\nthat nine-tenths of the time these are not actually but only virtually\\nthere, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole business, and\\npalmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine thing. Only the\\nadmission, such a critic might say, that our ideas are self-transcendent\\nand \\'true\\' already; in advance of the experiences that are to terminate\\nthem, can bring solidity back to knowledge in a world like this, in\\nwhich transitions and terminations are only by exception fulfilled.\\n\\nThis seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method.\\nWhat would the self-transcendency affirmed to exist in advance of\\nall experiential mediation or termination, be KNOWN-AS? What would it\\npractically result in for US, were it true?\\n\\nIt could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our\\nexpectations and practical tendencies into the right path; and the right\\npath here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to face (or\\ncan never get face to face, as in the case of ejects), would be the\\npath that led us into the object\\'s nearest neighborhood. Where direct\\nacquaintance is lacking, \\'knowledge about\\' is the next best thing, and\\nan acquaintance with what actually lies about the \\'object, and is most\\nclosely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-waves\\nand your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts will never\\nPERCTEPTUALLY terminate, but my concepts of them lead me to their very\\nbrink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which\\nare their really next effects.\\n\\nEven if our ideas did in themselves possess the postulated\\nself-transcendency, it would still remain true that their putting us\\ninto possession of such effects WOULD BE THE SOLE CASH-VALUE OF THE\\nSELF-TRANSCENDENCY FOR US. And this cash-value, it is needless to\\nsay, is verbatim et liberatim what our empiricist account pays in. On\\npragmatist principles therefore, a dispute over self-transcendency is a\\npure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective things self-transcendent\\nor the reverse, it makes no difference, so long as we don\\'t differ about\\nthe nature of that exalted virtue\\'s fruits--fruits for us, of course,\\nhumanistic fruits.\\n\\nThe transcendentalist believes his ideas to be self-transcendent only\\nbecause he finds that in fact they do bear fruits. Why need he quarrel\\nwith an account of knowledge that insists on naming this effect? Why not\\ntreat the working of the idea from next to next as the essence of its\\nself-transcendency? Why insist that knowing is a static relation out of\\ntime when it practically seems so much a function of our active life?\\nFor a thing to be valid, says Lotze, is the same as to make itself\\nvalid. When the whole universe seems only to be making itself valid and\\nto be still incomplete (else why its ceaseless changing?) why, of all\\nthings, should knowing be exempt? Why should it not be making itself\\nvalid like everything else? That some parts of it may be already valid\\nor verified beyond dispute; the empirical philosopher, of course, like\\nany one else, may always hope.\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE ESSENCE OF HUMANISM\\n\\n[Footnote: Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\\nScientific Methods, vol. ii. No. 5, March 2, 1905.]\\n\\nHumanism is a ferment that has \\'come to stay.\\' It is not a single\\nhypothesis or theorem, and it dwells on no new facts. It is rather a\\nslow shifting in the philosophic perspective, making things appear\\nas from a new centre of interest or point of sight. Some writers are\\nstrongly conscious of the shifting, others half unconscious, even though\\ntheir own vision may have undergone much change. The result is no small\\nconfusion in debate, the half-conscious humanists often taking part\\nagainst the radical ones, as if they wished to count upon the other\\nside. [Footnote: Professor Baldwin, for example. His address \\'Selective\\nThinking\\' (Psychological Review, January, 1898, reprinted in his volume,\\n\\'Development and Evolution\\') seems to me an unusually well written\\npragmatic manifesto. Nevertheless in \\'The Limits of Pragmatism\\' (ibid;\\nJanuary, 1904), he (much less clearly) joins in the attack.]\\n\\nIf humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective, it\\nis obvious that the whole scene of the philosophic stage will change\\nin some degree if humanism prevails. The emphasis of things, their\\nforeground and background distribution, their sizes and values, will not\\nkeep just the same. [Footnote: The ethical changes, it seems to me, are\\nbeautifully made evident in Professor Dewey\\'s series of articles, which\\nwill never get the attention they deserve till they are printed in a\\nbook. I mean: \\'The Significance of Emotions,\\' Psychological Review,\\nvol. ii, 13; \\'The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology,\\' ibid; iii, 357;\\n\\'Psychology and Social Practice,\\' ibid., vii, 105; \\'Interpretation\\nof Savage Mind,\\' ibid; ix, 2l7; \\'Green\\'s Theory of the Moral Motive,\\'\\nPhilosophical Review, vol. i, 593; \\'Self-realization as the Moral\\nIdeal,\\' ibid; ii, 652; \\'The Psychology of Effort,\\' ibid; vi, 43;\\n\\'The Evolutionary Method as Applied to Morality,\\' ibid; xi, 107,353;\\n\\'Evolution and Ethics,\\' Monist, vol. viii, 321; to mention only a few.]\\nIf such pervasive consequences be involved in humanism, it is clear that\\nno pains which philosophers may take, first in defining it, and then in\\nfurthering, checking, or steering its progress, will be thrown away.\\n\\nIt suffers badly at present from incomplete definition. Its most\\nsystematic advocates, Schiller and Dewey, have published fragmentary\\nprogrammes only; and its bearing on many vital philosophic problems has\\nnot been traced except by adversaries who, scenting heresies in advance,\\nhave showered blows on doctrines--subjectivism and scepticism, for\\nexample--that no good humanist finds it necessary to entertain. By their\\nstill greater reticences, the anti-humanists have, in turn, perplexed\\nthe humanists. Much of the controversy has involved the word \\'truth.\\'\\nIt is always good in debate to know your adversary\\'s point of view\\nauthentically. But the critics of humanism never define exactly what the\\nword \\'truth\\' signifies when they use it themselves. The humanists have\\nto guess at their view; and the result has doubtless been much beating\\nof the air. Add to all this, great individual differences in both camps,\\nand it becomes clear that nothing is so urgently needed, at the stage\\nwhich things have reached at present, as a sharper definition by each\\nside of its central point of view.\\n\\nWhoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make sure\\nof what\\'s what and who is who. Any one can contribute such a definition,\\nand, without it, no one knows exactly where he stands. If I offer my own\\nprovisional definition of humanism now and here, others may improve it,\\nsome adversary may be led to define his own creed more sharply by the\\ncontrast, and a certain quickening of the crystallization of general\\nopinion may result.\\n\\nThe essential service of humanism, as I conceive the situation, is to\\nhave seen that THO ONE PART OF OUR EXPERIENCE MAY LEAN UPON ANOTHER PART\\nTO MAKE IT WHAT IT IS IN ANY ONE OF SEVERAL ASPECTS IN WHICH IT MAY\\nBE CONSIDERED, EXPERIENCE AS A WHOLE IS SELF-CONTAINING AND LEANS\\nON NOTHING. Since this formula also expresses the main contention\\nof transcendental idealism, it needs abundant explication to make it\\nunambiguous. It seems, at first sight, to confine itself to denying\\ntheism and pantheism. But, in fact, it need not deny either; everything\\nwould depend on the exegesis; and if the formula ever became canonical,\\nit would certainly develop both right-wing and left-wing interpreters.\\nI myself read humanism theistically and pluralistically. If there be a\\nGod, he is no absolute all-experiencer, but simply the experiencer of\\nwidest actual conscious span. Read thus, humanism is for me a religion\\nsusceptible of reasoned defence, tho I am well aware how many minds\\nthere are to whom it can appeal religiously only when it has been\\nmonistically translated. Ethically the pluralistic form of it takes for\\nme a stronger hold on reality than any other philosophy I know of--it\\nbeing essentially a SOCIAL philosophy, a philosophy of \\'CO,\\' in which\\nconjunctions do the work. But my primary reason for advocating it is its\\nmatchless intellectual economy. It gets rid, not only of the standing\\n\\'problems\\' that monism engenders (\\'problem of evil,\\' \\'problem of\\nfreedom,\\' and the like), but of other metaphysical mysteries and\\nparadoxes as well.\\n\\nIt gets rid, for example, of the whole agnostic controversy, by refusing\\nto entertain the hypothesis of trans-empirical reality at all. It gets\\nrid of any need for an absolute of the bradleyan type (avowedly sterile\\nfor intellectual purposes) by insisting that the conjunctive relations\\nfound within experience are faultlessly real. It gets rid of the need\\nof an absolute of the roycean type (similarly sterile) by its pragmatic\\ntreatment of the problem of knowledge. As the views of knowledge,\\nreality and truth imputed to humanism have been those so far most\\nfiercely attacked, it is in regard to these ideas that a sharpening of\\nfocus seems most urgently required. I proceed therefore to bring the\\nviews which I impute to humanism in these respects into focus as briefly\\nas I can.\\n\\nII\\n\\nIf the central humanistic thesis, printed above in italics, be accepted,\\nit will follow that, if there be any such thing at all as knowing, the\\nknower and the object known must both be portions of experience. One\\npart of experience must, therefore, either\\n\\n(1) Know another part of experience--in other words, parts must, as\\nProfessor Woodbridge says, [Footnote: In Science, November 4, 1904, p.\\n599.] represent ONE ANOTHER instead of representing realities outside of\\n\\'consciousness\\'--this case is that of conceptual knowledge; or else\\n\\n(2) They must simply exist as so many ultimate THATS or facts of being,\\nin the first instance; and then, as a secondary complication, and\\nwithout doubling up its entitative singleness, any one and the same\\nTHAT in experience must figure alternately as a thing known and as a\\nknowledge of the thing, by reason of two divergent kinds of context into\\nwhich, in the general course of experience, it gets woven. [Footnote:\\nThis statement is probably excessively obscure to any one who has not\\nread my two articles \\'Does Consciousness Exist?\\' and \\'A World of Pure\\nExperience\\' in the Journal of Philosophy, vol. i, 1904.]\\n\\nThis second case is that of sense-perception. There is a stage of\\nthought that goes beyond common sense, and of it I shall say more\\npresently; but the common-sense stage is a perfectly definite\\nhalting-place of thought, primarily for purposes of action; and, so long\\nas we remain on the common-sense stage of thought, object and subject\\nFUSE in the fact of \\'presentation\\' or sense-perception-the pen and hand\\nwhich I now SEE writing, for example, ARE the physical realities which\\nthose words designate. In this case there is no self-transcendency\\nimplied in the knowing. Humanism, here, is only a more comminuted\\nIDENTITATSPHILOSOPHIE.\\n\\nIn case (1), on the contrary, the representative experience DOES\\nTRANSCEND ITSELF in knowing the other experience that is its object.\\nNo one can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without seeing\\nthem as numerically distinct entities, of which the one lies beyond the\\nother and away from it, along some direction and with some interval,\\nthat can be definitely named. But, if the talker be a humanist, he\\nmust also see this distance-interval concretely and pragmatically, and\\nconfess it to consist of other intervening experiences--of possible\\nones, at all events, if not of actual. To call my present idea of my\\ndog, for example, cognitive of the real dog means that, as the actual\\ntissue of experience is constituted, the idea is capable of leading into\\na chain of other experiences on my part that go from next to next and\\nterminate at last in vivid sense-perceptions of a jumping, barking,\\nhairy body. Those ARE the real dog, the dog\\'s full presence, for my\\ncommon sense. If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher, altho\\nthey may not BE the real dog for him, they MEAN the real dog, are\\npractical substitutes for the real dog, as the representation was a\\npractical substitute for them, that real dog being a lot of atoms,\\nsay, or of mind-stuff, that lie WHERE the sense-perceptions lie in his\\nexperience as well as in my own.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nThe philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes beyond\\nthe stage of common sense; and the difference is simply that he\\n\\'interpolates\\' and \\'extrapolates,\\' where common sense does not. For\\ncommon sense, two men see the same identical real dog. Philosophy,\\nnoting actual differences in their perceptions points out the duality\\nof these latter, and interpolates something between them as a more real\\nterminus--first, organs, viscera, etc.; next, cells; then, ultimate\\natoms; lastly, mind-stuff perhaps. The original sense-termini of the two\\nmen, instead of coalescing with each other and with the real dog-object,\\nas at first supposed, are thus held by philosophers to be separated by\\ninvisible realities with which, at most, they are conterminous.\\n\\nAbolish, now, one of the percipients, and the interpolation changes\\ninto \\'extrapolation.\\' The sense-terminus of the remaining percipient is\\nregarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching reality. He has only\\ncarried the procession of experiences, the philosopher thinks, to a\\ndefinite, because practical, halting-place somewhere on the way towards\\nan absolute truth that lies beyond.\\n\\nThe humanist sees all the time, however, that there is no absolute\\ntranscendency even about the more absolute realities thus conjectured or\\nbelieved in. The viscera and cells are only possible percepts following\\nupon that of the outer body. The atoms again, tho we may never attain\\nto human means of perceiving them, are still defined perceptually.\\nThe mind-stuff itself is conceived as a kind of experience; and it is\\npossible to frame the hypothesis (such hypotheses can by no logic be\\nexcluded from philosophy) of two knowers of a piece of mind-stuff and\\nthe mind-stuff itself becoming \\'confluent\\' at the moment at which our\\nimperfect knowing might pass into knowing of a completed type. Even so\\ndo you and I habitually conceive our two perceptions and the real dog\\nas confluent, tho only provisionally, and for the common-sense stage\\nof thought. If my pen be inwardly made of mind-stuff, there is no\\nconfluence NOW between that mind-stuff and my visual perception of the\\npen. But conceivably there might come to be such confluence; for, in\\nthe case of my HAND, the visual sensations and the inward feelings of\\nthe hand, its mind-stuff, so to speak, are even now as confluent as any\\ntwo things can be.\\n\\nThere is, thus, no breach in humanistic epistemology. Whether knowledge\\nbe taken as ideally perfected, or only as true enough to pass muster\\nfor practice, it is hung on one continuous scheme. Reality, howsoever\\nremote, is always defined as a terminus within the general possibilities\\nof experience; and what knows it is defined as an experience THAT\\n\\'REPRESENTS\\' IT, IN THE SENSE OF BEING SUBSTITUTABLE FOR IT IN OUR\\nTHINKING because it leads to the same associates, OR IN THE SENSE\\nOF \\'POINTING TO IT THROUGH A CHAIN OF OTHER EXPERIENCES THAT EITHER\\nINTERVENE OR MAY INTERVENE.\\n\\nAbsolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as sensation\\nbears to conception or imagination. Both are provisional or final\\ntermini, sensation being only the terminus at which the practical man\\nhabitually stops, while the philosopher projects a \\'beyond,\\' in the\\nshape of more absolute reality. These termini, for the practical and the\\nphilosophical stages of thought respectively, are self-supporting. They\\nare not \\'true\\' of anything else, they simply ARE, are REAL. They \\'lean\\non nothing,\\' as my italicized formula said. Rather does the whole\\nfabric of experience lean on them, just as the whole fabric of the\\nsolar system, including many relative positions, leans, for its absolute\\nposition in space, on any one of its constituent stars. Here, again, one\\ngets a new IDENTITATSPHILOSOPHIE in pluralistic form.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nIf I have succeeded in making this at all clear (tho I fear that brevity\\nand abstractness between them may have made me fail), the reader\\nwill see that the \\'truth\\' of our mental operations must always be an\\nintra-experiential affair. A conception is reckoned true by common sense\\nwhen it can be made to lead to a sensation. The sensation, which\\nfor common sense is not so much \\'true\\' as \\'real,\\' is held to be\\nPROVISIONALLY true by the philosopher just in so far as it COVERS (abuts\\nat, or occupies the place of) a still more absolutely real experience,\\nin the possibility of which, to some remoter experient, the philosopher\\nfinds reason to believe.\\n\\nMeanwhile what actually DOES count for true to any individual trower,\\nwhether he be philosopher or common man, is always a result of his\\nAPPERCEPTIONS. If a novel experience, conceptual or sensible, contradict\\ntoo emphatically our pre-existent system of beliefs, in ninety-nine\\ncases out of a hundred it is treated as false. Only when the older and\\nthe newer experiences are congruous enough to mutually apperceive and\\nmodify each other, does what we treat as an advance in truth result.\\nIn no case, however, need truth consist in a relation between our\\nexperiences and something archetypal or trans-experiential. Should we\\never reach absolutely terminal experiences, experiences in which we all\\nagreed, which were superseded by no revised continuations, these would\\nnot be TRUE, they would be REAL, they would simply BE, and be indeed\\nthe angles, corners, and linchpins of all reality, on which the truth of\\neverything else would be stayed. Only such OTHER things as led to these\\nby satisfactory conjunctions would be \\'true.\\' Satisfactory connection of\\nsome sort with such termini is all that the word \\'truth\\' means. On the\\ncommon-stage of thought sense-presentations serve as such termini. Our\\nideas and concepts and scientific theories pass for true only so far as\\nthey harmoniously lead back to the world of sense.\\n\\nI hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to trace\\nthe more essential features of that way of viewing things. I feel almost\\ncertain that Messrs. Dewey and Schiller will do so. If the attackers\\nwill also take some slight account of it, it may be that discussion will\\nbe a little less wide of the mark than it has hitherto been.\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nA WORD MORE ABOUT TRUTH\\n\\n[Footnote: Reprint from the Journal of Philosophy, July 18,1907.]\\n\\nMy failure in making converts to my conception of truth seems, if I\\nmay judge by what I hear in conversation, almost complete. An ordinary\\nphilosopher would feel disheartened, and a common choleric sinner would\\ncurse God and die, after such a reception. But instead of taking counsel\\nof despair, I make bold to vary my statements, in the faint hope that\\nrepeated droppings may wear upon the stone, and that my formulas may\\nseem less obscure if surrounded by something more of a \\'mass\\' whereby to\\napperceive them.\\n\\nFor fear of compromising other pragmatists, whoe\\'er they be, I will\\nspeak of the conception which I am trying to make intelligible, as my\\nown conception. I first published it in the year 1885, in the first\\narticle reprinted in the present book. Essential theses of this article\\nwere independently supported in 1893 and 1895 by Professor D. S. Miller\\n[Footnote: Philosophical Review, vol. ii, p. 408, and Psychological\\nReview, vol. ii, p. 533.] and were repeated by me in a presidential\\naddress on \\'The knowing of things together\\' [Footnote: The relevant\\nparts of which are printed above, p. 43.] in 1895. Professor Strong,\\nin an article in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., [Footnote: Vol. i,\\np. 253.] entitled \\'A naturalistic theory of the reference of thought\\nto reality,\\' called our account \\'the James-Miller theory of cognition,\\'\\nand, as I understood him, gave it his adhesion. Yet, such is the\\ndifficulty of writing clearly in these penetralia of philosophy, that\\neach of these revered colleagues informs me privately that the account\\nof truth I now give--which to me is but that earlier statement more\\ncompletely set forth--is to him inadequate, and seems to leave the gist\\nof real cognition out. If such near friends disagree, what can I hope\\nfrom remoter ones, and what from unfriendly critics?\\n\\nYet I feel so sure that the fault must lie in my lame forms of statement\\nand not in my doctrine, that I am fain to try once more to express\\nmyself.\\n\\nAre there not some general distinctions which it may help us to agree\\nabout in advance? Professor Strong distinguishes between what he calls\\n\\'saltatory\\' and what he calls \\'ambulatory\\' relations. \\'Difference,\\' for\\nexample, is saltatory, jumping as it were immediately from one term\\nto another, but \\'distance\\' in time or space is made out of intervening\\nparts of experience through which we ambulate in succession. Years ago,\\nwhen T. H. Green\\'s ideas were most influential, I was much troubled\\nby his criticisms of english sensationalism. One of his disciples in\\nparticular would always say to me, \\'Yes! TERMS may indeed be possibly\\nsensational in origin; but RELATIONS, what are they but pure acts of\\nthe intellect coming upon the sensations from above, and of a higher\\nnature?\\' I well remember the sudden relief it gave me to perceive one\\nday that SPACE-relations at any rate were homogeneous with the terms\\nbetween which they mediated. The terms were spaces, and the relations\\nwere other intervening spaces. [Footnote: See my Principles of\\nPsychology, vol. ii, pp. 148-153.] For the Greenites space-relations had\\nbeen saltatory, for me they became thenceforward ambulatory.\\n\\nNow the most general way of contrasting my view of knowledge with the\\npopular view (which is also the view of most epistemologists) is to call\\nmy view ambulatory, and the other view saltatory; and the most general\\nway of characterizing the two views is by saying that my view describes\\nknowing as it exists concretely, while the other view only describes its\\nresults abstractly taken.\\n\\nI fear that most of my recalcitrant readers fail to recognize that what\\nis ambulatory in the concrete may be taken so abstractly as to appear\\nsaltatory. Distance, for example, is made abstract by emptying out\\nwhatever is particular in the concrete intervals--it is reduced thus\\nto a sole \\'difference,\\' a difference of \\'place,\\' which is a logical or\\nsaltatory distinction, a so-called \\'pure relation.\\'\\n\\nThe same is true of the relation called \\'knowing,\\' which may connect\\nan idea with a reality. My own account of this relation is ambulatory\\nthrough and through. I say that we know an object by means of an idea,\\nwhenever we ambulate towards the object under the impulse which the idea\\ncommunicates. If we believe in so-called \\'sensible\\' realities, the idea\\nmay not only send us towards its object, but may put the latter into our\\nvery hand, make it our immediate sensation. But, if, as most reflective\\npeople opine, sensible realities are not \\'real\\' realities, but only\\ntheir appearances, our idea brings us at least so far, puts us in touch\\nwith reality\\'s most authentic appearances and substitutes. In any case\\nour idea brings us into the object\\'s neighborhood, practical or ideal,\\ngets us into commerce with it, helps us towards its closer acquaintance,\\nenables us to foresee it, class it, compare it, deduce it,--in short, to\\ndeal with it as we could not were the idea not in our possession.\\n\\nThe idea is thus, when functionally considered, an instrument for\\nenabling us the better to HAVE TO DO with the object and to act about\\nit. But it and the object are both of them bits of the general sheet\\nand tissue of reality at large; and when we say that the idea leads us\\ntowards the object, that only means that it carries us forward\\nthrough intervening tracts of that reality into the object\\'s closer\\nneighborhood, into the midst of its associates at least, be these its\\nphysical neighbors, or be they its logical congeners only. Thus carried\\ninto closer quarters, we are in an improved situation as regards\\nacquaintance and conduct; and we say that through the idea we now KNOW\\nthe object better or more truly.\\n\\nMy thesis is that the knowing here is MADE by the ambulation through the\\nintervening experiences. If the idea led us nowhere, or FROM that object\\ninstead of towards it, could we talk at all of its having any cognitive\\nquality? Surely not, for it is only when taken in conjunction with the\\nintermediate experiences that it gets related to THAT PARTICULAR OBJECT\\nrather than to any other part of nature. Those intermediaries determine\\nwhat particular knowing function it exerts. The terminus they guide\\nus to tells us what object it \\'means,\\' the results they enrich us\\nwith \\'verify\\' or \\'refute\\' it. Intervening experiences are thus as\\nindispensable foundations for a concrete relation of cognition as\\nintervening space is for a relation of distance. Cognition, whenever\\nwe take it concretely, means determinate \\'ambulation,\\' through\\nintermediaries, from a terminus a quo to, or towards, a terminus ad\\nquem. As the intermediaries are other than the termini, and connected\\nwith them by the usual associative bonds (be these \\'external\\' or be they\\nlogical, i.e., classificatory, in character), there would appear to\\nbe nothing especially unique about the processes of knowing. They fall\\nwholly within experience; and we need use, in describing them, no\\nother categories than those which we employ in describing other natural\\nprocesses.\\n\\nBut there exist no processes which we cannot also consider abstractly,\\neviscerating them down to their essential skeletons or outlines; and\\nwhen we have treated the processes of knowing thus, we are easily led to\\nregard them as something altogether unparalleled in nature. For we first\\nempty idea, object and intermediaries of all their particularities, in\\norder to retain only a general scheme, and then we consider the latter\\nonly in its function of giving a result, and not in its character of\\nbeing a process. In this treatment the intermediaries shrivel into the\\nform of a mere space of separation, while the idea and object retain\\nonly the logical distinctness of being the end-terms that are separated.\\nIn other words, the intermediaries which in their concrete particularity\\nform a bridge, evaporate ideally into an empty interval to cross, and\\nthen, the relation of the end-terms having become saltatory, the whole\\nhocus-pocus of Erkenntnistheorie begins, and goes on unrestrained\\nby further concrete considerations. The idea, in \\'meaning\\' an object\\nseparated by an \\'epistemological chasm\\' from itself, now executes what\\nProfessor Ladd calls a \\'salto mortale\\'; in knowing the object\\'s nature,\\nit now \\'transcends\\' its own. The object in turn becomes \\'present\\' where\\nit is really absent, etc.; until a scheme remains upon our hands, the\\nsublime paradoxes of which some of us think that nothing short of an\\n\\'absolute\\' can explain.\\n\\nThe relation between idea and object, thus made abstract and saltatory,\\nis thenceforward opposed, as being more essential and previous, to its\\nown ambulatory self, and the more concrete description is branded as\\neither false or insufficient. The bridge of intermediaries, actual\\nor possible, which in every real case is what carries and defines the\\nknowing, gets treated as an episodic complication which need not even\\npotentially be there. I believe that this vulgar fallacy of opposing\\nabstractions to the concretes from which they are abstracted, is the\\nmain reason why my account of knowing is deemed so unsatisfactory, and I\\nwill therefore say a word more on that general point.\\n\\nAny vehicle of conjunction, if all its particularities are abstracted\\nfrom it, will leave us with nothing on our hands but the original\\ndisjunction which it bridged over. But to escape treating the resultant\\nself-contradiction as an achievement of dialectical profundity, all we\\nneed is to restore some part, no matter how small, of what we have taken\\naway. In the case of the epistemological chasm the first reasonable step\\nis to remember that the chasm was filled with SOME empirical material,\\nwhether ideational or sensational, which performed SOME bridging\\nfunction and saved us from the mortal leap. Restoring thus the\\nindispensable modicum of reality to the matter of our discussion, we\\nfind our abstract treatment genuinely useful. We escape entanglement\\nwith special cases without at the same time falling into gratuitous\\nparadoxes. We can now describe the general features of cognition, tell\\nwhat on the whole it DOES FOR US, in a universal way.\\n\\nWe must remember that this whole inquiry into knowing grows up on a\\nreflective level. In any real moment of knowing, what we are thinking of\\nis our object, not the way in which we ourselves are momentarily knowing\\nit. We at this moment, as it happens, have knowing itself for our\\nobject; but I think that the reader will agree that his present knowing\\nof that object is included only abstractly, and by anticipation, in\\nthe results he may reach. What he concretely has before his mind, as he\\nreasons, is some supposed objective instance of knowing, as he conceives\\nit to go on in some other person, or recalls it from his own past. As\\nsuch, he, the critic, sees it to contain both an idea and an object, and\\nprocesses by which the knower is guided from the one towards the other.\\nHe sees that the idea is remote from the object, and that, whether\\nthrough intermediaries or not, it genuinely HAS TO DO with it. He sees\\nthat it thus works beyond its immediate being, and lays hold of a\\nremote reality; it jumps across, transcends itself. It does all this by\\nextraneous aid, to be sure, but when the aid has come, it HAS done it\\nand the result is secure. Why not talk of results by themselves, then,\\nwithout considering means? Why not treat the idea as simply grasping\\nor intuiting the reality, of its having the faculty anyhow, of shooting\\nover nature behind the scenes and knowing things immediately and\\ndirectly? Why need we always lug in the bridging?--it only retards our\\ndiscourse to do so.\\n\\nSuch abstract talk about cognition\\'s results is surely convenient; and\\nit is surely as legitimate as it is convenient, SO LONG AS WE DO NOT\\nFORGET OR POSITIVELY DENY, WHAT IT IGNORES. We may on occasion say\\nthat our idea meant ALWAYS that particular object, that it led us there\\nbecause it was OF it intrinsically and essentially. We may insist that\\nits verification follows upon that original cognitive virtue in it--and\\nall the rest--and we shall do no harm so long as we know that these are\\nonly short cuts in our thinking. They are positively true accounts of\\nfact AS FAR AS THEY GO, only they leave vast tracts of fact out of the\\naccount, tracts of tact that have to be reinstated to make the accounts\\nliterally true of any real case. But if, not merely passively ignoring\\nthe intermediaries, you actively deny them [Footnote: This is the\\nfallacy which I have called \\'vicious intellectualism\\' in my book A\\nPluralistic Universe, Longmans, Green & Co., 1909.] to be even potential\\nrequisites for the results you are so struck by, your epistemology goes\\nto irremediable smash. You are as far off the track as an historian\\nwould be, if, lost in admiration of Napoleon\\'s personal power, he were\\nto ignore his marshals and his armies, and were to accuse you of\\nerror in describing his conquests as effected by their means. Of such\\nabstractness and one-sidedness I accuse most of the critics of my own\\naccount.\\n\\nIn the second lecture of the book Pragmatism, I used the illustration\\nof a squirrel scrambling round a tree-trunk to keep out of sight of\\na pursuing man: both go round the tree, but does the man go round the\\nsquirrel? It all depends, I said, on what you mean by going round.\\' In\\none sense of the word the man \\'goes round,\\' in another sense he does\\nnot. I settled the dispute by pragmatically distinguishing the senses.\\nBut I told how some disputants had called my distinction a shuffling\\nevasion and taken their stand on what they called \\'plain honest English\\ngoing-round.\\'\\n\\nIn such a simple case few people would object to letting the term in\\ndispute be translated into its concreter equivalents. But in the case\\nof a complex function like our knowing they act differently. I give full\\nconcrete particular value for the ideas of knowing in every case I can\\nthink of, yet my critics insist that \\'plain honest English knowing\\' is\\nleft out of my account. They write as if the minus were on my side and\\nthe plus on theirs.\\n\\nThe essence of the matter for me is that altho knowing can be both\\nabstractly and concretely described, and altho the abstract descriptions\\nare often useful enough, yet they are all sucked up and absorbed without\\nresiduum into the concreter ones, and contain nothing of any essentially\\nother or higher nature, which the concrete descriptions can be justly\\naccused of leaving behind. Knowing is just a natural process like any\\nother. There is no ambulatory process whatsoever, the results of which\\nwe may not describe, if we prefer to, in saltatory terms, or represent\\nin static formulation. Suppose, e.g., that we say a man is \\'prudent.\\'\\nConcretely, that means that he takes out insurance, hedges in betting,\\nlooks before he leaps. Do such acts CONSTITUTE the prudence? ARE they\\nthe man qua prudent?\\n\\nOr is the prudence something by itself and independent of them? As a\\nconstant habit in him, a permanent tone of character, it is convenient\\nto call him prudent in abstraction from any one of his acts, prudent in\\ngeneral and without specification, and to say the acts follow from the\\npre-existing prudence. There are peculiarities in his psycho-physical\\nsystem that make him act prudently; and there are tendencies to\\nassociation in our thoughts that prompt some of them to make for truth\\nand others for error. But would the man be prudent in the absence of\\neach and all of the acts? Or would the thoughts be true if they had no\\nassociative or impulsive tendencies? Surely we have no right to oppose\\nstatic essences in this way to the moving processes in which they live\\nembedded.\\n\\nMy bedroom is above my library. Does the \\'aboveness\\' here mean\\naught that is different from the concrete spaces which have to be\\nmoved-through in getting from the one to the other? It means, you may\\nsay, a pure topographic relation, a sort of architect\\'s plan among the\\neternal essences. But that is not the full aboveness, it is only an\\nabbreviated substitute that on occasion may lead my mind towards truer,\\ni.e., fuller, dealings with the real aboveness. It is not an aboveness\\nante rem, it is a post rem extract from the aboveness in rebus. We\\nmay indeed talk, for certain conveniences, as if the abstract scheme\\npreceded, we may say \\'I must go up stairs because of the essential\\naboveness,\\' just as we may say that the man \\'does prudent acts because\\nof his ingrained prudence,\\' or that our ideas \\'lead us truly because of\\ntheir intrinsic truth.\\' But this should not debar us on other occasions\\nfrom using completer forms of description. A concrete matter of fact\\nalways remains identical under any form of description, as when we say\\nof a line, now that it runs from left to right, and now that it runs\\nfrom right to left. These are but names of one and the same fact, one\\nmore expedient to use at one time, one at another. The full facts of\\ncognition, whatever be the way in which we talk about them, even when\\nwe talk most abstractly, stand inalterably given in the actualities and\\npossibilities of the experience-continuum. [Footnote 1: The ultimate\\nobject or terminus of a cognitive process may in certain instances lie\\nbeyond the direct experience of the particular cognizer, but it, of\\ncourse, must exist as part of the total universe of experience whose\\nconstitution, with cognition in it, the critic is discussing.] But my\\ncritics treat my own more concrete talk as if IT were the kind that\\nsinned by its inadequacy, and as if the full continuum left something\\nout.\\n\\nA favorite way of opposing the more abstract to the more concrete\\naccount is to accuse those who favor the latter of \\'confounding\\npsychology with logic.\\' Our critics say that when we are asked what\\ntruth MEANS, we reply by telling only how it is ARRIVED-AT. But since a\\nmeaning is a logical relation, static, independent of time, how can it\\npossibly be identified, they say, with any concrete man\\'s experience,\\nperishing as this does at the instant of its production? This, indeed,\\nsounds profound, but I challenge the profundity. I defy any one to show\\nany difference between logic and psychology here. The logical relation\\nstands to the psychological relation between idea and object only as\\nsaltatory abstractness stands to ambulatory concreteness. Both relations\\nneed a psychological vehicle; and the \\'logical\\' one is simply the\\n\\'psychological\\' one disemboweled of its fulness, and reduced to a bare\\nabstractional scheme.\\n\\nA while ago a prisoner, on being released, tried to assassinate the\\njudge who had sentenced him. He had apparently succeeded in conceiving\\nthe judge timelessly, had reduced him to a bare logical meaning, that\\nof being his \\'enemy and persecutor,\\' by stripping off all the concrete\\nconditions (as jury\\'s verdict, official obligation, absence of personal\\nspite, possibly sympathy) that gave its full psychological character to\\nthe sentence as a particular man\\'s act in time. Truly the sentence WAS\\ninimical to the culprit; but which idea of it is the truer one, that\\nbare logical definition of it, or its full psychological specification?\\nThe anti-pragmatists ought in consistency to stand up for the criminal\\'s\\nview of the case, treat the judge as the latter\\'s logical enemy, and bar\\nout the other conditions as so much inessential psychological stuff.\\n\\nII\\n\\nA still further obstacle, I suspect, stands in the way of my account\\'s\\nacceptance. Like Dewey and like Schiller, I have had to say that\\nthe truth of an idea is determined by its satisfactoriness. But\\nsatisfactoriness is a subjective term, just as idea is; and truth\\nis generally regarded as \\'objective.\\' Readers who admit that\\nsatisfactoriness is our only MARK of truth, the only sign that we\\npossess the precious article, will still say that the objective relation\\nbetween idea and object which the word \\'truth\\' points to is left out of\\nmy account altogether. I fear also that the association of my poor name\\nwith the \\'will to believe\\' (which \\'will,\\' it seems to me, ought to play\\nno part in this discussion) works against my credit in some quarters.\\nI fornicate with that unclean thing, my adversaries may think, whereas\\nyour genuine truth-lover must discourse in huxleyan heroics, and feel as\\nif truth, to be real truth, ought to bring eventual messages of death to\\nall our satisfactions. Such divergences certainly prove the complexity\\nof the area of our discussion; but to my mind they also are based on\\nmisunderstandings, which (tho with but little hope of success) I will\\ntry to diminish by a further word of explanation.\\n\\nFirst, then, I will ask my objectors to define exactly what SORT of\\nthing it is they have in mind when they speak of a truth that shall be\\nabsolute, complete and objective; and then I will defy them to show me\\nany conceivable standing-room for such a kind of truth outside the terms\\nof my own description. It will fall, as I contend, entirely within the\\nfield of my analysis.\\n\\nTo begin with, it must obtain between an idea and a reality that is the\\nidea\\'s object; and, as a predicate, it must apply to the idea and not\\nto the object, for objective realities are not TRUE, at least not in the\\nuniverse of discourse to which we are now confining ourselves, for there\\nthey are taken as simply BEING, while the ideas are true OF them. But we\\ncan suppose a series of ideas to be successively more and more true\\nof the same object, and can ask what is the extreme approach to being\\nabsolutely true that the last idea might attain to.\\n\\nThe maximal conceivable truth in an idea would seem to be that it should\\nlead to an actual merging of ourselves with the object, to an utter\\nmutual confluence and identification. On the common-sense level\\nof belief this is what is supposed really to take place in\\nsense-perception. My idea of this pen verifies itself through\\nmy percept; and my percept is held to BE the pen for the time\\nbeing--percepts and physical realities being treated by common sense as\\nidentical. But the physiology of the senses has criticised common sense\\nout of court, and the pen \\'in itself\\' is now believed to lie beyond my\\nmomentary percept. Yet the notion once suggested, of what a completely\\nconsummated acquaintance with a reality might be like, remains over for\\nour speculative purposes. TOTAL CONFLUX OF THE MIND WITH THE REALITY\\nwould be the absolute limit of truth, there could be no better or more\\nsatisfying knowledge than that.\\n\\nSuch total conflux, it is needless to say, is ALREADY EXPLICITLY\\nPROVIDED FOR, AS A POSSIBILITY, IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER. If an idea\\nshould ever lead us not only TOWARDS, or UP TO, or AGAINST, a reality,\\nbut so close that we and the reality should MELT TOGETHER, it would be\\nmade absolutely true, according to me, by that performance.\\n\\nIn point of fact philosophers doubt that this ever occurs. What happens,\\nthey think, is only that we get nearer and nearer to realities,\\nwe approximate more and more to the all-satisfying limit; and the\\ndefinition of actually, as distinguished from imaginably, complete and\\nobjective truth, can then only be that it belongs to the idea that\\nwill lead us as CLOSE UP AGAINST THE OBJECT as in the nature of our\\nexperience is possible, literally NEXT to it, for instance.\\n\\nSuppose, now, there were an idea that did this for a certain objective\\nreality. Suppose that no further approach were possible, that nothing\\nlay between, that the next step would carry us right INTO the reality;\\nthen that result, being the next thing to conflux, would make the idea\\ntrue in the maximal degree that might be supposed practically attainable\\nin the world which we inhabit.\\n\\nWell, I need hardly explain that THAT DEGREE OF TRUTH IS ALSO PROVIDED\\nFOR IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER. And if satisfactions are the marks of\\ntruth\\'s presence, we may add that any less true substitute for such a\\ntrue idea would prove less satisfactory. Following its lead, we should\\nprobably find out that we did not quite touch the terminus. We should\\ndesiderate a closer approach, and not rest till we had found it.\\n\\nI am, of course, postulating here a standing reality independent of the\\nidea that knows it. I am also postulating that satisfactions grow pari\\npassu with our approximation to such reality. [Footnote 1: Say, if\\nyou prefer to, that DISsatisfactions decrease pari passu with\\nsuch approximation. The approximation may be of any kind\\nassignable--approximation in time or in space, or approximation in kind,\\nwhich in common speech means \\'copying.\\'] If my critics challenge this\\nlatter assumption, I retort upon them with the former. Our whole notion\\nof a standing reality grows up in the form of an ideal limit to the\\nseries of successive termini to which our thoughts have led us and\\nstill are leading us. Each terminus proves provisional by leaving us\\nunsatisfied. The truer idea is the one that pushes farther; so we\\nare ever beckoned on by the ideal notion of an ultimate completely\\nsatisfactory terminus. I, for one, obey and accept that notion. I can\\nconceive no other objective CONTENT to the notion of ideally perfect\\ntruth than that of penetration into such a terminus, nor can I conceive\\nthat the notion would ever have grown up, or that true ideas would ever\\nhave been sorted out from false or idle ones, save for the greater\\nsum of satisfactions, intellectual or practical, which the truer ones\\nbrought with them. Can we imagine a man absolutely satisfied with an\\nidea and with all its relations to his other ideas and to his sensible\\nexperiences, who should yet not take its content as a true account of\\nreality? The matter of the true is thus absolutely identical with the\\nmatter of the satisfactory. You may put either word first in your ways\\nof talking; but leave out that whole notion of SATISFACTORY WORKING or\\nLEADING (which is the essence of my pragmatistic account) and call truth\\na static logical relation, independent even of POSSIBLE leadings or\\nsatisfactions, and it seems to me you cut all ground from under you.\\n\\nI fear that I am still very obscure. But I respectfully implore those\\nwho reject my doctrine because they can make nothing of my stumbling\\nlanguage, to tell us in their own name--und zwar very concretely and\\narticulately!--just how the real, genuine and absolutely \\'objective\\'\\ntruth which they believe in so profoundly, is constituted and\\nestablished. They mustn\\'t point to the \\'reality\\' itself, for truth is\\nonly our subjective relation to realities. What is the nominal\\nessence of this relation, its logical definition, whether or not it be\\n\\'objectively\\' attainable by mortals?\\n\\nWhatever they may say it is, I have the firmest faith that my account\\nwill prove to have allowed for it and included it by anticipation, as\\none possible case in the total mixture of cases. There is, in short,\\nno ROOM for any grade or sort of truth outside of the framework of\\nthe pragmatic system, outside of that jungle of empirical workings and\\nleadings, and their nearer or ulterior terminations, of which I seem to\\nhave written so unskilfully.\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nPROFESSOR PRATT ON TRUTH\\n\\nI\\n\\n[Footnote: Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, etc., August 15,\\n1907 (vol. iv, p. 464).]\\n\\nProfessor J. B. Pratt\\'s paper in the Journal of Philosophy for June 6,\\n1907, is so brilliantly written that its misconception of the pragmatist\\nposition seems doubly to call for a reply.\\n\\nHe asserts that, for a pragmatist, truth cannot be a relation between\\nan idea and a reality outside and transcendent of the idea, but must\\nlie \\'altogether within experience,\\' where it will need \\'no reference to\\nanything else to justify it\\'--no reference to the object, apparently.\\nThe pragmatist must \\'reduce everything to psychology,\\' aye, and to the\\npsychology of the immediate moment. He is consequently debarred from\\nsaying that an idea that eventually gets psychologically verified WAS\\nalready true before the process of verifying was complete; and he is\\nequally debarred from treating an idea as true provisionally so long as\\nhe only believes that he CAN verify it whenever he will.\\n\\nWhether such a pragmatist as this exists, I know not, never having\\nmyself met with the beast. We can define terms as we like; and if that\\nbe my friend Pratt\\'s definition of a pragmatist, I can only concur with\\nhis anti-pragmatism. But, in setting up the weird type, he quotes words\\nfrom me; so, in order to escape being classed by some reader along with\\nso asinine a being, I will reassert my own view of truth once more.\\n\\nTruth is essentially a relation between two things, an idea, on the one\\nhand, and a reality outside of the idea, on the other. This relation,\\nlike all relations, has its fundamentum, namely, the matrix of\\nexperiential circumstance, psychological as well as physical, in which\\nthe correlated terms are found embedded. In the case of the relation\\nbetween \\'heir\\' and \\'legacy\\' the fundamentum is a world in which there\\nwas a testator, and in which there is now a will and an executor; in the\\ncase of that between idea and object, it is a world with circumstances\\nof a sort to make a satisfactory verification process, lying around\\nand between the two terms. But just as a man may be called an heir and\\ntreated as one before the executor has divided the estate, so an idea\\nmay practically be credited with truth before the verification process\\nhas been exhaustively carried out--the existence of the mass of\\nverifying circumstance is enough. Where potentiality counts for\\nactuality in so many other cases, one does not see why it may not so\\ncount here. We call a man benevolent not only for his kind acts paid in,\\nbut for his readiness to perform others; we treat an idea as \\'luminous\\'\\nnot only for the light it has shed, but for that we expect it will\\nshed on dark problems. Why should we not equally trust the truth of our\\nideas? We live on credits everywhere; and we use our ideas far oftener\\nfor calling up things connected with their immediate objects, than for\\ncalling up those objects themselves. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred\\nthe only use we should make of the object itself, if we were led up to\\nit by our idea, would be to pass on to those connected things by its\\nmeans. So we continually curtail verification-processes, letting our\\nbelief that they are possible suffice.\\n\\nWhat CONSTITUTES THE RELATION known as truth, I now say, is just the\\nEXISTENCE IN THE EMPIRICAL WORLD OF THIS FUNDAMENTUM OF CIRCUMSTANCE\\nSURROUNDING OBJECT AND IDEA and ready to be either short-circuited\\nor traversed at full length. So long as it exists, and a satisfactory\\npassage through it between the object and the idea is possible, that\\nidea will both BE true, and will HAVE BEEN true of that object, whether\\nfully developed verification has taken place or not. The nature and\\nplace and affinities of the object of course play as vital a part in\\nmaking the particular passage possible as do the nature and associative\\ntendencies of the idea; so that the notion that truth could fall\\naltogether inside of the thinker\\'s private experience and be something\\npurely psychological, is absurd. It is BETWEEN the idea and the object\\nthat the truth-relation is to be sought and it involves both terms.\\n\\nBut the \\'intellectualistic\\' position, if I understand Mr. Pratt rightly,\\nis that, altho we can use this fundamentum, this mass of go-between\\nexperience, for TESTING truth, yet the truth-relation in itself remains\\nas something apart. It means, in Mr. Pratt\\'s words, merely \\'THIS SIMPLE\\nTHING THAT THE OBJECT OF WHICH ONE IS THINKING IS AS ONE THINKS IT.\\'\\n\\nIt seems to me that the word \\'as,\\' which qualifies the relation here,\\nand bears the whole \\'epistemological\\' burden, is anything but simple.\\nWhat it most immediately suggests is that the idea should be LIKE the\\nobject; but most of our ideas, being abstract concepts, bear almost no\\nresemblance to their objects. The \\'as\\' must therefore, I should say, be\\nusually interpreted functionally, as meaning that the idea shall lead\\nus into the same quarters of experience AS the object would. Experience\\nleads ever on and on, and objects and our ideas of objects may both\\nlead to the same goals. The ideas being in that case shorter cuts, we\\nSUBSTITUTE them more and more for their objects; and we habitually waive\\ndirect verification of each one of them, as their train passes through\\nour mind, because if an idea leads AS the object would lead, we can say,\\nin Mr. Pratt\\'s words, that in so far forth the object is AS we think it,\\nand that the idea, verified thus in so far forth, is true enough.\\n\\nMr. Pratt will undoubtedly accept most of these facts, but he will deny\\nthat they spell pragmatism. Of course, definitions are free to every\\none; but I have myself never meant by the pragmatic view of truth\\nanything different from what I now describe; and inasmuch as my use of\\nthe term came earlier than my friend\\'s, I think it ought to have the\\nright of way. But I suspect that Professor Pratt\\'s contention is not\\nsolely as to what one must think in order to be called a pragmatist. I\\nam cure that he believes that the truth-relation has something MORE in\\nit than the fundamentum which I assign can account for. Useful to\\ntest truth by, the matrix of circumstance, he thinks, cannot found the\\ntruth-relation in se, for that is trans-empirical and \\'saltatory.\\'\\n\\nWell, take an object and an idea, and assume that the latter is true of\\nthe former--as eternally and absolutely true as you like. Let the object\\nbe as much \\'as\\' the idea thinks it, as it is possible for one thing to\\nbe \\'as\\' another. I now formally ask of Professor Pratt to tell what this\\n\\'as\\'-ness in itself CONSISTS in--for it seems to me that it ought to\\nconsist in something assignable and describable, and not remain a pure\\nmystery, and I promise that if he can assign any determination of it\\nwhatever which I cannot successfully refer to some specification of what\\nin this article I have called the empirical fundamentum, I will confess\\nmy stupidity cheerfully, and will agree never to publish a line upon\\nthis subject of truth again.\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nProfessor Pratt has returned to the charge in a whole book, [Footnote\\n1: J. B. Pratt: What is Pragmatism. New York, The Macmillan Company,\\n1909.--The comments I have printed were written in March, 1909, after\\nsome of the articles printed later in the present volume.] which for\\nits clearness and good temper deserves to supersede all the rest of\\nthe anti-pragmatistic literature. I wish it might do so; for its author\\nadmits all MY essential contentions, simply distinguishing my account\\nof truth as \\'modified\\' pragmatism from Schiller\\'s and Dewey\\'s, which he\\ncalls pragmatism of the \\'radical\\' sort. As I myself understand Dewey and\\nSchiller, our views absolutely agree, in spite of our different modes of\\nstatement; but I have enough trouble of my own in life without having to\\ndefend my friends, so I abandon them provisionally to the tender mercy\\nof Professor Pratt\\'s interpretations, utterly erroneous tho I deem these\\nto be. My reply as regards myself can be very short, for I prefer to\\nconsider only essentials, and Dr. Pratt\\'s whole book hardly takes the\\nmatter farther than the article to which I retort in Part I of the\\npresent paper.\\n\\nHe repeats the \\'as\\'-formula, as if it were something that I, along with\\nother pragmatists, had denied, [Footnote: Op. cit., pp. 77-80.] whereas\\nI have only asked those who insist so on its importance to do something\\nmore than merely utter it--to explicate it, for example, and tell us\\nwhat its so great importance consists in. I myself agree most cordially\\nthat for an idea to be true the object must be \\'as\\' the idea declares\\nit, but I explicate the \\'as\\'-ness as meaning the idea\\'s verifiability.\\n\\nNow since Dr. Pratt denies none of these verifying \\'workings\\' for which\\nI have pleaded, but only insists on their inability to serve as the\\nfundamentum of the truth-relation, it seems that there is really nothing\\nin the line of FACT about which we differ, and that the issue between us\\nis solely as to how far the notion of workableness or verifiability\\nis an essential part of the notion of \\'trueness\\'--\\'trueness\\' being Dr.\\nPratt\\'s present name for the character of as-ness in the true idea.\\nI maintain that there is no meaning left in this notion of as-ness or\\ntrueness if no reference to the possibility of concrete working on the\\npart of the idea is made.\\n\\nTake an example where there can be no possible working. Suppose I have\\nan idea to which I give utterance by the vocable \\'skrkl,\\' claiming at\\nthe same time that it is true. Who now can say that it is FALSE, for why\\nmay there not be somewhere in the unplumbed depths of the cosmos some\\nobject with which \\'skrkl\\' can agree and have trueness in Dr. Pratt\\'s\\nsense? On the other hand who can say that it is TRUE, for who can lay\\nhis hand on that object and show that it and nothing else is what I MEAN\\nby my word? But yet again, who can gainsay any one who shall call my\\nword utterly IRRELATIVE to other reality, and treat it as a bare fact in\\nmy mind, devoid of any cognitive function whatever. One of these\\nthree alternatives must surely be predicated of it. For it not to be\\nirrelevant (or not-cognitive in nature), an object of some kind must be\\nprovided which it may refer to. Supposing that object provided, whether\\n\\'skrkl\\' is true or false of it, depends, according to Professor Pratt,\\non no intermediating condition whatever. The trueness or the falsity is\\neven now immediately, absolutely, and positively there.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, demand a cosmic environment of some kind to\\nestablish which of them is there rather than utter irrelevancy.\\n[Footnote: Dr. Pratt, singularly enough, disposes of this primal\\npostulate of all pragmatic epistemology, by saying that the pragmatist\\n\\'unconsciously surrenders his whole case by smuggling in the idea of a\\nconditioning environment which determines whether or not the experience\\ncan work, and which cannot itself be identified with the experience or\\nany part of it\\' (pp. 167-168). The \\'experience\\' means here of course the\\nidea, or belief; and the expression \\'smuggling in\\' is to the last degree\\ndiverting. If any epistemologist could dispense with a conditioning\\nenvironment, it would seem to be the antipragmatist, with his immediate\\nsaltatory trueness, independent of work done. The mediating pathway\\nwhich the environment supplies is the very essence of the pragmatist\\'s\\nexplanation.] I then say, first, that unless some sort of a natural path\\nexists between the \\'skrkl\\' and THAT object, distinguishable among the\\ninnumerable pathways that run among all the realities of the universe,\\nlinking them promiscuously with one another, there is nothing there to\\nconstitute even the POSSIBILITY OF ITS REFERRING to that object rather\\nthan to any other.\\n\\nI say furthermore that unless it have some TENDENCY TO FOLLOW UP THAT\\nPATH, there is nothing to constitute its INTENTION to refer to the\\nobject in question.\\n\\nFinally, I say that unless the path be strown with possibilities\\nof frustration or encouragement, and offer some sort of terminal\\nsatisfaction or contradiction, there is nothing to constitute its\\nagreement or disagreement with that object, or to constitute the as-ness\\n(or \\'not-as-ness\\') in which the trueness (or falseness) is said to\\nconsist.\\n\\nI think that Dr. Pratt ought to do something more than repeat the name\\n\\'trueness,\\' in answer to my pathetic question whether that there be not\\nsome CONSTITUTION to a relation as important as this. The pathway, the\\ntendency, the corroborating or contradicting progress, need not in every\\ncase be experienced in full, but I don\\'t see, if the universe doesn\\'t\\ncontain them among its possibilities of furniture, what LOGICAL MATERIAL\\nFOR DEFINING the trueness of my idea is left. But if it do contain them,\\nthey and they only are the logical material required.\\n\\nI am perplexed by the superior importance which Dr. Pratt attributes\\nto abstract trueness over concrete verifiability in an idea, and I wish\\nthat he might be moved to explain. It is prior to verification, to be\\nsure, but so is the verifiability for which I contend prior, just as a\\nman\\'s \\'mortality\\' (which is nothing but the possibility of his death) is\\nprior to his death, but it can hardly be that this abstract priority of\\nall possibility to its correlative fact is what so obstinate a quarrel\\nis about. I think it probable that Dr. Pratt is vaguely thinking\\nof something concreter than this. The trueness of an idea must mean\\nSOMETHING DEFINITE IN IT THAT DETERMINES ITS TENDENCY TO WORK, and\\nindeed towards this object rather than towards that. Undoubtedly there\\nis something of this sort in the idea, just as there is something in man\\nthat accounts for his tendency towards death, and in bread that accounts\\nfor its tendency to nourish. What that something is in the case of truth\\npsychology tells us: the idea has associates peculiar to itself, motor\\nas well as ideational; it tends by its place and nature to call these\\ninto being, one after another; and the appearance of them in succession\\nis what we mean by the \\'workings\\' of the idea. According to what they\\nare, does the trueness or falseness which the idea harbored come to\\nlight. These tendencies have still earlier conditions which, in a\\ngeneral way, biology, psychology and biography can trace. This whole\\nchain of natural causal conditions produces a resultant state of things\\nin which new relations, not simply causal, can now be found, or into\\nwhich they can now be introduced,--the relations namely which we\\nepistemologists study, relations of adaptation, of substitutability, of\\ninstrumentality, of reference and of truth.\\n\\nThe prior causal conditions, altho there could be no knowing of any\\nkind, true or false, without them, are but preliminary to the question\\nof what makes the ideas true or false when once their tendencies have\\nbeen obeyed. The tendencies must exist in some shape anyhow, but their\\nfruits are truth, falsity, or irrelevancy, according to what they\\nconcretely turn out to be. They are not \\'saltatory\\' at any rate, for\\nthey evoke their consequences contiguously, from next to next only; and\\nnot until the final result of the whole associative sequence, actual\\nor potential, is in our mental sight, can we feel sure what its\\nepistemological significance, if it have any, may be. True knowing is,\\nin fine, not substantially, in itself, or \\'as such,\\' inside of the idea\\nfrom the first, any more than mortality AS SUCH is inside of the man, or\\nnourishment AS SUCH inside of the bread. Something else is there first,\\nthat practically MAKES FOR knowing, dying or nourishing, as the case may\\nbe. That something is the \\'nature\\' namely of the first term, be it idea,\\nman, or bread, that operates to start the causal chain of processes\\nwhich, when completed, is the complex fact to which we give whatever\\nfunctional name best fits the case. Another nature, another chain of\\ncognitive workings; and then either another object known or the same\\nobject known differently, will ensue.\\n\\nDr. Pratt perplexes me again by seeming to charge Dewey and Schiller\\n[Footnote: Page 200] (I am not sure that he charges me) with an account\\nof truth which would allow the object believed in not to exist, even\\nif the belief in it were true. \\'Since the truth of an idea,\\' he writes,\\n\\'means merely the fact that the idea works, that fact is all that you\\nmean when you say the idea is true\\' (p. 206). \\'WHEN YOU SAY THE IDEA IS\\nTRUE\\'--does that mean true for YOU, the critic, or true for the believer\\nwhom you are describing? The critic\\'s trouble over this seems to come\\nfrom his taking the word \\'true\\' irrelatively, whereas the pragmatist\\nalways means \\'true for him who experiences the workings.\\' \\'But is the\\nobject REALLY true or not?\\'--the critic then seems to ask,--as if\\nthe pragmatist were bound to throw in a whole ontology on top of his\\nepistemology and tell us what realities indubitably exist. \\'One world at\\na time,\\' would seem to be the right reply here.\\n\\nOne other trouble of Dr. Pratt\\'s must be noticed. It concerns the\\n\\'transcendence\\' of the object. When our ideas have worked so as to bring\\nus flat up against the object, NEXT to it, \\'is our relation to it then\\nambulatory or saltatory?\\' Dr. Pratt asks. If YOUR headache be my object,\\n\\'MY experiences break off where yours begin,\\' Dr. Pratt writes,\\nand \\'this fact is of great importance, for it bars out the sense of\\ntransition and fulfilment which forms so important an element in the\\npragmatist description of knowledge--the sense of fulfilment due to a\\ncontinuous passage from the original idea to the known object. If this\\ncomes at all when I know your headache, it comes not with the object,\\nbut quite on my side of the \"epistemological gulf.\" The gulf is still\\nthere to be transcended.\\' (p. 158).\\n\\nSome day of course, or even now somewhere in the larger life of\\nthe universe, different men\\'s headaches may become confluent or be\\n\\'co-conscious.\\' Here and now, however, headaches do transcend each other\\nand, when not felt, can be known only conceptually. My idea is that\\nyou really have a headache; it works well with what I see of your\\nexpression, and with what I hear you say; but it doesn\\'t put me in\\npossession of the headache itself. I am still at one remove, and the\\nheadache \\'transcends\\' me, even tho it be in nowise transcendent of human\\nexperience generally. Bit the \\'gulf\\' here is that which the pragmatist\\nepistemology itself fixes in the very first words it uses, by\\nsaying there must be an object and an idea. The idea however doesn\\'t\\nimmediately leap the gulf, it only works from next to next so as to\\nbridge it, fully or approximately. If it bridges it, in the pragmatist\\'s\\nvision of his hypothetical universe, it can be called a \\'true\\' idea.\\nIf it only MIGHT bridge it, but doesn\\'t, or if it throws a bridge\\ndistinctly AT it, it still has, in the onlooking pragmatist\\'s eyes, what\\nProfessor Pratt calls \\'trueness.\\' But to ask the pragmatist thereupon\\nwhether, when it thus fails to coalesce bodily with the object, it is\\nREALLY true or has REAL trueness,--in other words whether the headache\\nhe supposes, and supposes the thinker he supposes, to believe in, be\\na real headache or not,--is to step from his hypothetical universe of\\ndiscourse into the altogether different world of natural fact.\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nTHE PRAGMATIST ACCOUNT OF TRUTH AND ITS MISUNDERSTANDERS [Footnote:\\nReprint from the Philosophical Review, January, 1908 (vol. xvii, p. 1).]\\n\\nThe account of truth given in my volume entitled Pragmatism,\\ncontinues to meet with such persistent misunderstanding that I\\nam tempted to make a final brief reply. My ideas may well deserve\\nrefutation, but they can get none till they are conceived of in their\\nproper shape. The fantastic character of the current misconceptions\\nshows how unfamiliar is the concrete point of view which pragmatism\\nassumes. Persons who are familiar with a conception move about so\\neasily in it that they understand each other at a hint, and can converse\\nwithout anxiously attending to their P\\'s and Q\\'s. I have to admit, in\\nview of the results, that we have assumed too ready an intelligence,\\nand consequently in many places used a language too slipshod. We should\\nnever have spoken elliptically. The critics have boggled at every word\\nthey could boggle at, and refused to take the spirit rather than the\\nletter of our discourse. This seems to show a genuine unfamiliarity in\\nthe whole point of view. It also shows, I think, that the second stage\\nof opposition, which has already begun to express itself in the stock\\nphrase that \\'what is new is not true, and what is true not new,\\' in\\npragmatism, is insincere. If we said nothing in any degree new, why\\nwas our meaning so desperately hard to catch? The blame cannot be laid\\nwholly upon our obscurity of speech, for in other subjects we have\\nattained to making ourselves understood. But recriminations are\\ntasteless; and, as far as I personally am concerned, I am sure that some\\nof the misconception I complain of is due to my doctrine of truth being\\nsurrounded in that volume of popular lectures by a lot of other opinions\\nnot necessarily implicated with it, so that a reader may very naturally\\nhave grown confused. For this I am to blame,--likewise for omitting\\ncertain explicit cautions, which the pages that follow will now in part\\nsupply.\\n\\nFIRST MISUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISM IS ONLY A RE-EDITING OF POSITIVISM.\\n\\nThis seems the commonest mistake. Scepticism, positivism, and\\nagnosticism agree with ordinary dogmatic rationalism in presupposing\\nthat everybody knows what the word \\'truth\\' means, without further\\nexplanation. But the former doctrines then either suggest or declare\\nthat real truth, absolute truth, is inaccessible to us, and that we\\nmust fain put up with relative or phenomenal truth as its next best\\nsubstitute. By scepticism this is treated as an unsatisfactory state of\\naffairs, while positivism and agnosticism are cheerful about it, call\\nreal truth sour grapes, and consider phenomenal truth quite sufficient\\nfor all our \\'practical\\' purposes.\\n\\nIn point of fact, nothing could be farther from all this than what\\npragmatism has to say of truth. Its thesis is an altogether previous\\none. It leaves off where these other theories begin, having contented\\nitself with the word truth\\'s DEFINITION. \\'No matter whether any mind\\nextant in the universe possess truth or not,\\' it asks, \\'what does\\nthe notion of truth signify IDEALLY?\\' \\'What kind of things would true\\njudgments be IN CASE they existed?\\' The answer which pragmatism offers\\nis intended to cover the most complete truth that can be conceived of,\\n\\'absolute\\' truth if you like, as well as truth of the most relative and\\nimperfect description. This question of what truth would be like if it\\ndid exist, belongs obviously to a purely speculative field of inquiry.\\nIt is not a theory about any sort of reality, or about what kind of\\nknowledge is actually possible; it abstracts from particular terms\\naltogether, and defines the nature of a possible relation between two of\\nthem.\\n\\nAs Kant\\'s question about synthetic judgments had escaped previous\\nphilosophers, so the pragmatist question is not only so subtile as to\\nhave escaped attention hitherto, but even so subtile, it would seem,\\nthat when openly broached now, dogmatists and sceptics alike fail to\\napprehend it, and deem the pragmatist to be treating of something wholly\\ndifferent. He insists, they say (I quote an actual critic), \\'that the\\ngreater problems are insoluble by human intelligence, that our need of\\nknowing truly is artificial and illusory, and that our reason, incapable\\nof reaching the foundations of reality, must turn itself exclusively\\ntowards ACTION.\\' There could not be a worse misapprehension.\\n\\nSECOND MISUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISM IS PRIMARILY AN APPEAL TO ACTION.\\n\\nThe name \\'pragmatism,\\' with its suggestions of action, has been an\\nunfortunate choice, I have to admit, and has played into the hands of\\nthis mistake. But no word could protect the doctrine from critics so\\nblind to the nature of the inquiry that, when Dr. Schiller speaks of\\nideas \\'working\\' well, the only thing they think of is their immediate\\nworkings in the physical environment, their enabling us to make money,\\nor gain some similar \\'practical\\' advantage. Ideas do work thus, of\\ncourse, immediately or remotely; but they work indefinitely inside of\\nthe mental world also. Not crediting us with this rudimentary insight,\\nour critics treat our view as offering itself exclusively to engineers,\\ndoctors, financiers, and men of action generally, who need some sort\\nof a rough and ready weltanschauung, but have no time or wit to study\\ngenuine philosophy. It is usually described as a characteristically\\nAmerican movement, a sort of bobtailed scheme of thought, excellently\\nfitted for the man on the street, who naturally hates theory and wants\\ncash returns immediately.\\n\\nIt is quite true that, when the refined theoretic question that\\npragmatism begins with is once answered, secondary corollaries of a\\npractical sort follow. Investigation shows that, in the function called\\ntruth, previous realities are not the only independent variables. To\\na certain extent our ideas, being realities, are also independent\\nvariables, and, just as they follow other reality and fit it, so, in\\na measure, does other reality follow and fit them. When they add\\nthemselves to being, they partly redetermine the existent, so that\\nreality as a whole appears incompletely definable unless ideas also\\nare kept account of. This pragmatist doctrine, exhibiting our ideas\\nas complemental factors of reality, throws open (since our ideas are\\ninstigators of our action) a wide window upon human action, as well as a\\nwide license to originality in thought. But few things could be sillier\\nthan to ignore the prior epistemological edifice in which the window is\\nbuilt, or to talk as if pragmatism began and ended at the window. This,\\nnevertheless, is what our critics do almost without exception. They\\nignore our primary step and its motive, and make the relation to action,\\nwhich is our secondary achievement, primary.\\n\\nTHIRD MISUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISTS CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM THE RIGHT TO\\nBELIEVE IN EJECTIVE REALITIES.\\n\\nThey do so, according to the critics, by making the truth of our beliefs\\nconsist in their verifiability, and their verifiability in the way in\\nwhich they do work for us. Professor Stout, in his otherwise admirable\\nand hopeful review of Schiller in Mind for October, 1897, considers that\\nthis ought to lead Schiller (could he sincerely realize the effects of\\nhis own doctrine) to the absurd consequence of being unable to believe\\ngenuinely in another man\\'s headache, even were the headache there.\\nHe can only \\'postulate\\' it for the sake of the working value of the\\npostulate to himself. The postulate guides certain of his acts and leads\\nto advantageous consequences; but the moment he understands fully that\\nthe postulate is true ONLY (!) in this sense, it ceases (or should\\ncease) to be true for him that the other man really HAS a headache. All\\nthat makes the postulate most precious then evaporates: his interest in\\nhis fellow-man \\'becomes a veiled form of self-interest, and his world\\ngrows cold, dull, and heartless.\\'\\n\\nSuch an objection makes a curious muddle of the pragmatist\\'s universe\\nof discourse. Within that universe the pragmatist finds some one with\\na headache or other feeling, and some one else who postulates that\\nfeeling. Asking on what condition the postulate is \\'true\\' the pragmatist\\nreplies that, for the postulator at any rate, it is true just\\nin proportion as to believe in it works in him the fuller sum of\\nsatisfactions. What is it that is satisfactory here? Surely to BELIEVE\\nin the postulated object, namely, in the really existing feeling of\\nthe other man. But how (especially if the postulator were himself a\\nthoroughgoing pragmatist) could it ever be satisfactory to him NOT\\nto believe in that feeling, so long as, in Professor Stout\\'s words,\\ndisbelief \\'made the world seem to him cold, dull, and heartless\\'?\\nDisbelief would seem, on pragmatist principles, quite out of the\\nquestion under such conditions, unless the heartlessness of the world\\nwere made probable already on other grounds. And since the belief in the\\nheadache, true for the subject assumed in the pragmatist\\'s universe of\\ndiscourse, is also true for the pragmatist who for his epitemologizing\\npurposes has assumed that entire universe, why is it not true in that\\nuniverse absolutely? The headache believed in is a reality there, and no\\nextant mind disbelieves it, neither the critic\\'s mind nor his subject\\'s!\\nHave our opponents any better brand of truth in this real universe of\\nours that they can show us? [Footnote: I see here a chance to forestall\\na criticism which some one may make on Lecture III of my Pragmatism,\\nwhere, on pp. 96-100, I said that \\'God\\' and \\'Matter\\' might be regarded\\nas synonymous terms, so long as no differing future consequences were\\ndeducible from the two conceptions. The passage was transcribed from my\\naddress at the California Philosophical Union, reprinted in the Journal\\nof Philosophy, vol. i, p. 673. I had no sooner given the address than\\nI perceived a flaw in that part of it; but I have left the passage\\nunaltered ever since, because the flaw did not spoil its illustrative\\nvalue. The flaw was evident when, as a case analogous to that of a\\ngodless universe, I thought of what I called an \\'automatic sweetheart,\\'\\nmeaning a soulless body which should be absolutely indistinguishable\\nfrom a spiritually animated maiden, laughing, talking, blushing, nursing\\nus, and performing all feminine offices as tactfully and sweetly as if\\na soul were in her. Would any one regard her as a full equivalent?\\nCertainly not, and why? Because, framed as we are, our egoism craves\\nabove all things inward sympathy and recognition, love and admiration.\\nThe outward treatment is valued mainly as an expression, as a\\nmanifestation of the accompanying consciousness believed in.\\nPragmatically, then, belief in the automatic sweetheart would not work,\\nand is point of fact no one treats it as a serious hypothesis. The\\ngodless universe would be exactly similar. Even if matter could do\\nevery outward thing that God does, the idea of it would not work as\\nsatisfactorily, because the chief call for a God on modern men\\'s part\\nis for a being who will inwardly recognize them and judge them\\nsympathetically. Matter disappoints this craving of our ego, so God\\nremains for most men the truer hypothesis, and indeed remains so for\\ndefinite pragmatic reasons.]\\n\\nSo much for the third misunderstanding, which is but one specification\\nof the following still wider one.\\n\\nFOURTH MISUNDERSTANDING: NO PRAGMATIST CAN BE A REALIST IN HIS\\nEPISTEMOLOGY.\\n\\nThis is supposed to follow from his statement that the truth of our\\nbeliefs consists in general in their giving satisfaction. Of course\\nsatisfaction per se is a subjective condition; so the conclusion is\\ndrawn that truth falls wholly inside of the subject, who then may\\nmanufacture it at his pleasure. True beliefs become thus wayward\\naffections, severed from all responsibility to other parts of\\nexperience.\\n\\nIt is difficult to excuse such a parody of the pragmatist\\'s opinion,\\nignoring as it does every element but one of his universe of discourse.\\nThe terms of which that universe consists positively forbid any\\nnon-realistic interpretation of the function of knowledge defined there.\\nThe pragmatizing epistemologist posits there a reality and a mind with\\nideas. What, now, he asks, can make those ideas true of that reality?\\nOrdinary epistemology contents itself with the vague statement that the\\nideas must \\'correspond\\' or \\'agree\\'; the pragmatist insists on being more\\nconcrete, and asks what such \\'agreement\\' may mean in detail. He finds\\nfirst that the ideas must point to or lead towards THAT reality and no\\nother, and then that the pointings and leadings must yield satisfaction\\nas their result. So far the pragmatist is hardly less abstract than the\\nordinary slouchy epistemologist; but as he defines himself farther, he\\ngrows more concrete. The entire quarrel of the intellectualist with him\\nis over his concreteness, intellectualism contending that the vaguer and\\nmore abstract account is here the more profound. The concrete pointing\\nand leading are conceived by the pragmatist to be the work of other\\nportions of the same universe to which the reality and the mind belong,\\nintermediary verifying bits of experience with which the mind at one\\nend, and the reality at the other, are joined. The \\'satisfaction,\\' in\\nturn, is no abstract satisfaction ueberhaupt, felt by an unspecified\\nbeing, but is assumed to consist of such satisfactions (in the plural)\\nas concretely existing men actually do find in their beliefs. As we\\nhumans are constituted in point of fact, we find that to believe in\\nother men\\'s minds, in independent physical realities, in past events, in\\neternal logical relations, is satisfactory. We find hope satisfactory.\\nWe often find it satisfactory to cease to doubt. Above all we find\\nCONSISTENCY satisfactory, consistency between the present idea and the\\nentire rest of our mental equipment, including the whole order of our\\nsensations, and that of our intuitions of likeness and difference, and\\nour whole stock of previously acquired truths.\\n\\nThe pragmatist, being himself a man, and imagining in general no\\ncontrary lines of truer belief than ours about the \\'reality\\' which he\\nhas laid at the base of his epistemological discussion, is willing to\\ntreat our satisfactions as possibly really true guides to it, not as\\nguides true solely for US. It would seem here to be the duty of his\\ncritics to show with some explicitness why, being our subjective\\nfeelings, these satisfactions can not yield \\'objective\\' truth. The\\nbeliefs which they accompany \\'posit\\' the assumed reality, \\'correspond\\'\\nand \\'agree\\' with it, and \\'fit\\' it in perfectly definite and assignable\\nways, through the sequent trains of thought and action which form\\ntheir verification, so merely to insist on using these words abstractly\\ninstead of concretely is no way of driving the pragmatist from the\\nfield,--his more concrete account virtually includes his critic\\'s. If\\nour critics have any definite idea of a truth more objectively grounded\\nthan the kind we propose, why do they not show it more articulately?\\nAs they stand, they remind one of Hegel\\'s man who wanted \\'fruit,\\' but\\nrejected cherries, pears, and grapes, because they were not fruit in the\\nabstract. We offer them the full quart-pot, and they cry for the empty\\nquart-capacity.\\n\\nBut here I think I hear some critic retort as follows: \\'If satisfactions\\nare all that is needed to make truth, how about the notorious fact that\\nerrors are so often satisfactory? And how about the equally notorious\\nfact that certain true beliefs may cause the bitterest dissatisfaction?\\nIsn\\'t it clear that not the satisfaction which it gives, but the\\nrelation of the belief TO THE REALITY is all that makes it true? Suppose\\nthere were no such reality, and that the satisfactions yet remained:\\nwould they not then effectively work falsehood? Can they consequently be\\ntreated distinctively as the truth-builders? It is the INHERENT RELATION\\nTO REALITY of a belief that gives us that specific TRUTH-satisfaction,\\ncompared with which all other satisfactions are the hollowest humbug.\\nThe satisfaction of KNOWING TRULY is thus the only one which the\\npragmatist ought to have considered. As a PSYCHOLOGICAL SENTIMENT,\\nthe anti-pragmatist gladly concedes it to him, but then only as a\\nconcomitant of truth, not as a constituent. What CONSTITUTES truth\\nis not the sentiment, but the purely logical or objective function of\\nrightly cognizing the reality, and the pragmatist\\'s failure to reduce\\nthis function to lower values is patent.\\'\\n\\nSuch anti-pragmatism as this seems to me a tissue of confusion. To begin\\nwith, when the pragmatist says \\'indispensable,\\' it confounds this with\\n\\'sufficient.\\' The pragmatist calls satisfactions indispensable for\\ntruth-building, but I have everywhere called them insufficient unless\\nreality be also incidentally led to. If the reality assumed were\\ncancelled from the pragmatist\\'s universe of discourse, he would\\nstraightway give the name of falsehoods to the beliefs remaining, in\\nspite of all their satisfactoriness. For him, as for his critic, there\\ncan be no truth if there is nothing to be true about. Ideas are so\\nmuch flat psychological surface unless some mirrored matter gives\\nthem cognitive lustre. This is why as a pragmatist I have so carefully\\nposited \\'reality\\' AB INITIO, and why, throughout my whole discussion, I\\nremain an epistemological realist. [Footnote: I need hardly remind\\nthe reader that both sense-percepts and percepts of ideal relation\\n(comparisons, etc.) should be classed among the realities. The bulk of\\nour mental \\'stock\\' consists of truths concerning these terms.]\\n\\nThe anti-pragmatist is guilty of the further confusion of imagining\\nthat, in undertaking to give him an account of what truth formally\\nmeans, we are assuming at the same time to provide a warrant for\\nit, trying to define the occasions when he can be sure of materially\\npossessing it. Our making it hinge on a reality so \\'independent\\' that\\nwhen it comes, truth comes, and when it goes, truth goes with it,\\ndisappoints this naive expectation, so he deems our description\\nunsatisfactory. I suspect that under this confusion lies the still\\ndeeper one of not discriminating sufficiently between the two notions,\\ntruth and reality. Realities are not TRUE, they ARE; and beliefs are\\ntrue OF them. But I suspect that in the anti-pragmatist mind the two\\nnotions sometimes swap their attributes. The reality itself, I fear, is\\ntreated as if \\'true\\' and conversely. Whoso tells us of the one, it is\\nthen supposed, must also be telling us of the other; and a true idea\\nmust in a manner BE, or at least YIELD without extraneous aid, the\\nreality it cognitively is possessed of.\\n\\nTo this absolute-idealistic demand pragmatism simply opposes its non\\npossumus. If there is to be truth, it says, both realities and beliefs\\nabout them must conspire to make it; but whether there ever is such a\\nthing, or how anyone can be sure that his own beliefs possess it, it\\nnever pretends to determine. That truth-satisfaction par excellence\\nwhich may tinge a belief unsatisfactory in other ways, it easily\\nexplains as the feeling of consistency with the stock of previous\\ntruths, or supposed truths, of which one\\'s whole past experience may\\nhave left one in possession.\\n\\nBut are not all pragmatists sure that their own belief is right? their\\nenemies will ask at this point; and this leads me to the\\n\\nFIFTH MISUNDERSTANDING: WHAT PRAGMATISTS SAY IS INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR\\nSAYING SO.\\n\\nA correspondent puts this objection as follows: \\'When you say to your\\naudience, \"pragmatism is the truth concerning truth,\" the first truth is\\ndifferent from the second. About the first you and they are not to be at\\nodds; you are not giving them liberty to take or leave it according as\\nit works satisfactorily or not for their private uses. Yet the second\\ntruth, which ought to describe and include the first, affirms this\\nliberty. Thus the INTENT of your utterance seems to contradict the\\nCONTENT of it.\\'\\n\\nGeneral scepticism has always received this same classic refutation.\\n\\'You have to dogmatize,\\' the rationalists say to the sceptics,\\' whenever\\nyou express the sceptical position; so your lives keep contradicting\\nyour thesis.\\' One would suppose that the impotence of so hoary an\\nargument to abate in the slightest degree the amount of general\\nscepticism in the world might have led some rationalists themselves to\\ndoubt whether these instantaneous logical refutations are such\\nfatal ways, after all, of killing off live mental attitudes. General\\nscepticism is the live mental attitude of refusing to conclude. It is\\na permanent torpor of the will, renewing itself in detail towards each\\nsuccessive thesis that offers, and you can no more kill it off by logic\\nthan you can kill off obstinacy or practical joking. This is why it is\\nso irritating. Your consistent sceptic never puts his scepticism into\\na formal proposition,--he simply chooses it as a habit. He provokingly\\nhangs back when he might so easily join us in saying yes, but he is\\nnot illogical or stupid,--on the contrary, he often impresses us by his\\nintellectual superiority. This is the REAL scepticism that rationalists\\nhave to meet, and their logic does not even touch it.\\n\\nNo more can logic kill the pragmatist\\'s behavior: his act of utterance,\\nso far from contradicting, accurately exemplifies the matter which he\\nutters. What is the matter which he utters? In part, it is this, that\\ntruth, concretely considered, is an attribute of our beliefs, and that\\nthese are attitudes that follow satisfactions. The ideas around which\\nthe satisfactions cluster are primarily only hypotheses that\\nchallenge or summon a belief to come and take its stand upon them.\\nThe pragmatist\\'s idea of truth is just such a challenge. He finds it\\nultra-satisfactory to accept it, and takes his own stand accordingly.\\nBut, being gregarious as they are, men seek to spread their beliefs,\\nto awaken imitation, to infect others. Why should not YOU also find the\\nsame belief satisfactory? thinks the pragmatist, and forthwith endeavors\\nto convert you. You and he will then believe similarly; you will hold\\nup your subject-end of a truth, which will be a truth objective and\\nirreversible if the reality holds up the object-end by being itself\\npresent simultaneously. What there is of self-contradiction in all this\\nI confess I cannot discover. The pragmatist\\'s conduct in his own case\\nseems to me on the contrary admirably to illustrate his universal\\nformula; and of all epistemologists, he is perhaps the only one who is\\nirreproachably self-consistent.\\n\\nSIXTH MISUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISM EXPLAINS NOT WHAT TRUTH IS, BUT ONLY\\nHOW IT IS ARRIVED AT.\\n\\nIn point of fact it tells us both, tells us what it is incidentally to\\ntelling us how it is arrived at,--for what IS arrived at except just\\nwhat the truth is? If I tell you how to get to the railroad station,\\ndon\\'t I implicitly introduce you to the WHAT, to the being and nature of\\nthat edifice? It is quite true that the abstract WORD \\'how\\' hasn\\'t\\nthe same meaning as the abstract WORD \\'what,\\' but in this universe of\\nconcrete facts you cannot keep hows and whats asunder. The reasons why\\nI find it satisfactory to believe that any idea is true, the HOW of my\\narriving at that belief, may be among the very reasons why the idea IS\\ntrue in reality. If not, I summon the anti-pragmatist to explain the\\nimpossibility articulately.\\n\\nHis trouble seems to me mainly to arise from his fixed inability to\\nunderstand how a concrete statement can possibly mean as much, or be as\\nvaluable, as an abstract one. I said above that the main quarrel between\\nus and our critics was that of concreteness VERSUS abstractness. This is\\nthe place to develop that point farther.\\n\\nIn the present question, the links of experience sequent upon an idea,\\nwhich mediate between it and a reality, form and for the pragmatist\\nindeed ARE, the CONCRETE relation of truth that may obtain between the\\nidea and that reality. They, he says, are all that we mean when we speak\\nof the idea \\'pointing\\' to the reality, \\'fitting\\' it, \\'corresponding\\'\\nwith it, or \\'agreeing\\' with it,--they or other similar mediating trains\\nof verification. Such mediating events make the idea \\'true.\\' The idea\\nitself, if it exists at all, is also a concrete event: so pragmatism\\ninsists that truth in the singular is only a collective name for truths\\nin the plural, these consisting always of series of definite events; and\\nthat what intellectualism calls the truth, the inherent truth, of any\\none such series is only the abstract name for its truthfulness in act,\\nfor the fact that the ideas there do lead to the supposed reality in a\\nway that we consider satisfactory.\\n\\nThe pragmatist himself has no objection to abstractions. Elliptically,\\nand \\'for short,\\' he relies on them as much as any one, ending upon\\ninnumerable occasions that their comparative emptiness makes of them\\nuseful substitutes for the overfulness of the facts he meets, with. But\\nhe never ascribes to them a higher grade of reality. The full reality\\nof a truth for him is always some process of verification, in which the\\nabstract property of connecting ideas with objects truly is workingly\\nembodied. Meanwhile it is endlessly serviceable to be able to talk of\\nproperties abstractly and apart from their working, to find them the\\nsame in innumerable cases, to take them \\'out of time,\\' and to treat\\nof their relations to other similar abstractions. We thus form whole\\nuniverses of platonic ideas ante rem, universes in posse, tho none of\\nthem exists effectively except in rebus. Countless relations obtain\\nthere which nobody experiences as obtaining,--as, in the eternal\\nuniverse of musical relations, for example, the notes of Aennchen von\\nTharau were a lovely melody long ere mortal ears ever heard them. Even\\nso the music of the future sleeps now, to be awakened hereafter. Or, if\\nwe take the world of geometrical relations, the thousandth decimal of\\n\\'pi\\' sleeps there, tho no one may ever try to compute it. Or, if we take\\nthe universe of \\'fitting,\\' countless coats \\'fit\\' backs, and countless\\nboots \\'fit\\' feet, on which they are not practically FITTED; countless\\nstones \\'fit\\' gaps in walls into which no one seeks to fit them actually.\\nIn the same way countless opinions \\'fit\\' realities, and countless truths\\nare valid, tho no thinker ever thinks them.\\n\\nFor the anti-pragmatist these prior timeless relations are the\\npresupposition of the concrete ones, and possess the profounder dignity\\nand value. The actual workings of our ideas in verification-processes\\nare as naught in comparison with the \\'obtainings\\' of this discarnate\\ntruth within them.\\n\\nFor the pragmatist, on the contrary,--all discarnate truth is static,\\nimpotent, and relatively spectral, full truth being the truth that\\nenergizes and does battle. Can any one suppose that the sleeping quality\\nof truth would ever have been abstracted or have received a name, if\\ntruths had remained forever in that storage-vault of essential timeless\\n\\'agreements\\' and had never been embodied in any panting struggle of\\nmen\\'s live ideas for verification? Surely no more than the abstract\\nproperty of \\'fitting\\' would have received a name, if in our world\\nthere had been no backs or feet or gaps in walls to be actually fitted.\\nEXISTENTIAL truth is incidental to the actual competition of opinions.\\nESSENTIAL truth, the truth of the intellectualists, the truth with no\\none thinking it, is like the coat that fits tho no one has ever tried\\nit on, like the music that no ear has listened to. It is less real, not\\nmore real, than the verified article; and to attribute a superior\\ndegree of glory to it seems little more than a piece of perverse\\nabstraction-worship. As well might a pencil insist that the outline\\nis the essential thing in all pictorial representation, and chide\\nthe paint-brush and the camera for omitting it, forgetting that THEIR\\npictures not only contain the whole outline, but a hundred other things\\nin addition. Pragmatist truth contains the whole of intellectualist\\ntruth and a hundred other things in addition. Intellectualist truth is\\nthen only pragmatist truth in posse. That on innumerable occasions men\\ndo substitute truth in posse or verifiability, for verification or truth\\nin act, is a fact to which no one attributes more importance than the\\npragmatist: he emphasizes the practical utility of such a habit. But\\nhe does not on that account consider truth in posse,--truth not alive\\nenough ever to have been asserted or questioned or contradicted, to be\\nthe metaphysically prior thing, to which truths in act are tributary and\\nsubsidiary. When intellectualists do this, pragmatism charges them with\\ninverting the real relation. Truth in posse MEANS only truths in act;\\nand he insists that these latter take precedence in the order of logic\\nas well as in that of being.\\n\\nSEVENTH MINUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISM IGNORES THE THEORETICAL INTEREST.\\n\\nThis would seem to be an absolutely wanton slander, were not a\\ncertain excuse to be found in the linguistic affinities of the word\\n\\'pragmatism,\\' and in certain offhand habits of speech of ours which\\nassumed too great a generosity on our reader\\'s part. When we spoke of\\nthe meaning of ideas consisting \"in their \\'practical\\' consequences\",\\nor of the \\'practical\\' differences which our beliefs make to us; when we\\nsaid that the truth of a belief consists in its \\'working\\' value, etc.;\\nour language evidently was too careless, for by \\'practical\\' we were\\nalmost unanimously held to mean OPPOSED to theoretical or genuinely\\ncognitive, and the consequence was punctually drawn that a truth in our\\neyes could have no relation to any independent reality, or to any other\\ntruth, or to anything whatever but the acts which we might ground on it\\nor the satisfactions they might bring. The mere existence of the idea,\\nall by itself, if only its results were satisfactory, would give full\\ntruth to it, it was charged, in our absurd pragmatist epistemology.\\nThe solemn attribution of this rubbish to us was also encouraged by two\\nother circumstances. First, ideas ARE practically useful in the narrow\\nsense, false ideas sometimes, but most often ideas which we can verify\\nby the sum total of all their leadings, and the reality of whose objects\\nmay thus be considered established beyond doubt. That these ideas should\\nbe true in advance of and apart from their utility, that, in other\\nwords, their objects should be really there, is the very condition of\\ntheir having that kind of utility,--the objects they connect us with are\\nso important that the ideas which serve as the objects\\' substitutes grow\\nimportant also. This manner of their practical working was the first\\nthing that made truths good in the eyes of primitive men; and\\nburied among all the other good workings by which true beliefs are\\ncharacterized, this kind of subsequential utility remains.\\n\\nThe second misleading circumstance was the emphasis laid by Schiller\\nand Dewey on the fact that, unless a truth be relevant to the mind\\'s\\nmomentary predicament, unless it be germane to the \\'practical\\'\\nsituation,--meaning by this the quite particular perplexity,--it is\\nno good to urge it. It doesn\\'t meet our interests any better than a\\nfalsehood would under the same circumstances. But why our predicaments\\nand perplexities might not be theoretical here as well as narrowly\\npractical, I wish that our critics would explain. They simply assume\\nthat no pragmatist CAN admit a genuinely theoretic interest. Having used\\nthe phrase \\'cash-value\\' of an idea, I am implored by one correspondent\\nto alter it, \\'for every one thinks you mean only pecuniary profit and\\nloss.\\' Having said that the true is \\'the expedient in our thinking,\\' I\\nam rebuked in this wise by another learned correspondent:\\n\\n\\'The word expedient has no other meaning than that of self-interest. The\\npursuit of this has ended by landing a number of officers of national\\nbanks in penitentiaries. A philosophy that leads to such results must be\\nunsound.\\'\\n\\nBut the word \\'practical\\' is so habitually loosely used that more\\nindulgence might have been expected. When one says that a sick man has\\nnow practically recovered, or that an enterprise has practically failed,\\none usually means I just the opposite of practically in the literal\\nsense. One means that, altho untrue in strict practice, what one says\\nis true in theory, true virtually, certain to be true. Again, by the\\npractical one often means the distinctively concrete, the individual,\\nparticular, and effective, as opposed to the abstract, general, and\\ninert. To speak for myself, whenever I have emphasized the practical\\nnature of truth, this is mainly what has been in my mind. \\'Pragmata\\' are\\nthings in their plurality; and in that early California address, when I\\ndescribed pragmatism as holding that the meaning of any proposition\\ncan always be brought down to some particular consequence in our future\\npractical experience, whether passive or active, expressly added these\\nqualifying words: the point lying rather in the fact that the experience\\nmust be particular than in the fact that it must be active,--by \\'active\\'\\nmeaning here \\'practical\\' in the narrow literal sense. [Footnote: The\\nambiguity of the word \\'practical\\' comes out well in these words of a\\nrecent would-be reporter of our views: \\'Pragmatism is an Anglo-Saxon\\nreaction against the intellectualism and rationalism of the Latin\\nmind.... Man, each individual man is the measure of things. He is able\\nto conceive one but relative truths, that is to say, illusions. What\\nthese illusions are worth is revealed to him, not by general theory, but\\nby individual practice. Pragmatism, which consists in experiencing\\nthese illusions of the mind and obeying them by acting them out, is a\\nPHILOSOPHY WITHOUT WORDS, a philosophy of GESTURES AND OF ACTS,\\nwhich abandons what is general and olds only to what is particular.\\'\\n(Bourdeau, in Journal des. debats, October 89, 1907.)] But particular\\nconsequences can perfectly well be of a theoretic nature. Every remote\\nfact which we infer from an idea is a particular theoretic consequence\\nwhich our mind practically works towards. The loss of every old opinion\\nof ours which we see that we shall have to give up if a new opinion\\nbe true, is a particular theoretic as well as a particular practical\\nconsequence. After man\\'s interest in breathing freely, the greatest of\\nall his interests (because it never fluctuates or remits, as most of his\\nphysical interests do), is his interest in consistency, in feeling\\nthat what he now thinks goes with what he thinks on other occasions.\\nWe tirelessly compare truth with truth for this sole purpose. Is the\\npresent candidate for belief perhaps contradicted by principle number\\none? Is it compatible with fact number two? and so forth. The particular\\noperations here are the purely logical ones of analysis, deduction,\\ncomparison, etc.; and altho general terms may be used ad libitum, the\\nsatisfactory practical working of the candidate--idea consists in\\nthe consciousness yielded by each successive theoretic consequence in\\nparticular. It is therefore simply idiotic to repeat that pragmatism\\ntakes no account of purely theoretic interests. All it insists on\\nis that verity in act means VERIFICATIONS, and that these are always\\nparticulars. Even in exclusively theoretic matters, it insists that\\nvagueness and generality serve to verify nothing.\\n\\nEIGHTH MISUNDERSTANDING: PRAGMATISM IS SHUT UP TO SOLIPSISM.\\n\\nI have already said something about this misconception under the third\\nand fourth heads, above, but a little more may be helpful. The objection\\nis apt to clothe itself in words like these: \\'You make truth to consist\\nin every value except the cognitive value proper; you always leave your\\nknower at many removes (or, at the uttermost, at one remove) from his\\nreal object; the best you do is to let his ideas carry him towards it;\\nit remains forever outside of him,\\' etc.\\n\\nI think that the leaven working here is the rooted intellectualist\\npersuasion that, to know a reality, an idea must in some inscrutable\\nfashion possess or be it. [Footnote: Sensations may, indeed, possess\\ntheir objects or coalesce with them, as common sense supposes that they\\ndo; and intuited differences between concepts may coalesce with the\\n\\'eternal\\' objective differences; but to simplify our discussion. here\\nwe can afford to abstract from these very special cases of knowing.]\\nFor pragmatism this kind of coalescence is inessential. As a rule our\\ncognitions are only processes of mind off their balance and in motion\\ntowards real termini; and the reality of the termini, believed in by the\\nstates of mind in question, can be guaranteed only by some wider knower\\n[Footnote: The transcendental idealist thinks that, in some inexplicable\\nway, the finite states of mind are identical with the transfinite\\nall-knower which he finds himself obliged to postulate in order to\\nsupply a fundamentum far the relation of knowing, as he apprehends it.\\nPragmatists can leave the question of identity open; but they cannot do\\nwithout the wider knower any more than they can do without the reality,\\nif they want to prove a case of knowing. They themselves play the part\\nof the absolute knower for the universe of discourse which serves them\\nas material for epistemologizing. They warrant the reality there,\\nand the subject\\'s true knowledge, there, of it. But whether what they\\nthemselves say about that whole universe is objectively true, i.e.,\\nwhether the pragmatic theory of truth is true really, they cannot\\nwarrant,--they can only believe it To their hearers they can only\\npropose it, as I propose it to my readers, as something to be verified\\nambulando, or by the way is which its consequences may confirm it]. But\\nif there is no reason extant in the universe why they should be doubted,\\nthe beliefs are true in the only sense in which anything can be true\\nanyhow: they are practically and concretely true, namely. True in the\\nmystical mongrel sense of an Identitatsphilosophie they need not be; nor\\nis there any intelligible reason why they ever need be true otherwise\\nthan verifiably and practically. It is reality\\'s part to possess its\\nown existence; it is thought\\'s part to get into \\'touch\\' with it by\\ninnumerable paths of verification.\\n\\nI fear that the \\'humanistic\\' developments of pragmatism may cause a\\ncertain difficulty here. We get at one truth only through the rest of\\ntruth; and the reality, everlastingly postulated as that which all our\\ntruth must keep in touch with, may never be given to us save in the\\nform of truth other than that which we are now testing. But since Dr.\\nSchiller has shown that all our truths, even the most elemental, are\\naffected by race-inheritance with a human coefficient, reality per se\\nthus may appear only as a sort of limit; it may be held to shrivel to\\nthe mere PLACE for an object, and what is known may be held to be only\\nmatter of our psyche that we fill the place with. It must be confessed\\nthat pragmatism, worked in this humanistic way, is COMPATIBLE with\\nsolipsism. It joins friendly hands with the agnostic part of kantism,\\nwith contemporary agnosticism, and with idealism generally. But worked\\nthus, it is a metaphysical theory about the matter of reality, and flies\\nfar beyond pragmatism\\'s own modest analysis of the nature of the knowing\\nfunction, which analysis may just as harmoniously be combined with less\\nhumanistic accounts of reality. One of pragmatism\\'s merits is that it\\nis so purely epistemological. It must assume realities; but it prejudges\\nnothing as to their constitution, and the most diverse metaphysics can\\nuse it as their foundation. It certainly has no special affinity with\\nsolipsism.\\n\\nAs I look back over what I have written, much of it gives me a queer\\nimpression, as if the obvious were set forth so condescendingly that\\nreaders might well laugh at my pomposity. It may be, however, that\\nconcreteness as radical as ours is not so obvious. The whole originality\\nof pragmatism, the whole point in it, is its use of the concrete way of\\nseeing. It begins with concreteness, and returns and ends with it. Dr.\\nSchiller, with his two \\'practical\\' aspects of truth, (1) relevancy to\\nsituation, and (2) subsequential utility, is only filling the cup of\\nconcreteness to the brim for us. Once seize that cup, and you cannot\\nmisunderstand pragmatism. It seems as if the power of imagining the\\nworld concretely MIGHT have been common enough to let our readers\\napprehend us better, as if they might have read between our lines, and,\\nin spite of all our infelicities of expression, guessed a little\\nmore correctly what our thought was. But alas! this was not on fate\\'s\\nprogramme, so we can only think, with the German ditty:--\\n\\n   \"Es waer\\' zu schoen gewesen, Es hat nicht sollen sein.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nTHE MEANING OF THE WORD TRUTH [Footnote: Remarks at the meeting of the\\nAmerican Philosophical Association, Cornell University, December, 1907.]\\n\\nMy account of truth is realistic, and follows the epistemological\\ndualism of common sense. Suppose I say to you \\'The thing exists\\'--is\\nthat true or not? How can you tell? Not till my statement has developed\\nits meaning farther is it determined as being true, false, or irrelevant\\nto reality altogether. But if now you ask \\'what thing?\\' and I reply \\'a\\ndesk\\'; if you ask \\'where?\\' and I point to a place; if you ask \\'does it\\nexist materially, or only in imagination?\\' and I say \\'materially\\'; if\\nmoreover I say \\'I mean that desk\\' and then grasp and shake a desk\\nwhich you see just as I have described it, you are willing to call\\nmy statement true. But you and I are commutable here; we can exchange\\nplaces; and, as you go bail for my desk, so I can go bail for yours.\\n\\nThis notion of a reality independent of either of us, taken from\\nordinary social experience, lies at the base of the pragmatist\\ndefinition of truth. With some such reality any statement, in order\\nto be counted true, must agree. Pragmatism defines \\'agreeing\\' to mean\\ncertain ways of \\'working,\\' be they actual or potential. Thus, for my\\nstatement \\'the desk exists\\' to be true of a desk recognized as real by\\nyou, it must be able to lead me to shake your desk, to explain myself\\nby words that suggest that desk to your mind, to make a drawing that is\\nlike the desk you see, etc. Only in such ways as this is there sense in\\nsaying it agrees with THAT reality, only thus does it gain for me the\\nsatisfaction of hearing you corroborate me. Reference then to something\\ndeterminate, and some sort of adaptation to it worthy of the name\\nof agreement, are thus constituent elements in the definition of any\\nstatement of mine as \\'true\\'.\\n\\nYou cannot get at either the reference or the adaptation without using\\nthe notion of the workings. THAT the thing is, WHAT it is, and WHICH it\\nis (of all the possible things with that what) are points determinable\\nonly by the pragmatic method. The \\'which\\' means a possibility of\\npointing, or of otherwise singling out the special object; the \\'what\\'\\nmeans choice on our part of an essential aspect to conceive it by (and\\nthis is always relative to what Dewey calls our own \\'situation\\');\\nand the \\'that\\' means our assumption of the attitude of belief, the\\nreality-recognizing attitude. Surely for understanding what the word\\n\\'true\\' means as applied to a statement, the mention of such workings is\\nindispensable. Surely if we leave them out the subject and the object\\nof the cognitive relation float-in the same universe, \\'tis true--but\\nvaguely and ignorantly and without mutual contact or mediation.\\n\\nOur critics nevertheless call the workings inessential. No functional\\npossibilities \\'make\\' our beliefs true, they say; they are true\\ninherently, true positively, born \\'true\\' as the Count of Chambord was\\nborn \\'Henri-Cinq.\\' Pragmatism insists, on the contrary, that statements\\nand beliefs are thus inertly and statically true only by courtesy:\\nthey practically pass for true; but you CANNOT DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN by\\ncalling them true without referring to their functional possibilities.\\nThese give its whole LOGICAL CONTENT to that relation to reality on a\\nbelief\\'s part to which the name \\'truth\\' is applied, a relation which\\notherwise remains one of mere coexistence or bare withness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe foregoing statements reproduce the essential content of the lecture\\non Truth in my book PRAGMATISM. Schiller\\'s doctrine of \\'humanism,\\'\\nDewey\\'s \\'Studies in logical theory,\\' and my own \\'radical empiricism,\\'\\nall involve this general notion of truth as \\'working,\\' either actual or\\nconceivable. But they envelop it as only one detail in the midst of much\\nwider theories that aim eventually at determining the notion of what\\n\\'reality\\' at large is in its ultimate nature and constitution.\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nTHE EXISTENCE OF JULIUS CAESAR [Footnote: Originally printed under the\\ntitle of \\'Truth versus Truthfulness,\\' in the Journal of Philosophy.]\\n\\nMy account of truth is purely logical and relates to its definition\\nonly. I contend that you cannot tell what the WORD \\'true\\' MEANS, as\\napplied to a statement, without invoking the CONCEPT OF THE STATEMENTS\\nWORKINGS.\\n\\nAssume, to fix our ideas, a universe composed of two things only:\\nimperial Caesar dead and turned to clay, and me, saying \\'Caesar really\\nexisted.\\' Most persons would naively deem truth to be thereby uttered,\\nand say that by a sort of actio in distans my statement had taken direct\\nhold of the other fact.\\n\\nBut have my words so certainly denoted THAT Caesar?--or so certainly\\nconnoted HIS individual attributes? To fill out the complete measure\\nof what the epithet \\'true\\' may ideally mean, my thought ought to bear\\na fully determinate and unambiguous \\'one-to-one-relation\\' to its own\\nparticular object. In the ultrasimple universe imagined the reference is\\nuncertified. Were there two Caesars we shouldn\\'t know which was meant.\\nThe conditions of truth thus seem incomplete in this universe of\\ndiscourse so that it must be enlarged.\\n\\nTranscendentalists enlarge it by invoking an absolute mind which,\\nas it owns all the facts, can sovereignly correlate them. If it intends\\nthat my statement SHALL refer to that identical Caesar, and that the\\nattributes I have in mind SHALL mean his attributes, that intention\\nsuffices to make the statement true.\\n\\nI, in turn, enlarge the universe by admitting finite intermediaries\\nbetween the two original facts. Caesar HAD, and my statement HAS,\\neffects; and if these effects in any way run together, a concrete medium\\nand bottom is provided for the determinate cognitive relation, which, as\\na pure ACTIO IN DISTANS, seemed to float too vaguely and unintelligibly.\\n\\nThe real Caesar, for example, wrote a manuscript of which I see a\\nreal reprint, and say \\'the Caesar I mean is the author of THAT.\\' The\\nworkings of my thought thus determine both its denotative and its\\nconnotative significance more fully. It now defines itself as neither\\nirrelevant to the real Caesar, nor false in what it suggests of him. The\\nabsolute mind, seeing me thus working towards Caesar through the cosmic\\nintermediaries, might well say: \\'Such workings only specify in detail\\nwhat I meant myself by the statement being true. I decree the cognitive\\nrelation between the two original facts to mean that just that kind of\\nconcrete chain of intermediaries exists or can exist.\\'\\n\\nBut the chain involves facts prior to the statement the logical\\nconditions of whose truth we are defining, and facts subsequent to it;\\nand this circumstance, coupled with the vulgar employment of the terms\\ntruth and fact as synonyms, has laid my account open to misapprehension.\\n\\'How,\\' it is confusedly asked, \\'can Caesar\\'s existence, a truth already\\n2000 years old, depend for its truth on anything about to happen now?\\nHow can my acknowledgment of it be made true by the acknowledgment\\'s own\\neffects? The effects may indeed confirm my belief, but the belief was\\nmade true already by the fact that Caesar really did exist.\\'\\n\\nWell, be it so, for if there were no Caesar, there could, of course,\\nbe no positive truth about him--but then distinguish between \\'true\\' as\\nbeing positively and completely so established, and \\'true\\' as being so\\nonly \\'practically,\\' elliptically, and by courtesy, in the sense of\\nnot being positively irrelevant or UNtrue. Remember also that Caesar\\'s\\nhaving existed in fact may make a present statement false or irrelevant\\nas well as it may make it true, and that in neither case does it itself\\nhave to alter. It being given, whether truth, untruth, or irrelevancy\\nshall be also given depends on something coming from the statement\\nitself. What pragmatism contends for is that you cannot adequately\\nDEFINE the something if you leave the notion of the statement\\'s\\nfunctional workings out of your account. Truth meaning agreement with\\nreality, the mode of the agreeing is a practical problem which the\\nsubjective term of the relation alone can solve.\\n\\nNOTE. This paper was originally followed by a couple of paragraphs meant\\nto conciliate the intellectualist opposition. Since you love the word\\n\\'true\\' so, and since you despise so the concrete working of our ideas,\\nI said, keep the word \\'truth\\' for the saltatory and incomprehensible\\nrelation you care so much for, and I will say of thoughts that know\\ntheir objects in an intelligible sense that they are \\'truthful.\\'\\n\\nLike most offerings, this one has been spurned, so I revoke it,\\nrepenting of my generosity. Professor Pratt, in his recent book, calls\\nany objective state of FACTS \\'a truth,\\' and uses the word \\'trueness\\'\\nin the sense of \\'truth\\' as proposed by me. Mr. Hawtrey (see below, page\\n281) uses \\'correctness\\' in the same sense. Apart from the general evil\\nof ambiguous vocabularies, we may really forsake all hope, if the term\\n\\'truth\\' is officially to lose its status as a property of our beliefs\\nand opinions, and become recognized as a technical synonym for \\'fact.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nTHE ABSOLUTE AND THE STRENUOUS LIFE [Footnote: Reprinted from the\\nJournal of Philosophy, etc., 1906.]\\n\\nProfessor W. A. Brown, in the Journal for August 15, approves my\\npragmatism for allowing that a belief in the absolute may give\\nholidays to the spirit, but takes me to task for the narrowness of this\\nconcession, and shows by striking examples how great a power the same\\nbelief may have in letting loose the strenuous life.\\n\\nI have no criticism whatever to make upon his excellent article, but let\\nme explain why \\'moral holidays\\' were the only gift of the absolute which\\nI picked out for emphasis. I was primarily concerned in my lectures with\\ncontrasting the belief that the world is still in process of making\\nwith the belief that there is an \\'eternal\\' edition of it ready-made\\nand complete. The former, or \\'pluralistic\\' belief, was the one that my\\npragmatism favored. Both beliefs confirm our strenuous moods. Pluralism\\nactually demands them, since it makes the world\\'s salvation depend upon\\nthe energizing of its several parts, among which we are. Monism permits\\nthem, for however furious they may be, we can always justify ourselves\\nin advance for indulging them by the thought that they WILL HAVE BEEN\\nexpressions of the absolute\\'s perfect life. By escaping from your finite\\nperceptions to the conception of the eternal whole, you can hallow any\\ntendency whatever. Tho the absolute DICTATES nothing, it will SANCTION\\nanything and everything after the fact, for whatever is once there will\\nhave to be regarded as an integral member of the universe\\'s perfection.\\nQuietism and frenzy thus alike receive the absolute\\'s permit to exist.\\nThose of us who are naturally inert may abide in our resigned passivity;\\nthose whose energy is excessive may grow more reckless still. History\\nshows how easily both quietists and fanatics have drawn inspiration from\\nthe absolutistic scheme. It suits sick souls and strenuous ones equally\\nwell.\\n\\nOne cannot say thus of pluralism. Its world is always vulnerable, for\\nsome part may go astray; and having no \\'eternal\\' edition of it to draw\\ncomfort from, its partisans must always feel to some degree insecure.\\nIf, as pluralists, we grant ourselves moral holidays, they can only be\\nprovisional breathing-spells, intended to refresh us for the morrow\\'s\\nfight. This forms one permanent inferiority of pluralism from the\\npragmatic point of view. It has no saving message for incurably sick\\nsouls. Absolutism, among its other messages, has that message, and is\\nthe only scheme that has it necessarily. That constitutes its chief\\nsuperiority and is the source of its religious power. That is why,\\ndesiring to do it full justice, I valued its aptitude for moral-holiday\\ngiving so highly. Its claims in that way are unique, whereas its\\naffinities with strenuousness are less emphatic than those of the\\npluralistic scheme.\\n\\nIn the last lecture of my book I candidly admitted this inferiority of\\npluralism. It lacks the wide indifference that absolutism shows. It\\nis bound to disappoint many sick souls whom absolutism can console.\\nIt seems therefore poor tactics for absolutists to make little of this\\nadvantage. The needs of sick souls are surely the most urgent; and\\nbelievers in the absolute should rather hold it to be great merit in\\ntheir philosophy that it can meet them so well.\\n\\nThe pragmatism or pluralism which I defend has to fall back on a certain\\nultimate hardihood, a certain willingness to live without assurances or\\nguarantees. To minds thus willing to live on possibilities that are\\nnot certainties, quietistic religion, sure of salvation ANY HOW, has a\\nslight flavor of fatty degeneration about it which has caused it to be\\nlooked askance on, even in the church. Which side is right here, who can\\nsay? Within religion, emotion is apt to be tyrannical; but philosophy\\nmust favor the emotion that allies itself best with the whole body\\nand drift of all the truths in sight. I conceive this to be the more\\nstrenuous type of emotion; but I have to admit that its inability to\\nlet loose quietistic raptures is a serious deficiency in the pluralistic\\nphilosophy which I profess.\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\nPROFESSOR HEBERT ON PRAGMATISM [Footnote: Reprint from the Journal of\\nPhilosophy for December 3, 1908 (vol. v, p. 689), of a review of Le\\nPragmatisme et ses Diverses Formes Anglo-Americaines, by Marcel Hebert.\\n(Paris: Librairie critique Emile Nourry. 1908. Pp. 105.)]\\n\\nProfessor Marcel Hebert is a singularly erudite and liberal thinker\\n(a seceder, I believe, from the Catholic priesthood) and an uncommonly\\ndirect and clear writer. His book Le Divin is one of the ablest reviews\\nof the general subject of religious philosophy which recent years have\\nproduced; and in the small volume the title of which is copied above he\\nhas, perhaps, taken more pains not to do injustice to pragmatism than\\nany of its numerous critics. Yet the usual fatal misapprehension of its\\npurposes vitiates his exposition and his critique. His pamphlet seems to\\nme to form a worthy hook, as it were, on which to hang one more attempt\\nto tell the reader what the pragmatist account of truth really means.\\n\\nM. Hebert takes it to mean what most people take it to mean, the\\ndoctrine, namely, that whatever proves subjectively expedient in the way\\nof our thinking is \\'true\\' in the absolute and unrestricted sense of the\\nword, whether it corresponds to any objective state of things outside of\\nour thought or not. Assuming this to be the pragmatist thesis, M. Hebert\\nopposes it at length. Thought that proves itself to be thus expedient\\nmay, indeed, have every OTHER kind of value for the thinker, he says,\\nbut cognitive value, representative value, VALEUR DE CONNAISSANCE\\nPROPREMENT DITE, it has not; and when it does have a high degree of\\ngeneral utility value, this is in every case derived from its previous\\nvalue in the way of correctly representing independent objects that have\\nan important influence on our lives. Only by thus representing things\\ntruly do we reap the useful fruits. But the fruits follow on the truth,\\nthey do not constitute it; so M. Hebert accuses pragmatism of telling us\\neverything about truth except what it essentially is. He admits, indeed,\\nthat the world is so framed that when men have true ideas of realities,\\nconsequential utilities ensue in abundance; and no one of our critics,\\nI think, has shown as concrete a sense of the variety of these utilities\\nas he has; but he reiterates that, whereas such utilities are secondary,\\nwe insist on treating them as primary, and that the connaissance\\nobjective from which they draw all their being is something which we\\nneglect, exclude, and destroy. The utilitarian value and the strictly\\ncognitive value of our ideas may perfectly well harmonize, he says--and\\nin the main he allows that they do harmonize--but they are not logically\\nidentical for that. He admits that subjective interests, desires,\\nimpulses may even have the active \\'primacy\\' in our intellectual life.\\nCognition awakens only at their spur, and follows their cues and aims;\\nyet, when it IS awakened, it is objective cognition proper and not\\nmerely another name for the impulsive tendencies themselves in the state\\nof satisfaction. The owner of a picture ascribed to Corot gets uneasy\\nwhen its authenticity is doubted. He looks up its origin and is\\nreassured. But his uneasiness does not make the proposition false, any\\nmore than his relief makes the proposition true, that the actual Corot\\nwas the painter. Pragmatism, which, according to M. Hebert, claims that\\nour sentiments MAKE truth and falsehood, would oblige us to conclude\\nthat our minds exert no genuinely cognitive function whatever.\\n\\nThis subjectivist interpretation of our position seems to follow from my\\nhaving happened to write (without supposing it necessary to explain that\\nI was treating of cognition solely on its subjective side) that in the\\nlong run the true is the expedient in the way of our thinking, much as\\nthe good is the expedient in the way of our behavior! Having previously\\nwritten that truth means \\'agreement with reality,\\' and insisted that the\\nchief part of the expediency of any one opinion is its agreement\\nwith the rest of acknowledged truth, I apprehended no exclusively\\nsubjectivistic reading of my meaning. My mind was so filled with the\\nnotion of objective reference that I never dreamed that my hearers\\nwould let go of it; and the very last accusation I expected was that\\nin speaking of ideas and their satisfactions, I was denying realities\\noutside. My only wonder now is that critics should have found so silly\\na personage as I must have seemed in their eyes, worthy of explicit\\nrefutation.\\n\\nThe object, for me, is just as much one part of reality as the idea\\nis another part. The truth of the idea is one relation of it to the\\nreality, just as its date and its place are other relations. All three\\nrelations CONSIST of intervening parts of the universe which can in\\nevery particular case be assigned and catalogued, and which differ in\\nevery instance of truth, just as they differ with every date and place.\\n\\nThe pragmatist thesis, as Dr. Schiller and I hold it,--I prefer to let\\nProfessor Dewey speak for himself,--is that the relation called \\'truth\\'\\nis thus concretely DEFINABLE. Ours is the only articulate attempt in the\\nfield to say positively what truth actually CONSISTS OF. Our denouncers\\nhave literally nothing to oppose to it as an alternative. For them, when\\nan idea is true, it IS true, and there the matter terminates; the word\\n\\'true\\' being indefinable. The relation of the true idea to its object,\\nbeing, as they think, unique, it can be expressed in terms of nothing\\nelse, and needs only to be named for any one to recognize and understand\\nit. Moreover it is invariable and universal, the same in every single\\ninstance of truth, however diverse the ideas, the realities, and the\\nother relations between them may be.\\n\\nOur pragmatist view, on the contrary, is that the truth-relation is a\\ndefinitely experienceable relation, and therefore describable as well\\nas namable; that it is not unique in kind, and neither invariable nor\\nuniversal. The relation to its object that makes an idea true in any\\ngiven instance, is, we say, embodied in intermediate details of reality\\nwhich lead towards the object, which vary in every instance, and which\\nin every instance can be concretely traced. The chain of workings which\\nan opinion sets up IS the opinion\\'s truth, falsehood, or irrelevancy,\\nas the case may be. Every idea that a man has works some consequences\\nin him, in the shape either of bodily actions or of other ideas. Through\\nthese consequences the man\\'s relations to surrounding realities are\\nmodified. He is carried nearer to some of them and farther from others,\\nand gets now the feeling that the idea has worked satisfactorily, now\\nthat it has not. The idea has put him into touch with something that\\nfulfils its intent, or it has not.\\n\\nThis something is the MAN\\'S OBJECT, primarily. Since the only realities\\nwe can talk about are such OBJECTS-BELIEVED-IN, the pragmatist, whenever\\nhe says \\'reality,\\' means in the first instance what may count for the\\nman himself as a reality, what he believes at the moment to be such.\\nSometimes the reality is a concrete sensible presence. The idea, for\\nexample, may be that a certain door opens into a room where a glass of\\nbeer may be bought. If opening the door leads to the actual sight and\\ntaste of the beer, the man calls the idea true. Or his idea may be\\nthat of an abstract relation, say of that between the sides and the\\nhypothenuse of a triangle, such a relation being, of course, a reality\\nquite as much as a glass of beer is. If the thought of such a relation\\nleads him to draw auxiliary lines and to compare the figures they make,\\nhe may at last, perceiving one equality after another, SEE the relation\\nthought of, by a vision quite as particular and direct as was the taste\\nof the beer. If he does so, he calls THAT idea, also, true. His idea\\nhas, in each case, brought him into closer touch with a reality felt at\\nthe moment to verify just that idea. Each reality verifies and validates\\nits own idea exclusively; and in each case the verification consists in\\nthe satisfactorily-ending consequences, mental or physical, which\\nthe idea was able to set up. These \\'workings\\' differ in every single\\ninstance, they never transcend experience, they consist of particulars,\\nmental or sensible, and they admit of concrete description in every\\nindividual case. Pragmatists are unable to see what you can possibly\\nMEAN by calling an idea true, unless you mean that between it as a\\nterminus a quo in some one\\'s mind and some particular reality as a\\nterminus ad quem, such concrete workings do or may intervene. Their\\ndirection constitutes the idea\\'s reference to that reality, their\\nsatisfactoriness constitutes its adaptation thereto, and the two things\\ntogether constitute the \\'truth\\' of the idea for its possessor.\\nWithout such intermediating portions of concretely real experience the\\npragmatist sees no materials out of which the adaptive relation called\\ntruth can be built up.\\n\\nThe anti-pragmatist view is that the workings are but evidences of the\\ntruth\\'s previous inherent presence in the idea, and that you can wipe\\nthe very possibility of them out of existence and still leave the truth\\nof the idea as solid as ever. But surely this is not a counter-theory\\nof truth to ours. It is the renunciation of all articulate theory. It is\\nbut a claim to the right to call certain ideas true anyhow; and this is\\nwhat I meant above by saying that the anti-pragmatists offer us no real\\nalternative, and that our account is literally the only positive theory\\nextant. What meaning, indeed, can an idea\\'s truth have save its power of\\nadapting us either mentally or physically to a reality?\\n\\nHow comes it, then, that our critics so uniformly accuse us of\\nsubjectivism, of denying the reality\\'s existence? It comes, I think,\\nfrom the necessary predominance of subjective language in our analysis.\\nHowever independent and elective realities may be, we can talk about\\nthem, in framing our accounts of truth, only as so many objects\\nbelieved-in. But the process of experience leads men so continually\\nto supersede their older objects by newer ones which they find it more\\nsatisfactory to believe in, that the notion of an ABSOLUTE reality\\ninevitably arises as a grenzbegriff, equivalent to that of an object\\nthat shall never be superseded, and belief in which shall be endgueltig.\\nCognitively we thus live under a sort of rule of three: as our private\\nconcepts represent the sense-objects to which they lead us, these being\\npublic realities independent of the individual, so these sense-realities\\nmay, in turn, represent realities of a hypersensible order, electrons,\\nmind-stuff. God, or what not, existing independently of all human\\nthinkers. The notion of such final realities, knowledge of which would\\nbe absolute truth, is an outgrowth of our cognitive experience from\\nwhich neither pragmatists nor anti-pragmatists escape. They form an\\ninevitable regulative postulate in every one\\'s thinking. Our notion of\\nthem is the most abundantly suggested and satisfied of all our beliefs,\\nthe last to suffer doubt. The difference is that our critics use this\\nbelief as their sole paradigm, and treat any one who talks of\\nhuman realities as if he thought the notion of reality \\'in itself\\'\\nillegitimate. Meanwhile, reality-in-itself, so far as by them TALKED OF,\\nis only a human object; they postulate it just as we postulate it; and\\nif we are subjectivists they are so no less. Realities in themselves\\ncan be there FOR any one, whether pragmatist or anti-pragmatist, only by\\nbeing believed; they are believed only by their notions appearing true;\\nand their notions appear true only because they work satisfactorily.\\nSatisfactorily, moreover, for the particular thinker\\'s purpose. There is\\nno idea which is THE true idea, of anything. Whose is THE true idea of\\nthe absolute? Or to take M. Hebert\\'s example, what is THE true idea of a\\npicture which you possess? It is the idea that most satisfactorily meets\\nyour present interest. The interest may be in the picture\\'s place, its\\nage, its \\'tone,\\' its subject, its dimensions, its authorship, its price,\\nits merit, or what not. If its authorship by Corot have been doubted,\\nwhat will satisfy the interest aroused in you at that moment will be\\nto have your claim to own a Corot confirmed; but, if you have a normal\\nhuman mind, merely calling it a Corot will not satisfy other demands of\\nyour mind at the same time. For THEM to be satisfied, what you learn of\\nthe picture must make smooth connection with what you know of the rest\\nof the system of reality in which the actual Corot played his part.\\nM. Hebert accuses us of holding that the proprietary satisfactions of\\nthemselves suffice to make the belief true, and that, so far as we are\\nconcerned, no actual Corot need ever have existed. Why we should be thus\\ncut off from the more general and intellectual satisfactions, I know\\nnot; but whatever the satisfactions may be, intellectual or proprietary,\\nthey belong to the subjective side of the truth-relation. They found our\\nbeliefs; our beliefs are in realities; if no realities are there, the\\nbeliefs are false but if realities are there, how they can even be KNOWN\\nwithout first being BELIEVED; or how BELIEVED except by our first having\\nideas of them that work satisfactorily, pragmatists find it impossible\\nto imagine. They also find it impossible to imagine what makes the\\nanti-pragmatists\\' dogmatic \\'ipse dixit\\' assurance of reality\\nmore credible than the pragmatists conviction based on concrete\\nverifications. M. Hebert will probably agree to this, when put in\\nthis way, so I do not see our inferiority to him in the matter of\\nconnaissance proprement dite.\\n\\nSome readers will say that, altho I may possibly believe in realities\\nbeyond our ideas Dr. Schiller, at any rate, does not. This is a great\\nmisunderstanding, for Schiller\\'s doctrine and mine are identical,\\nonly our exposition follow different directions. He starts from the\\nsubjective pole of the chain, the individual with his beliefs, as the\\nmore concrete and immediately given phenomenon. \\'An individual claims\\nhis belief to be true,\\' Schiller says, \\'but what does he mean by true?\\nand how does he establish the claim?\\' With these questions we embark\\non a psychological inquiry. To be true, it appears, means, FOR THAT\\nINDIVIDUAL, to work satisfactorily for him; and the working and the\\nsatisfaction, since they vary from case to case, admit of no universal\\ndescription. What works is true and represents a reality, for the\\nindividual for whom it works. If he is infallible, the reality is\\n\\'really\\' there; if mistaken it is not there, or not there as he thinks\\nit. We all believe, when our ideas work satisfactorily; but we don\\'t yet\\nknow who of us is infallible; so that the problem of truth and that of\\nerror are EBENBURTIG and arise out of the same situations. Schiller,\\nremaining with the fallible individual, and treating only\\nof reality-for-him, seems to many of his readers to ignore\\nreality-in-itself altogether. But that is because he seeks only to tell\\nus how truths are attained, not what the content of those truths, when\\nattained, shall be. It may be that the truest of all beliefs shall be\\nthat in transsubjective realities. It certainly SEEMS the truest for\\nno rival belief is as voluminously satisfactory, and it is probably\\nDr. Schiller\\'s own belief; but he is not required, for his immediate\\npurpose, to profess it. Still less is he obliged to assume it in advance\\nas the basis of his discussion.\\n\\nI, however, warned by the ways of critics, adopt different tactics. I\\nstart from the object-pole of the idea-reality chain and follow it in\\nthe opposite direction from Schiller\\'s. Anticipating the results of the\\ngeneral truth-processes of mankind, I begin with the abstract notion\\nof an objective reality. I postulate it, and ask on my own account, I\\nVOUCHING FOR THIS REALITY, what would make any one else\\'s idea of it\\ntrue for me as well as for him. But I find no different answer from that\\nwhich Schiller gives. If the other man\\'s idea leads him, not only\\nto believe that the reality is there, but to use it as the reality\\'s\\ntemporary substitute, by letting it evoke adaptive thoughts and acts\\nsimilar to those which the reality itself would provoke, then it is\\ntrue in the only intelligible sense, true through its particular\\nconsequences, and true for me as well as for the man.\\n\\nMy account is more of a logical definition; Schiller\\'s is more of a\\npsychological description. Both treat an absolutely identical matter of\\nexperience, only they traverse it in opposite ways.\\n\\nPossibly these explanations may satisfy M. Hebert, whose little\\nbook, apart from the false accusation of subjectivism, gives a fairly\\ninstructive account of the pragmatist epistemology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nABSTRACTIONISM AND \\'RELATIVISMUS\\'\\n\\nAbstract concepts, such as elasticity, voluminousness, disconnectedness,\\nare salient aspects of our concrete experiences which we find it useful\\nto single out. Useful, because we are then reminded of other things\\nthat offer those same aspects; and, if the aspects carry consequences in\\nthose other things, we can return to our first things, expecting those\\nsame consequences to accrue.\\n\\nTo be helped to anticipate consequences is always a gain, and such being\\nthe help that abstract concepts give us, it is obvious that their use is\\nfulfilled only when we get back again into concrete particulars by their\\nmeans, bearing the consequences in our minds, and enriching our notion\\nof the original objects therewithal.\\n\\nWithout abstract concepts to handle our perceptual particulars by,\\nwe are like men hopping on one foot. Using concepts along with the\\nparticulars, we become bipedal. We throw our concept forward, get\\na foothold on the consequence, hitch our line to this, and draw our\\npercept up, travelling thus with a hop, skip and jump over the surface\\nof life at a vastly rapider rate than if we merely waded through the\\nthickness of the particulars as accident rained them down upon our\\nheads. Animals have to do this, but men raise their heads higher and\\nbreathe freely in the upper conceptual air.\\n\\nThe enormous esteem professed by all philosophers for the\\nconceptual form of consciousness is easy to understand. From Plato\\'s\\ntime downwards it has been held to be our sole avenue to essential\\ntruth. Concepts are universal, changeless, pure; their relations are\\neternal; they are spiritual, while the concrete particulars which they\\nenable us to handle are corrupted by the flesh. They are precious in\\nthemselves, then, apart from their original use, and confer new dignity\\nupon our life.\\n\\nOne can find no fault with this way of feeling about concepts so long as\\ntheir original function does not get swallowed up in the admiration\\nand lost. That function is of course to enlarge mentally our momentary\\nexperiences by ADDING to them the consequences conceived; but\\nunfortunately, that function is not only too often forgotten by\\nphilosophers in their reasonings, but is often converted into its exact\\nopposite, and made a means of diminishing the original experience\\nby DENYING (implicitly or explicitly) all its features save the one\\nspecially abstracted to conceive it by.\\n\\nThis itself is a highly abstract way of stating my complaint, and it\\nneeds to be redeemed from obscurity by showing instances of what is\\nmeant. Some beliefs very dear to my own heart have been conceived in\\nthis viciously abstract way by critics. One is the \\'will to believe,\\' so\\ncalled; another is the indeterminism of certain futures; a third is the\\nnotion that truth may vary with the standpoint of the man who holds it.\\nI believe that the perverse abuse of the abstracting function has led\\ncritics to employ false arguments against these doctrines, and often has\\nled their readers to false conclusions. I should like to try to save the\\nsituation, if possible, by a few counter-critical remarks.\\n\\nLet me give the name of \\'vicious abstractionism\\' to a way of using\\nconcepts which may be thus described: We conceive a concrete situation\\nby singling out some salient or important feature in it, and classing it\\nunder that; then, instead of adding to its previous characters all the\\npositive consequences which the new way of conceiving it may bring, we\\nproceed to use our concept privatively; reducing the originally rich\\nphenomenon to the naked suggestions of that name abstractly taken,\\ntreating it as a case of \\'nothing but\\' that concept, and acting as if\\nall the other characters from out of which the concept is abstracted\\nwere expunged. [Footnote: Let not the reader confound the fallacy here\\ndescribed with legitimately negative inferences such as those drawn in\\nthe mood \\'celarent\\' of the logic-books.] Abstraction, functioning in\\nthis way, becomes a means of arrest far more than a means of advance\\nin thought. It mutilates things; it creates difficulties and finds\\nimpossibilities; and more than half the trouble that metaphysicians and\\nlogicians give themselves over the paradoxes and dialectic puzzles of\\nthe universe may, I am convinced, be traced to this relatively simple\\nsource. THE VICIOUSLY PRIVATIVE EMPLOYMENT OF ABSTRACT CHARACTERS AND\\nCLASS NAMES is, I am persuaded, one of the great original sins of the\\nrationalistic mind.\\n\\nTo proceed immediately to concrete examples, cast a glance at the belief\\nin \\'free will,\\' demolished with such specious persuasiveness recently\\nby the skilful hand of Professor Fullerton. [Footnote: Popular Science\\nMonthly, N. Y., vols. lviii and lix.] When a common man says that his\\nwill is free, what does he mean? He means that there are situations of\\nbifurcation inside of his life in which two futures seem to him equally\\npossible, for both have their roots equally planted in his present and\\nhis past. Either, if realized, will grow out of his previous motives,\\ncharacter and circumstances, and will continue uninterruptedly the\\npulsations of his personal life. But sometimes both at once are\\nincompatible with physical nature, and then it seems to the naive\\nobserver as if he made a choice between them NOW, and that the question\\nof which future is to be, instead of having been decided at the\\nfoundation of the world, were decided afresh at every passing moment in\\nI which fact seems livingly to grow, and possibility seems, in turning\\nitself towards one act, to exclude all others.\\n\\nHe who takes things at their face-value here may indeed be deceived. He\\nmay far too often mistake his private ignorance of what is predetermined\\nfor a real indetermination of what is to be. Yet, however imaginary\\nit may be, his picture of the situation offers no appearance of breach\\nbetween the past and future. A train is the same train, its passengers\\nare the same passengers, its momentum is the same momentum, no matter\\nwhich way the switch which fixes its direction is placed. For the\\nindeterminist there is at all times enough past for all the different\\nfutures in sight, and more besides, to find their reasons in it, and\\nwhichever future comes will slide out of that past as easily as the\\ntrain slides by the switch. The world, in short, is just as CONTINUOUS\\nWITH ITSELF for the believers in free will as for the rigorous\\ndeterminists, only the latter are unable to believe in points of\\nbifurcation as spots of really indifferent equilibrium or as containing\\nshunts which there--and there only, NOT BEFORE--direct existing motions\\nwithout altering their amount.\\n\\nWere there such spots of indifference, the rigorous determinists think,\\nthe future and the past would be separated absolutely, for, ABSTRACTLY\\nTAKEN, THE WORD \\'INDIFFERENT\\' SUGGESTS DISCONNECTION SOLELY. Whatever\\nis indifferent is in so far forth unrelated and detached. Take the\\nterm thus strictly, and you see, they tell us, that if any spot of\\nindifference is found upon the broad highway between the past and the\\nfuture, then no connection of any sort whatever, no continuous momentum,\\nno identical passenger, no common aim or agent, can be found on both\\nsides of the shunt or switch which there is moved. The place is an\\nimpassable chasm.\\n\\nMr. Fullerton writes--the italics are mine--as follows:--\\n\\n\\'In so far as my action is free, what I have been, what I am, what I\\nhave always done or striven to do, what I most earnestly wish or resolve\\nto do at the present moment--these things can have NO MORE TO DO WITH\\nITS FUTURE REALIZATION THAN IF THEY HAD NO EXISTENCE.... The possibility\\nis a hideous one; and surely even the most ardent free-willist will,\\nwhen he contemplates it frankly, excuse me for hoping that if I am free\\nI am at least not very free, and that I may reasonably expect to find\\nSOME degree of consistency in my life and actions. ... Suppose that I\\nhave given a dollar to a blind beggar. Can I, if it is really an act\\nof free-will, be properly said to have given the money? Was it given\\nbecause I was a man of tender heart, etc., etc.? ... What has all\\nthis to do with acts of free-will? If they are free, they must not be\\nconditioned by antecedent circumstances of any sort, by the misery of\\nthe beggar, by the pity in the heart of the passer-by. They must be\\ncauseless, not determined. They must drop from a clear sky out of the\\nvoid, for just in so far as they can be accounted for, they are not\\nfree.\\' [Footnote: Loc. cit., vol. lviii, pp. 189, 188.]\\n\\nHeaven forbid that I should get entangled here in a controversy about\\nthe rights and wrongs of the free-will question at large, for I am only\\ntrying to illustrate vicious abstractionism by the conduct of some\\nof the doctrine\\'s assailants. The moments of bifurcation, as the\\nindeterminist seems to himself to experience them, are moments both of\\nre-direction and of continuation. But because in the \\'either--or\\' of the\\nre-direction we hesitate, the determinist abstracts this little element\\nof discontinuity from the superabundant continuities of the experience,\\nand cancels in its behalf all the connective characters with which the\\nlatter is filled. Choice, for him, means henceforward DISconnection pure\\nand simple, something undetermined in advance IN ANY RESPECT WHATEVER,\\nand a life of choices must be a raving chaos, at no two moments of which\\ncould we be treated as one and the same man. If Nero were \\'free\\' at. the\\nmoment of ordering his mother\\'s murder, Mr. McTaggart [Footnote: Some\\nDogmas of Religion, p. 179.] assures us that no one would have the\\nright at any other moment to call him a bad man, for he would then be an\\nabsolutely other Nero.\\n\\nA polemic author ought not merely to destroy his victim. He ought to try\\na bit to make him feel his error--perhaps not enough to convert him,\\nbut enough to give him a bad conscience and to weaken the energy of his\\ndefence. These violent caricatures of men\\'s beliefs arouse only contempt\\nfor the incapacity of their authors to see the situations out of which\\nthe problems grow. To treat the negative character of one abstracted\\nelement as annulling all the positive features with which it coexists,\\nis no way to change any actual indeterminist\\'s way of looking on the\\nmatter, tho it may make the gallery applaud.\\n\\nTurn now to some criticisms of the \\'will to believe,\\' as another example\\nof the vicious way in which abstraction is currently employed. The right\\nto believe in things for the truth of which complete objective proof is\\nyet lacking is defended by those who apprehend certain human situations\\nin their concreteness. In those situations the mind has alternatives\\nbefore it so vast that the full evidence for either branch is missing,\\nand yet so significant that simply to wait for proof, and to doubt while\\nwaiting, might often in practical respects be the same thing as weighing\\ndown the negative side. Is life worth while at all? Is there any general\\nmeaning in all this cosmic weather? Is anything being permanently bought\\nby all this suffering? Is there perhaps a transmundane experience in\\nBeing, something corresponding to a \\'fourth dimension,\\' which, if we had\\naccess to it, might patch up some of this world\\'s zerrissenheit and\\nmake things look more rational than they at first appear? Is there a\\nsuperhuman consciousness of which our minds are parts, and from which\\ninspiration and help may come? Such are the questions in which the right\\nto take sides practically for yes or no is affirmed by some of us, while\\nothers hold that this is methodologically inadmissible, and summon us to\\ndie professing ignorance and proclaiming the duty of every one to refuse\\nto believe.\\n\\nI say nothing of the personal inconsistency of some of these critics,\\nwhose printed works furnish exquisite illustrations of the will to\\nbelieve, in spite of their denunciations of it as a phrase and as a\\nrecommended thing. Mr. McTaggart, whom I will once more take as an\\nexample, is sure that \\'reality is rational and righteous\\' and \\'destined\\nsub specie temporis to become perfectly good\\'; and his calling this\\nbelief a result of necessary logic has surely never deceived any reader\\nas to its real genesis in the gifted author\\'s mind. Mankind is made on\\ntoo uniform a pattern for any of us to escape successfully from acts of\\nfaith. We have a lively vision of what a certain view of the universe\\nwould mean for us. We kindle or we shudder at the thought, and our\\nfeeling runs through our whole logical nature and animates its workings.\\nIt CAN\\'T be that, we feel; it MUST be this. It must be what it OUGHT\\nto be, and OUGHT to be this; and then we seek for every reason, good\\nor bad, to make this which so deeply ought to be, seem objectively the\\nprobable thing. We show the arguments against it to be insufficient, so\\nthat it MAY be true; we represent its appeal to be to our whole nature\\'s\\nloyalty and not to any emaciated faculty of syllogistic proof. We\\nreinforce it by remembering the enlargement of our world by music, by\\nthinking of the promises of sunsets and the impulses from vernal woods.\\nAnd the essence of the whole experience, when the individual swept\\nthrough it says finally \\'I believe,\\' is the intense concreteness of\\nhis vision, the individuality of the hypothesis before him, and the\\ncomplexity of the various concrete motives and perceptions that issue in\\nhis final state.\\n\\nBut see now how the abstractionist treats this rich and intricate vision\\nthat a certain state of things must be true. He accuses the believer of\\nreasoning by the following syllogism:--\\n\\nAll good desires must be fulfilled; The desire to believe this\\nproposition is a good desire;\\n\\nErgo, this proposition must be believed.\\n\\nHe substitutes this abstraction for the concrete state of mind of the\\nbeliever, pins the naked absurdity of it upon him, and easily proves\\nthat any one who defends him must be the greatest fool on earth. As if\\nany real believer ever thought in this preposterous way, or as if any\\ndefender of the legitimacy of men\\'s concrete ways of concluding ever\\nused the abstract and general premise, \\'All desires must be fulfilled\\'!\\nNevertheless, Mr. McTaggart solemnly and laboriously refutes the\\nsyllogism in sections 47 to 57 of the above-cited book. He shows that\\nthere is no fixed link in the dictionary between the abstract concepts\\n\\'desire,\\' \\'goodness\\' and \\'reality\\'; and he ignores all the links which\\nin the single concrete case the believer feels and perceives to be\\nthere! He adds:--\\n\\n\\'When the reality of a thing is uncertain, the argument encourages us to\\nsuppose that our approval of a thing can determine its reality. And when\\nthis unhallowed link has once been established, retribution overtakes\\nus. For when the reality of the thing is independently certain, we\\n[then] have to admit that the reality of the thing should determine our\\napproval of that thing. I find it difficult to imagine a more degraded\\nposition.\\'\\n\\nOne here feels tempted to quote ironically Hegel\\'s famous equation of\\nthe real with the rational to his english disciple, who ends his chapter\\nwith the heroic words:--\\n\\n\\'For those who do not pray, there remains the resolve that, so far as\\ntheir strength may permit, neither the pains of death nor the pains\\nof life shall drive them to any comfort in that which they hold to be\\nfalse, or drive them from any comfort [discomfort?] in that which they\\nhold to be true.\\'\\n\\nHow can so ingenious-minded a writer fail to see how far over the heads\\nof the enemy all his arrows pass? When Mr. McTaggart himself believes\\nthat the universe is run by the dialectic energy of the absolute idea,\\nhis insistent desire to have a world of that sort is felt by him to\\nbe no chance example of desire in general, but an altogether peculiar\\ninsight-giving passion to which, in this if in no other instance, he\\nwould be stupid not to yield. He obeys its concrete singularity, not\\nthe bare abstract feature in it of being a \\'desire.\\' His situation is as\\nparticular as that of an actress who resolves that it is best for her\\nto marry and leave the stage, of a priest who becomes secular, of a\\npolitician who abandons public life. What sensible man would seek\\nto refute the concrete decisions of such persons by tracing them\\nto abstract premises, such as that \\'all actresses must marry,\\' \\'all\\nclergymen must be laymen,\\' \\'all politicians should resign their posts\\'?\\nYet this type of refutation, absolutely unavailing though it be for\\npurposes of conversion, is spread by Mr. McTaggart through many pages of\\nhis book. For the aboundingness of our real reasons he substitutes\\none narrow point. For men\\'s real probabilities he gives a skeletonized\\nabstraction which no man was ever tempted to believe.\\n\\nThe abstraction in my next example is less simple, but is quite as\\nflimsy as a weapon of attack. Empiricists think that truth in general is\\ndistilled from single men\\'s beliefs; and the so-called pragmatists \\'go\\nthem one better\\' by trying to define what it consists in when it comes.\\nIt consists, I have elsewhere said, in such a working on the part of the\\nbeliefs as may bring the man into satisfactory relations with objects to\\nwhich these latter point. The working is of course a concrete working\\nin the actual experience of human beings, among their ideas, feelings,\\nperceptions, beliefs and acts, as well as among the physical things\\nof their environment, and the relations must be understood as being\\npossible as well as actual. In the chapter on truth of my book\\nPragmatism I have taken pains to defend energetically this view. Strange\\nindeed have been the misconceptions of it by its enemies, and many have\\nthese latter been. Among the most formidable-sounding onslaughts on the\\nattempt to introduce some concreteness into our notion of what the truth\\nof an idea may mean, is one that has been raised in many quarters to the\\neffect that to make truth grow in any way out of human opinion is but\\nto reproduce that protagorean doctrine that the individual man is\\n\\'the measure of all things,\\' which Plato in his immortal dialogue, the\\nThaeatetus, is unanimously said to have laid away so comfortably in\\nits grave two thousand years ago. The two cleverest brandishers of this\\nobjection to make truth concrete, Professors Rickert and Munsterberg,\\nwrite in German, [Footnote: Munsterberg\\'s book has just appeared in an\\nEnglish version: The Eternal Values, Boston, 1909.] and \\'relativismus\\'\\nis the name they give to the heresy which they endeavor to uproot.\\n\\nThe first step in their campaign against \\'relativismus\\' is entirely\\nin the air. They accuse relativists--and we pragmatists are typical\\nrelativists--of being debarred by their self-adopted principles,\\nnot only from the privilege which rationalist philosophers enjoy, of\\nbelieving that these principles of their own are truth impersonal and\\nabsolute, but even of framing the abstract notion of such a truth, in\\nthe pragmatic sense, of an ideal opinion in which all men might agree,\\nand which no man should ever wish to change. Both charges fall wide\\nof their mark. I myself, as a pragmatist, believe in my own account of\\ntruth as firmly as any rationalist can possibly believe in his. And I\\nbelieve in it for the very reason that I have the idea of truth which\\nmy learned adversaries contend that no pragmatist can frame. I expect,\\nnamely, that the more fully men discuss and test my account, the more\\nthey will agree that it fits, and the less will they desire a change.\\nI may of course be premature in this confidence, and the glory of\\nbeing truth final and absolute may fall upon some later revision and\\ncorrection of my scheme, which later will then be judged untrue in\\njust the measure in which it departs from that finally satisfactory\\nformulation. To admit, as we pragmatists do, that we are liable to\\ncorrection (even tho we may not expect it) involves the use on our\\npart of an ideal standard. Rationalists themselves are, as individuals,\\nsometimes sceptical enough to admit the abstract possibility of their\\nown present opinions being corrigible and revisable to some degree, so\\nthe fact that the mere NOTION of an absolute standard should seem to\\nthem so important a thing to claim for themselves and to deny to us is\\nnot easy to explain. If, along with the notion of the standard, they\\ncould also claim its exclusive warrant for their own fulminations now,\\nit would be important to them indeed. But absolutists like Rickert\\nfreely admit the sterility of the notion, even in their own hands. Truth\\nis what we OUGHT to believe, they say, even tho no man ever did or shall\\nbelieve it, and even tho we have no way of getting at it save by the\\nusual empirical processes of testing our opinions by one another and\\nby facts. Pragmatically, then, this part of the dispute is idle. No\\nrelativist who ever actually walked the earth [Footnote: Of course\\nthe bugaboo creature called \\'the sceptic\\' in the logic-books, who\\ndogmatically makes the statement that no statement, not even the one he\\nnow makes, is true, is a mere mechanical toy--target for the rationalist\\nshooting-gallery--hit him and he turns a summersault--yet he is the only\\nsort of relativist whom my colleagues appear able to imagine to exist.]\\nhas denied the regulative character in his own thinking of the notion of\\nabsolute truth. What is challenged by relativists is the pretence on any\\none\\'s part to have found for certain at any given moment what the shape\\nof that truth is. Since the better absolutists agree in this, admitting\\nthat the proposition \\'There is absolute truth\\' is the only absolute\\ntruth of which we can be sure, [Footnote: Compare Bickert\\'s Gegenstand\\nder Erkentniss, pp. 187, 138. Munsterberg\\'s version of this first truth\\nis that \\'Es gibt eine Welt,\\'--see his Philosophie der Werte, pp. 38 and\\n74 And, after all, both these philosophers confess in the end that the\\nprimal truth of which they consider our supposed denial so irrational\\nis not properly an insight at all, but a dogma adopted by the will which\\nany one who turns his back on duty may disregard! But if it all reverts\\nto \\'the will to believe,\\' pragmatists have that privilege as well as\\ntheir critics.] further debate is practically unimportant, so we may\\npass to their next charge.\\n\\nIt is in this charge that the vicious abstractionism becomes most\\napparent. The antipragmatist, in postulating absolute truth, refuses\\nto give any account of what the words may mean. For him they form a\\nself-explanatory term. The pragmatist, on the contrary, articulately\\ndefines their meaning. Truth absolute, he says, means an ideal set\\nof formulations towards which all opinions may in the long run of\\nexperience be expected to converge. In this definition of absolute truth\\nhe not only postulates that there is a tendency to such convergence\\nof opinions, to such ultimate consensus, but he postulates the other\\nfactors of his definition equally, borrowing them by anticipation from\\nthe true conclusions expected to be reached. He postulates the existence\\nof opinions, he postulates the experience that will sift them, and the\\nconsistency which that experience will show. He justifies himself in\\nthese assumptions by saying that they are not postulates in the strict\\nsense but simple inductions from the past extended to the future by\\nanalogy; and he insists that human opinion has already reached a pretty\\nstable equilibrium regarding them, and that if its future development\\nfails to alter them, the definition itself, with all its terms included,\\nwill be part of the very absolute truth which it defines. The hypothesis\\nwill, in short, have worked successfully all round the circle and proved\\nself-corroborative, and the circle will be closed.\\n\\nThe anti-pragmatist, however, immediately falls foul of the word\\n\\'opinion\\' here, abstracts it from the universe of life, and uses it as\\na bare dictionary-substantive, to deny the rest of the assumptions which\\nit coexists withal. The dictionary says that an opinion is \\'what some\\none thinks or believes.\\' This definition leaves every one\\'s opinion free\\nto be autogenous, or unrelated either to what any one else may think or\\nto what the truth may be.\\n\\nTherefore, continue our abstractionists, we must conceive it as\\nessentially thus unrelated, so that even were a billion men to sport the\\nsame opinion, and only one man to differ, we could admit no collateral\\ncircumstances which might presumptively make it more probable that he,\\nnot they, should be wrong. Truth, they say, follows not the counting of\\nnoses, nor is it only another name for a majority vote. It is a relation\\nthat antedates experience, between our opinions and an independent\\nsomething which the pragmatist account ignores, a relation which, tho\\nthe opinions of individuals should to all eternity deny it, would still\\nremain to qualify them as false. To talk of opinions without referring\\nto this independent something, the anti-pragmatist assures us, is to\\nplay Hamlet with Hamlet\\'s part left out.\\n\\nBut when the pragmatist speaks of opinions, does he mean any such\\ninsulated and unmotived abstractions as are here supposed? Of course\\nnot, he means men\\'s opinions in the flesh, as they have really formed\\nthemselves, opinions surrounded by their causes and the influences\\nthey obey and exert, and along with the whole environment of social\\ncommunication of which they are a part and out of which they take\\ntheir rise. Moreover the \\'experience\\' which the pragmatic definition\\npostulates is the independent something which the anti-pragmatist\\naccuses him of ignoring. Already have men grown unanimous in the opinion\\nthat such experience is of an independent reality, the existence of\\nwhich all opinions must acknowledge, in order to be true. Already do\\nthey agree that in the long run it is useless to resist experience\\'s\\npressure; that the more of it a man has, the better position he stands\\nin, in respect of truth; that some men, having had more experience, are\\ntherefore better authorities than others; that some are also wiser by\\nnature and better able to interpret the experience they have had; that\\nit is one part of such wisdom to compare notes, discuss, and follow the\\nopinion of our betters; and that the more systematically and thoroughly\\nsuch comparison and weighing of opinions is pursued, the truer the\\nopinions that survive are likely to be. When the pragmatist talks\\nof opinions, it is opinions as they thus concretely and livingly and\\ninteractingly and correlatively exist that he has in mind; and when the\\nanti-pragmatist tries to floor him because the word \\'opinion\\' can also\\nbe taken abstractly and as if it had no environment, he simply ignores\\nthe soil out of which the whole discussion grows. His weapons cut\\nthe air and strike no blow. No one gets wounded in the war against\\ncaricatures of belief and skeletons of opinion of which the German\\nonslaughts upon \\'relativismus\\' consists. Refuse to use the word\\n\\'opinion\\' abstractly, keep it in its real environment, and the withers\\nof pragmatism remain unwrung. That men do exist who are \\'opinionated,\\'\\nin the sense that their opinions are self-willed, is unfortunately a\\nfact that must be admitted, no matter what one\\'s notion of truth in\\ngeneral may be. But that this fact should make it impossible for truth\\nto form itself authentically out of the life of opinion is what no\\ncritic has yet proved. Truth may well consist of certain opinions, and\\ndoes indeed consist of nothing but opinions, tho not every opinion need\\nbe true. No pragmatist needs to dogmatize about the consensus of opinion\\nin the future being right--he need only postulate that it will probably\\ncontain more of truth than any one\\'s opinion now.\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nTWO ENGLISH CRITICS\\n\\nMr. Bertrand Russell\\'s article entitled \\'Transatlantic Truth,\\'\\n[Footnote: In the Albany Review for January, 1908.] has all the\\nclearness, dialectic subtlety, and wit which one expects from his pen,\\nbut it entirely fails to hit the right point of view for apprehending\\nour position. When, for instance, we say that a true proposition is one\\nthe consequences of believing which are good, he assumes us to mean that\\nany one who believes a proposition to be true must first have made\\nout clearly that its consequences be good, and that his belief must\\nprimarily be in that fact,--an obvious absurdity, for that fact is the\\ndeliverance of a new proposition, quite different from the first one and\\nis, moreover, a fact usually very hard to verify, it being \\'far easier,\\'\\nas Mr. Russell justly says, \\'to settle the plain question of fact: \"Have\\npopes always been infallible?\"\\' than to settle the question whether the\\neffects of thinking them infallible are on the whole good.\\'\\n\\nWe affirm nothing as silly as Mr. Russell supposes. Good consequences\\nare not proposed by us merely as a sure sign, mark, or criterion, by\\nwhich truth\\'s presence is habitually ascertained, tho they may indeed\\nserve on occasion as such a sign; they are proposed rather as the\\nlurking motive inside of every truth-claim, whether the \\'trower\\' be\\nconscious of such motive, or whether he obey it blindly. They are\\nproposed as the causa existendi of our beliefs, not as their logical cue\\nor premise, and still less as their objective deliverance or content.\\nThey assign the only intelligible practical meaning to that difference\\nin our beliefs which our habit of calling them true or false comports.\\n\\nNo truth-claimer except the pragmatist himself need ever be aware of the\\npart played in his own mind by consequences, and he himself is aware\\nof it only abstractly and in general, and may at any moment be quite\\noblivious of it with respect to his own beliefs.\\n\\nMr. Russell next joins the army of those who inform their readers that\\naccording to the pragmatist definition of the word \\'truth\\' the belief\\nthat A exists may be \\'true\\' even when A does not exist. This is the\\nusual slander repeated to satiety by our critics. They forget that in\\nany concrete account of what is denoted by \\'truth\\' in human life, the\\nword can only be used relatively to some particular trower. Thus, I may\\nhold it true that Shakespeare wrote the plays that bear his name, and\\nmay express my opinion to a critic. If the critic be both a pragmatist\\nand a baconian, he will in his capacity of pragmatist see plain that the\\nworkings of my opinion, I being who I am, make it perfectly true for\\nme, while in his capacity of baconian he still believes that Shakespeare\\nnever wrote the plays in question. But most anti-pragmatist critics\\ntake the wont \\'truth\\' as something absolute, and easily play on their\\nreader\\'s readiness to treat his OWE truths as the absolute ones. If\\nthe reader whom they address believes that A does not exist, while we\\npragmatists show that those for whom tho belief that it exists works\\nsatisfactorily will always call it true, he easily sneers at the naivete\\nof our contention, for is not then the belief in question \\'true,\\' tho\\nwhat it declares as fact has, as the reader so well knows, no existence?\\nMr. Russell speaks of our statement as an \\'attempt to get rid of fact\\'\\nand naturally enough considers it \\'a failure\\' (p. 410). \\'The old notion\\nof truth reappears,\\' he adds--that notion being, of course, that when a\\nbelief is true, its object does exist.\\n\\nIt is, of course, BOUND to exist, on sound pragmatic principles.\\nConcepts signify consequences. How is the world made different for me\\nby my conceiving an opinion of mine under the concept \\'true\\'? First, an\\nobject must be findable there (or sure signs of such an object must be\\nfound) which shall agree with the opinion. Second, such an opinion must\\nnot be contradicted by anything else I am aware of. But in spite of\\nthe obvious pragmatist requirement that when I have said truly that\\nsomething exists, it SHALL exist, the slander which Mr. Russell repeats\\nhas gained the widest currency.\\n\\nMr. Russell himself is far too witty and athletic a ratiocinator simply\\nto repeat the slander dogmatically. Being nothing if not mathematical\\nand logical, he must prove the accusation secundum artem, and convict us\\nnot so much of error as of absurdity. I have sincerely tried to follow\\nthe windings of his mind in this procedure, but for the life of me I\\ncan only see in it another example of what I have called (above, p. 249)\\nvicious abstractionism. The abstract world of mathematics and pure logic\\nis so native to Mr. Russell that he thinks that we describers of the\\nfunctions of concrete fact must also mean fixed mathematical terms\\nand functions. A mathematical term, as a, b, c, x, y, sin., log.,\\nis self-sufficient, and terms of this sort, once equated, can be\\nsubstituted for one another in endless series without error. Mr.\\nRussell, and also Mr. Hawtrey, of whom I shall speak presently, seem to\\nthink that in our mouth also such terms as \\'meaning,\\' \\'truth,\\' \\'belief,\\'\\n\\'object,\\' \\'definition,\\' are self-sufficients with no context of varying\\nrelation that might be further asked about. What a word means is\\nexpressed by its definition, isn\\'t it? The definition claims to be exact\\nand adequate, doesn\\'t it? Then it can be substituted for the word--since\\nthe two are identical--can\\'t it? Then two words with the same definition\\ncan be substituted for one another, n\\'est--ce pas? Likewise two\\ndefinitions of the same word, nicht wahr, etc., etc., till it will be\\nindeed strange if you can\\'t convict some one of self-contradiction and\\nabsurdity.\\n\\nThe particular application of this rigoristic treatment to my own little\\naccount of truth as working seems to be something like what follows.\\nI say \\'working\\' is what the \\'truth\\' of our ideas means, and call it a\\ndefinition. But since meanings and things meant, definitions and things\\ndefined, are equivalent and interchangeable, and nothing extraneous to\\nits definition can be meant when a term is used, it follows that who so\\ncalls an idea true, and means by that word that it works, cannot\\nmean anything else, can believe nothing but that it does work, and in\\nparticular can neither imply nor allow anything about its object or\\ndeliverance. \\'According to the pragmatists,\\' Mr. Russell writes, \\'to say\\n\"it is true that other people exist\" means \"it is useful to believe\\nthat other people exist.\" But if so, then these two phrases are merely\\ndifferent words for the same proposition; therefore when I believe the\\none, I believe the other\\' (p. 400). [Logic, I may say in passing, would\\nseem to require Mr. Russell to believe them both at once, but he ignores\\nthis consequence, and considers that other people exist\\' and \\'it is\\nuseful to believe that they do EVEN IF THEY DON\\'T,\\' must be identical\\nand therefore substitutable propositions in the pragmatist mouth.]\\n\\nBut may not real terms, I now ask, have accidents not expressed in their\\ndefinitions? and when a real value is finally substituted for the result\\nof an algebraic series of substituted definitions, do not all these\\naccidents creep back? Beliefs have their objective \\'content\\' or\\n\\'deliverance\\' as well as their truth, and truth has its implications\\nas well as its workings. If any one believe that other men exist, it is\\nboth a content of his belief and an implication of its truth, that they\\nshould exist in fact. Mr. Russell\\'s logic would seem to exclude,\\n\\'by definition,\\' all such accidents as contents, implications, and\\nassociates, and would represent us as translating all belief into a sort\\nof belief in pragmatism itself--of all things! If I say that a speech is\\neloquent, and explain \\'eloquent\\' as meaning the power to work in certain\\nways upon the audience; or if I say a book is original, and define\\n\\'original\\' to mean differing from other books, Russell\\'s logic, if I\\nfollow it at all, would seem to doom me to agreeing that the speech is\\nabout eloquence, and the book about other books. When I call a belief\\ntrue, and define its truth to mean its workings, I certainly do not mean\\nthat the belief is a belief ABOUT the workings. It is a belief about the\\nobject, and I who talk about the workings am a different subject, with\\na different universe of discourse, from that of the believer of whose\\nconcrete thinking I profess to give an account.\\n\\nThe social proposition \\'other men exist\\' and the pragmatist proposition\\n\\'it is expedient to believe that other men exist\\' come from different\\nuniverses of discourse. One can believe the second without being\\nlogically compelled to believe the first; one can believe the first\\nwithout having ever heard of the second; or one can believe them both.\\nThe first expresses the object of a belief, the second tells of one\\ncondition of the belief\\'s power to maintain itself. There is no identity\\nof any kind, save the term \\'other men\\' which they contain in common, in\\nthe two propositions; and to treat them as mutually substitutable, or\\nto insist that we shall do so, is to give up dealing with realities\\naltogether.\\n\\nMr. Ralph Hawtrey, who seems also to serve under the banner of\\nabstractionist logic, convicts us pragmatists of absurdity by arguments\\nsimilar to Mr. Russell\\'s. [Footnote: See The New Quarterly, for March,\\n1908.]\\n\\nAs a favor to us and for the sake of the argument, he abandons the\\nword \\'true\\' to our fury, allowing it to mean nothing but the fact that\\ncertain beliefs are expedient; and he uses the word \\'correctness\\' (as\\nMr. Pratt uses the word \\'trueness\\') to designate a fact, not about the\\nbelief, but about the belief\\'s object, namely that it is as the belief\\ndeclares it. \\'When therefore,\\' he writes, \\'I say it is correct to say\\nthat Caesar is dead, I mean \"Caesar is dead.\" This must be regarded as\\nthe definition of correctness.\\' And Mr. Hawtrey then goes on to demolish\\nme by the conflict of the definitions. What is \\'true\\' for the pragmatist\\ncannot be what is \\'correct,\\' he says, \\'for the definitions are not\\nlogically interchangeable; or if we interchange them, we reach the\\ntautology:\\n\\n\"Caesar is dead\" means \"it is expedient to believe that Caesar is dead.\"\\nBut what is it expedient to believe? Why, \"that Caesar is dead.\" A\\nprecious definition indeed of \\'Caesar is dead.\\'\\n\\nMr. Hawtrey\\'s conclusion would seem to be that the pragmatic definition\\nof the truth of a belief in no way implies--what?--that the believer\\nshall believe in his own belief\\'s deliverance?--or that the pragmatist\\nwho is talking about him shall believe in that deliverance? The two\\ncases are quite different. For the believer, Caesar must of course\\nreally exist; for the pragmatist critic he need not, for the pragmatic\\ndeliverance belongs, as I have just said, to another universe of\\ndiscourse altogether. When one argues by substituting definition for\\ndefinition, one needs to stay in the same universe.\\n\\nThe great shifting of universes in this discussion occurs when we carry\\nthe word \\'truth\\' from the subjective into the objective realm, applying\\nit sometimes to a property of opinions, sometimes to the facts which the\\nopinions assert. A number of writers, as Mr. Russell himself, Mr. G.\\nE. Moore, and others, favor the unlucky word \\'proposition,\\' which seems\\nexpressly invented to foster this confusion, for they speak of truth as\\na property of \\'propositions.\\' But in naming propositions it is almost\\nimpossible not to use the word \\'that.\\'\\n\\nTHAT Caesar is dead, THAT virtue is its own reward, are propositions.\\n\\nI do not say that for certain logical purposes it may not be useful to\\ntreat propositions as absolute entities, with truth or falsehood\\ninside of them respectively, or to make of a complex like\\n\\'that--Caesar--is--dead\\' a single term and call it a \\'truth.\\' But the\\n\\'that\\' here has the extremely convenient ambiguity for those who wish to\\nmake trouble for us pragmatists, that sometimes it means the FACT that,\\nand sometimes the BELIEF that, Caesar is no longer living. When I then\\ncall the belief true, I am told that the truth means the fact; when I\\nclaim the fact also, I am told that my definition has excluded the fact,\\nbeing a definition only of a certain peculiarity in the belief--so that\\nin the end I have no truth to talk about left in my possession.\\n\\nThe only remedy for this intolerable ambiguity is, it seems to me, to\\nstick to terms consistently. \\'Reality,\\' \\'idea\\' or \\'belief,\\' and the\\n\\'truth of the idea or belief,\\' which are the terms I have consistently\\nheld to, seem to be free from all objection.\\n\\nWhoever takes terms abstracted from all their natural settings,\\nidentifies them with definitions, and treats the latter more algebraico,\\nnot only risks mixing universes, but risks fallacies which the man in\\nthe street easily detects. To prove \\'by definition\\' that the statement\\n\\'Caesar exists\\' is identical with a statement about \\'expediency\\' because\\nthe one statement is \\'true\\' and the other is about \\'true statements,\\'\\nis like proving that an omnibus is a boat because both are vehicles. A\\nhorse may be defined as a beast that walks on the nails of his middle\\ndigits. Whenever we see a horse we see such a beast, just as whenever\\nwe believe a \\'truth\\' we believe something expedient. Messrs. Russell and\\nHawtrey, if they followed their antipragmatist logic, would have to say\\nhere that we see THAT IT IS such a beast, a fact which notoriously no\\none sees who is not a comparative anatomist.\\n\\nIt almost reconciles one to being no logician that one thereby escapes\\nso much abstractionism. Abstractionism of the worst sort dogs Mr.\\nRussell in his own trials to tell positively what the word \\'truth\\'\\nmeans. In the third of his articles on Meinong, in Mind, vol. xiii, p.\\n509 (1904), he attempts this feat by limiting the discussion to three\\nterms only, a proposition, its content, and an object, abstracting from\\nthe whole context of associated realities in which such terms are found\\nin every case of actual knowing. He puts the terms, thus taken in a\\nvacuum, and made into bare logical entities, through every possible\\npermutation and combination, tortures them on the rack until nothing is\\nleft of them, and after all this logical gymnastic, comes out with the\\nfollowing portentous conclusion as what he believes to be the correct\\nview: that there is no problem at all in truth and falsehood, that some\\npropositions are true and some false, just as some roses are red and\\nsome white, that belief is a certain attitude towards propositions,\\nwhich is called knowledge when they are true, error when they are\\nfalse\\'--and he seems to think that when once this insight is reached the\\nquestion may be considered closed forever!\\n\\nIn spite of my admiration of Mr. Russell\\'s analytic powers, I wish,\\nafter reading such an article, that pragmatism, even had it no other\\nfunction, might result in making him and other similarly gifted men\\nashamed of having used such powers in such abstraction from reality.\\nPragmatism saves us at any rate from such diseased abstractionism as\\nthose pages show.\\n\\nP. S. Since the foregoing rejoinder was written an article on Pragmatism\\nwhich I believe to be by Mr. Russell has appeared in the Edinburgh\\nReview for April, 1909. As far as his discussion of the truth-problem\\ngoes, altho he has evidently taken great pains to be fair, it seems\\nto me that he has in no essential respect improved upon his former\\narguments. I will therefore add nothing further, but simply refer\\nreaders who may be curious to pp. 272-280 of the said article.\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\nA DIALOGUE\\n\\nAfter correcting the proofs of all that precedes I imagine a residual\\nstate of mind on the part of my reader which may still keep him\\nunconvinced, and which it may be my duty to try at least to dispel. I\\ncan perhaps be briefer if I put what I have to say in dialogue form. Let\\nthen the anti-pragmatist begin:--\\n\\nAnti-Pragmatist:--You say that the truth of an idea is constituted by\\nits workings. Now suppose a certain state of facts, facts for example\\nof antediluvian planetary history, concerning which the question may be\\nasked:\\n\\n\\'Shall the truth about them ever be known?\\' And suppose (leaving the\\nhypothesis of an omniscient absolute out of the account) that we assume\\nthat the truth is never to be known. I ask you now, brother pragmatist,\\nwhether according to you there can be said to be any truth at all about\\nsuch a state of facts. Is there a truth, or is there not a truth, in\\ncases where at any rate it never comes to be known?\\n\\nPragmatist:--Why do you ask me such a question?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Because I think it puts you in a bad dilemma.\\n\\nPrag.:--How so?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Why, because if on the one hand you elect to say that\\nthere is a truth, you thereby surrender your whole pragmatist theory.\\nAccording to that theory, truth requires ideas and workings to\\nconstitute it; but in the present instance there is supposed to be no\\nknower, and consequently neither ideas nor workings can exist. What then\\nremains for you to make your truth of?\\n\\nPrag.:--Do you wish, like so many of my enemies, to force me to make the\\ntruth out of the reality itself? I cannot: the truth is something\\nknown, thought or said about the reality, and consequently numerically\\nadditional to it. But probably your intent is something different; so\\nbefore I say which horn of your dilemma I choose, I ask you to let me\\nhear what the other horn may be.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--The other horn is this, that if you elect to say that there\\nis no truth under the conditions assumed, because there are no ideas or\\nworkings, then you fly in the face of common sense. Doesn\\'t common sense\\nbelieve that every state of facts must in the nature of things be truly\\nstatable in some kind of a proposition, even tho in point of fact the\\nproposition should never be propounded by a living soul?\\n\\nPrag.:--Unquestionably common sense believes this, and so do I. There\\nhave been innumerable events in the history of our planet of which\\nnobody ever has been or ever will be able to give an account, yet of\\nwhich it can already be said abstractly that only one sort of possible\\naccount can ever be true. The truth about any such event is thus already\\ngenerically predetermined by the event\\'s nature; and one may accordingly\\nsay with a perfectly good conscience that it virtually pre-exists.\\nCommon sense is thus right in its instinctive contention.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Is this then the horn of the dilemma which you stand for?\\nDo you say that there is a truth even in cases where it shall never be\\nknown?\\n\\nPrag.:--Indeed I do, provided you let me hold consistently to my own\\nconception of truth, and do not ask me to abandon it for something which\\nI find impossible to comprehend.--You also believe, do you not, that\\nthere is a truth, even in cases where it never shall be known?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--I do indeed believe so.\\n\\nPrag.:--Pray then inform me in what, according to you, this truth\\nregarding the unknown consists.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Consists?--pray what do you mean by \\'consists\\'? It\\nconsists in nothing but itself, or more properly speaking it has neither\\nconsistence nor existence, it obtains, it holds.\\n\\nPrag.:--Well, what relation does it bear to the reality of which it\\nholds?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:-How do you mean, \\'what relation\\'? It holds of it, of course;\\nit knows it, it represents it.\\n\\nPrag.:--Who knows it? What represents it?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--The truth does; the truth knows it; or rather not exactly\\nthat, but any one knows it who possesses the truth. Any true idea of the\\nreality represents the truth concerning it.\\n\\nPrag.:--But I thought that we had agreed that no knower of it, nor any\\nidea representing it was to be supposed.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Sure enough!\\n\\nPrag.:--Then I beg you again to tell me in what this truth consists, all\\nby itself, this tertium quid intermediate between the facts per se, on\\nthe one hand, and all knowledge of them, actual or potential, on the\\nother. What is the shape of it in this third estate? Of what stuff,\\nmental, physical, or \\'epistemological,\\' is it built? What metaphysical\\nregion of reality does it inhabit?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--What absurd questions! Isn\\'t it enough to say that it is\\ntrue that the facts are so-and-so, and false that they are otherwise?\\n\\nPrag.:--\\'It\\' is true that the facts are so-and-so--I won\\'t yield to the\\ntemptation of asking you what is true; but I do ask you whether your\\nphrase that \\'it is true that\\' the facts are so-and-so really means\\nanything really additional to the bare being so-and-so of the facts\\nthemselves.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--It seems to mean more than the bare being of the facts. It\\nis a sort of mental equivalent for them, their epistemological function,\\ntheir value in noetic terms. Prag.:--A sort of spiritual double or ghost\\nof them, apparently! If so, may I ask you where this truth is found.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Where? where? There is no \\'where\\'--it simply obtains,\\nabsolutely obtains.\\n\\nPrag.:--Not in any one\\'s mind?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--No, for we agreed that no actual knower of the truth should\\nbe assumed.\\n\\nPrag.:--No actual knower, I agree. But are you sure that no notion of a\\npotential or ideal knower has anything to do with forming this strangely\\nelusive idea of the truth of the facts in your mind?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Of course if there be a truth concerning the facts, that\\ntruth is what the ideal knower would know. To that extent you can\\'t keep\\nthe notion of it and the notion of him separate. But it is not him first\\nand then it; it is it first and then him, in my opinion.\\n\\nPrag.:--But you still leave me terribly puzzled as to the status of this\\nso-called truth, hanging as it does between earth and heaven, between\\nreality and knowledge, grounded in the reality, yet numerically\\nadditional to it, and at the same time antecedent to any knower\\'s\\nopinion and entirely independent thereof. Is it as independent of the\\nknower as you suppose? It looks to me terribly dubious, as if it might\\nbe only another name for a potential as distinguished from an actual\\nknowledge of the reality. Isn\\'t your truth, after all, simply what\\nany successful knower would have to know in case he existed? And in a\\nuniverse where no knowers were even conceivable would any truth about\\nthe facts there as something numerically distinguishable from the facts\\nthemselves, find a place to exist in? To me such truth would not only be\\nnon-existent, it would be unimaginable, inconceivable.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--But I thought you said a while ago that there is a truth of\\npast events, even tho no one shall ever know it.\\n\\nPrag.:--Yes, but you must remember that I also stipulated for permission\\nto define the word in my own fashion. The truth of an event, past,\\npresent, or future, is for me only another name for the fact that if\\nthe event ever does get known, the nature of the knowledge is already to\\nsome degree predetermined. The truth which precedes actual knowledge of\\na fact means only what any possible knower of the fact will eventually\\nfind himself necessitated to believe about it. He must believe something\\nthat will bring him into satisfactory relations with it, that will prove\\na decent mental substitute for it. What this something may be is of\\ncourse partly fixed already by the nature of the fact and by the sphere\\nof its associations. This seems to me all that you can clearly mean when\\nyou say that truth pre-exists to knowledge. It is knowledge anticipated,\\nknowledge in the form of possibility merely.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--But what does the knowledge know when it comes? Doesn\\'t it\\nknow the truth? And, if so, mustn\\'t the truth be distinct from either\\nthe fact or the knowledge?\\n\\nPrag.:--It seems to me that what the knowledge knows is the fact itself,\\nthe event, or whatever the reality may be. Where you see three distinct\\nentities in the field, the reality, the knowing, and the truth, I see\\nonly two. Moreover, I can see what each of my two entities is known-as,\\nbut when I ask myself what your third entity, the truth, is known-as, I\\ncan find nothing distinct from the reality on the one hand, and the ways\\nin which it may be known on the other. Are you not probably misled by\\ncommon language, which has found it convenient to introduce a hybrid\\nname, meaning sometimes a kind of knowing and sometimes a reality known,\\nto apply to either of these things interchangeably? And has philosophy\\nanything to gain by perpetuating and consecrating the ambiguity? If you\\ncall the object of knowledge \\'reality,\\' and call the manner of its\\nbeing cognized \\'truth,\\' cognized moreover on particular occasions, and\\nvariously, by particular human beings who have their various businesses\\nwith it, and if you hold consistently to this nomenclature, it seems to\\nme that you escape all sorts of trouble.\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Do you mean that you think you escape from my dilemma?\\n\\nPrag.:--Assuredly I escape; for if truth and knowledge are terms\\ncorrelative and interdependent, as I maintain they are, then wherever\\nknowledge is conceivable truth is conceivable, wherever knowledge\\nis possible truth is possible, wherever knowledge is actual truth is\\nactual. Therefore when you point your first horn at me, I think of truth\\nactual, and say it doesn\\'t exist. It doesn\\'t; for by hypothesis there is\\nno knower, no ideas, no workings. I agree, however, that truth possible\\nor virtual might exist, for a knower might possibly be brought to birth;\\nand truth conceivable certainly exists, for, abstractly taken, there\\nis nothing in the nature of antediluvian events that should make the\\napplication of knowledge to them inconceivable. Therefore when you try\\nto impale me on your second horn, I think of the truth in question as a\\nmere abstract possibility, so I say it does exist, and side with common\\nsense.\\n\\nDo not these distinctions rightly relieve me from embarrassment? And\\ndon\\'t you think it might help you to make them yourself?\\n\\nAnti-Prag.:--Never!--so avaunt with your abominable hair-splitting and\\nsophistry! Truth is truth; and never will I degrade it by identifying it\\nwith low pragmatic particulars in the way you propose.\\n\\nPrag.:--Well, my dear antagonist, I hardly hoped to convert an eminent\\nintellectualist and logician like you; so enjoy, as long as you live,\\nyour own ineffable conception. Perhaps the rising generation will\\ngrow up more accustomed than you are to that concrete and empirical\\ninterpretation of terms in which the pragmatic method consists. Perhaps\\nthey may then wonder how so harmless and natural an account of truth as\\nmine could have found such difficulty in entering the minds of men far\\nmore intelligent than I can ever hope to become, but wedded by education\\nand tradition to the abstractionist manner of thought.\\n',\n",
              " 'Title: A Discourse on Method\\n\\nAuthor: René Descartes\\n\\n\\n\\n        DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD OF RIGHTLY CONDUCTING THE REASON,\\n                   AND SEEKING TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES\\n\\n                           by Rene Descartes\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR\\n\\nIf this Discourse appear too long to be read at once, it may be divided\\ninto six Parts:  and, in the first, will be found various\\nconsiderations touching the Sciences; in the second, the principal\\nrules of the Method which the Author has discovered, in the third,\\ncertain of the rules of Morals which he has deduced from this Method;\\nin the fourth, the reasonings by which he establishes the existence of\\nGod and of the Human Soul, which are the foundations of his Metaphysic;\\nin the fifth, the order of the Physical questions which he has\\ninvestigated, and, in particular, the explication of the motion of the\\nheart and of some other difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also\\nthe difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes; and, in\\nthe last, what the Author believes to be required in order to greater\\nadvancement in the investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with\\nthe reasons that have induced him to write.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nGood sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed;\\nfor every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those\\neven who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not\\nusually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already\\npossess.  And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken the\\nconviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging\\naright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what\\nis called  good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and\\nthat the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from\\nsome being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but\\nsolely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways,\\nand do not fix our attention on the same objects.  For to be possessed\\nof a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to\\napply it.  The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest\\nexcellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those\\nwho travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they\\nkeep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run,\\nforsake it.\\n\\nFor myself, I have never fancied my mind to be in any respect more\\nperfect than those of the generality; on the contrary, I have often\\nwished that I were equal to some others in promptitude of thought, or\\nin clearness and distinctness of imagination, or in fullness and\\nreadiness of memory.  And besides these, I know of no other qualities\\nthat contribute to the perfection of the mind; for as to the reason or\\nsense, inasmuch as it is that alone which constitutes us men, and\\ndistinguishes us from the brutes, I am disposed to believe that it is\\nto be found complete in each individual; and on this point to adopt the\\ncommon opinion of philosophers, who say that the difference of greater\\nand less holds only among the accidents, and not among the forms or\\nnatures of individuals of the same species.\\n\\nI will not hesitate, however, to avow my belief that it has been my\\nsingular good  fortune to have very early in life fallen in with\\ncertain tracks which have conducted me to considerations and maxims, of\\nwhich I have formed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of\\ngradually augmenting my knowledge, and of raising it by little and\\nlittle to the highest point which the mediocrity of my talents and the\\nbrief duration of my life will permit me to reach.  For I have already\\nreaped from it such fruits that, although I have been accustomed to\\nthink lowly enough of myself, and although when I look with the eye of\\na philosopher at the varied courses and pursuits of mankind at large, I\\nfind scarcely one which does not appear in vain and useless, I\\nnevertheless derive the highest satisfaction from the progress I\\nconceive myself to have already made in the search after truth, and\\ncannot help entertaining such expectations of the future as to believe\\nthat if, among the occupations of men as men, there is any one really\\nexcellent and important, it is that which I have chosen.\\n\\nAfter all, it is possible I may be mistaken; and it is but a little\\ncopper and glass, perhaps, that I take for gold and diamonds.  I know\\nhow very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and\\nalso how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when\\ngiven in our favor.  But I shall endeavor in this discourse to describe\\nthe paths I have followed, and to delineate my life as in a picture, in\\norder that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself, and\\nthat in the general opinion entertained of them, as gathered from\\ncurrent report, I myself may have a new help towards instruction to be\\nadded to those I have been in the habit of employing.\\n\\nMy present design, then, is not to teach the method which each ought to\\nfollow for the right conduct of his reason, but solely to describe the\\nway in which I have endeavored to conduct my own.  They who set\\nthemselves to give precepts must of course regard themselves as\\npossessed of greater skill than those to whom they prescribe; and if\\nthey err in the slightest particular, they subject themselves to\\ncensure.  But as this tract is put forth merely as a history, or, if\\nyou will, as a tale, in which, amid some examples worthy of imitation,\\nthere will be found, perhaps, as many more which it were advisable not\\nto follow, I hope it will prove useful to some without being hurtful to\\nany, and that my openness will find some favor with all.\\n\\nFrom my childhood, I have been familiar with letters; and as I was\\ngiven to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of\\nall that is useful in life might be acquired, I was ardently desirous\\nof instruction.  But as soon as I had finished the entire course of\\nstudy, at the close of which it is customary to be admitted into the\\norder of the learned, I completely changed my opinion.  For I found\\nmyself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I\\nhad advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the\\ndiscovery at every turn of my own ignorance.  And yet I was studying in\\none of the most celebrated schools in Europe, in which I thought there\\nmust be learned men,  if such were anywhere to be found.  I had been\\ntaught all that others learned there; and not contented with the\\nsciences actually taught us, I had, in addition, read all the books\\nthat had fallen into my hands, treating of such branches as are\\nesteemed the most curious and rare.  I knew the judgment which others\\nhad formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to\\nmy fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked\\nout to fill the places of our instructors.  And, in fine, our age\\nappeared to me as flourishing, and as fertile in powerful minds as any\\npreceding one.  I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all\\nother men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in\\nexistence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to\\nbelieve.\\n\\nI still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the\\nschools.  I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary\\nto the understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of\\nfable stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it;\\nand, if read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the\\nperusal of all excellent books is,  as it were, to interview with the\\nnoblest men of past ages, who have written them, and even a studied\\ninterview, in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts;\\nthat eloquence has incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its\\nravishing graces and delights; that in the mathematics there are many\\nrefined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as\\nwell as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous\\nhighly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in\\ntreatises on morals; that theology points out the path to heaven; that\\nphilosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth\\non all matters, and commands the admiration of the more simple; that\\njurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences, secure for their\\ncultivators honors and riches; and, in fine, that it is useful to\\nbestow some attention upon all, even upon those abounding the most in\\nsuperstition and error, that we may be in a position to determine their\\nreal value, and guard against being deceived.\\n\\nBut I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages,\\nand likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their\\nhistories and fables.   For to hold converse with those of other ages\\nand to travel, are almost the same thing.  It is useful to know\\nsomething of the manners of different nations, that we may be enabled\\nto form a more correct judgment regarding our own, and be prevented\\nfrom thinking that everything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and\\nirrational, a conclusion usually come to by those whose experience has\\nbeen limited to their own country.  On the other hand, when too much\\ntime is occupied in traveling, we become strangers to our native\\ncountry; and the over curious in the customs of the past are generally\\nignorant of those of the present.  Besides, fictitious narratives lead\\nus to imagine the possibility of many events that are impossible; and\\neven the most faithful histories, if they do not wholly misrepresent\\nmatters, or exaggerate their importance to render the account of them\\nmore worthy of perusal, omit, at least, almost always the meanest and\\nleast striking of the attendant circumstances; hence it happens that\\nthe remainder does not represent the truth, and that such as regulate\\ntheir conduct by examples drawn from this source, are apt to fall into\\nthe extravagances of the knight-errants of romance, and to entertain\\nprojects that exceed their powers.\\n\\nI esteemed eloquence highly, and was in raptures with poesy; but I\\nthought that both were gifts of nature rather than fruits of study.\\nThose in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most\\nskillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and\\nintelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth\\nof what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of\\nLower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and\\nthose whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who\\ncan give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and\\nharmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of\\npoetry.\\n\\nI was especially delighted with the mathematics, on account of the\\ncertitude and evidence of their reasonings;  but I had not as yet a\\nprecise knowledge of their true use; and thinking that they but\\ncontributed to the advancement of the mechanical arts, I was astonished\\nthat foundations, so strong and solid, should have had no loftier\\nsuperstructure reared on them.  On the other hand, I compared the\\ndisquisitions of the ancient moralists to very towering and magnificent\\npalaces with no better foundation than sand and mud:  they laud the\\nvirtues very highly, and exhibit them as estimable far above anything\\non earth; but they give us no adequate criterion of virtue, and\\nfrequently that which they designate with so fine a name is but apathy,\\nor pride, or despair, or parricide.\\n\\nI revered our theology, and aspired as much as any one to reach heaven:\\nbut being given assuredly to understand that the way is not less open\\nto the most ignorant than to the most learned, and that the revealed\\ntruths which lead to heaven are above our comprehension, I did not\\npresume to subject them to the impotency of my reason; and I thought\\nthat in order competently to undertake their examination, there was\\nneed of some special help from heaven, and of being more than man.\\n\\nOf philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had\\nbeen cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men, and that\\nyet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still\\nin dispute, and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not\\npresume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that\\nof others; and further, when I considered the number of conflicting\\nopinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men,\\nwhile there can be but one true, I reckoned as well-nigh false all that\\nwas only probable.\\n\\nAs to the other sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles\\nfrom philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared\\non foundations so infirm; and neither the honor nor the gain held out\\nby them was sufficient to determine me to their cultivation:  for I was\\nnot, thank Heaven, in a condition which compelled me to make\\nmerchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune; and though I\\nmight not profess to scorn glory as a cynic, I yet made very slight\\naccount of that honor which I hoped to acquire only through fictitious\\ntitles.  And, in fine, of false sciences I thought I knew the worth\\nsufficiently to escape being deceived by the professions of an\\nalchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a\\nmagician, or by the artifices and boasting of any of those who profess\\nto know things of which they are ignorant.\\n\\nFor these reasons, as soon as my age permitted me to pass from under\\nthe control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of\\nletters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the\\nknowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world.  I spent the\\nremainder of my youth in traveling, in visiting courts and armies, in\\nholding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in\\ncollecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different\\nsituations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such\\nreflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement.\\nFor it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the\\nreasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he\\nis personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish\\nhim if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters\\nin his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical\\nmoment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps,\\nthan that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are\\nfrom common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise\\nof greater ingenuity and art to render them probable.  In addition, I\\nhad always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true\\nfrom the false, in order that I might be able clearly to discriminate\\nthe right path in life, and proceed in it with confidence.\\n\\nIt is true that, while busied only in considering the manners of other\\nmen, I found here, too, scarce any ground for settled conviction, and\\nremarked hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinions of\\nthe philosophers.  So that the greatest advantage I derived from the\\nstudy consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however\\nextravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common\\nconsent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to\\nentertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of\\nwhich I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I\\ngradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken\\nour natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from\\nlistening to reason.  But after I had been occupied several years in\\nthus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some\\nexperience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and\\nto employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to\\nfollow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than\\nit would have been had I never quitted my country or my books.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II\\n\\nI was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country,\\nwhich have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was\\nreturning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the setting\\nin of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to\\ninterest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or\\npassions, I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity\\nto occupy my attention with my own thoughts.  Of these one of the very\\nfirst that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much perfection\\nin works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands\\nhad been employed, as in those completed by a single master.   Thus it\\nis observable that the buildings which a single architect has planned\\nand executed, are generally more elegant and commodious than those\\nwhich several have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for\\npurposes for which they were not originally built.  Thus also, those\\nancient cities which, from being at first only villages, have become,\\nin course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid out compared\\nwith the regularity constructed towns which a professional architect\\nhas freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several\\nbuildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of\\nthe latter, yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition,\\nthere a large one and here a small, and the consequent crookedness and\\nirregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance\\nrather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an\\narrangement.  And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at\\nall times certain officers whose duty it was to see that private\\nbuildings contributed to public ornament, the difficulty of reaching\\nhigh perfection with but the materials of others to operate on, will be\\nreadily acknowledged.  In the same way I fancied that those nations\\nwhich, starting from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to\\ncivilization by slow degrees, have had their laws successively\\ndetermined, and, as it were, forced upon them simply by experience of\\nthe hurtfulness of particular crimes and disputes, would by this\\nprocess come to be possessed of less perfect institutions than those\\nwhich, from the commencement of their association as communities, have\\nfollowed the appointments of some wise legislator.  It is thus quite\\ncertain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of\\nwhich are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of\\nevery other.  And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the\\npre-eminence of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws\\nin particular, for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to\\ngood morals, but to the circumstance that, originated by a single\\nindividual, they all tended to a single end.  In the same way I thought\\nthat the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made\\nup of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they\\nare of the opinions of many different individuals massed together, are\\nfarther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of\\ngood sense using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting\\nthe matters of his experience.  And because we have all to pass through\\na state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length\\nof time, governed by our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were\\nfrequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled us for\\nthe best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our\\njudgments can be so correct or solid as they would have been, had our\\nreason been mature from the moment of our birth, and had we always been\\nguided by it alone.\\n\\nIt is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the\\nhouses of a town with the single design of rebuilding them differently,\\nand thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often happens\\nthat a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting\\nit anew, and that people are even sometimes constrained to this when\\ntheir houses are in danger of falling from age, or when the foundations\\nare insecure.  With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded\\nthat it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think\\nof reforming a state by fundamentally changing it throughout, and\\noverturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought\\nwas true of any similar project for reforming the body of the sciences,\\nor the order of teaching them established in the schools:  but as for\\nthe opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I\\ncould not do better than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away,\\nthat I might afterwards be in a position to admit either others more\\ncorrect, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny\\nof reason.  I firmly believed that in this way I should much better\\nsucceed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old\\nfoundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken\\nupon trust.  For although I recognized various difficulties in this\\nundertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once to be\\ncompared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public\\naffairs.  Large bodies, if once overthrown, are with great difficulty\\nset up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken, and the\\nfall of such is always disastrous.  Then if there are any imperfections\\nin the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the diversity\\nof constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us), custom has without\\ndoubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to\\nsteer altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which\\nsagacity could not have provided against with equal effect; and, in\\nfine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change\\nnecessary for their removal; in the same manner that highways which\\nwind among mountains, by being much frequented, become gradually so\\nsmooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to\\nseek a straighter path by climbing over the tops of rocks and\\ndescending to the bottoms of precipices.\\n\\nHence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and\\nbusy meddlers who, called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in\\nthe management of public affairs, are yet always projecting reforms;\\nand if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify\\nthe suspicion that I was a victim of such folly, I would by no means\\npermit its publication.  I have never contemplated anything higher than\\nthe reformation of my own opinions, and basing them on a foundation\\nwholly my own.  And although my own satisfaction with my work has led\\nme to present here a draft of it, I do not by any means therefore\\nrecommend to every one else to make a similar attempt.  Those whom God\\nhas endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps,\\ndesigns still more exalted; but for the many I am much afraid lest even\\nthe present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to\\nimitate.  The single design to strip one\\'s self of all past beliefs is\\none that ought not to be taken by every one.  The majority of men is\\ncomposed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a\\nbefitting resolution:  in the first place, of those who with more than\\na due confidence in their own powers, are precipitate in their\\njudgments and want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect\\nthinking; whence it happens, that if men of this class once take the\\nliberty to doubt of their accustomed opinions, and quit the beaten\\nhighway, they will never be able to thread the byway that would lead\\nthem by a shorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to\\nwander for life; in the second place, of those who, possessed of\\nsufficient sense or modesty to determine that there are others who\\nexcel them in the power of discriminating between truth and error, and\\nby whom they may be instructed, ought rather to content themselves with\\nthe opinions of such than trust for more correct to their own reason.\\n\\nFor my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class,\\nhad I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known\\nthe diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed\\namong men of the greatest learning.  But I had become aware, even so\\nearly as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and\\nincredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on\\nof the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I\\nremarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours\\nare not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary\\nthat many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of\\ntheir reason than we do.  I took into account also the very different\\ncharacter which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany\\nexhibits, from that which, with the same mind originally, this\\nindividual would have possessed had he lived always among the Chinese\\nor with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion\\nwhich pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be\\nreceived into favor before ten years have gone, appears to us at this\\nmoment extravagant and ridiculous.  I was thus led to infer that the\\nground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain\\nknowledge.  And, finally, although such be the ground of our opinions,\\nI remarked that a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth where\\nit is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more\\nlikely that it will be found by one than by many.  I could, however,\\nselect from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of\\npreference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my\\nown reason in the conduct of my life.\\n\\nBut like one walking alone and in the dark, I resolved to proceed so\\nslowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I\\nwould at least guard against falling.  I did not even choose to dismiss\\nsummarily any of the opinions that had crept into my belief without\\nhaving been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient time\\ncarefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was\\nsetting myself, and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the\\nknowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.\\n\\nAmong the branches of philosophy, I had, at an earlier period, given\\nsome attention to logic, and among those of the mathematics to\\ngeometrical analysis and algebra,--three arts or sciences which ought,\\nas I conceived, to contribute something to my design.  But, on\\nexamination, I found that, as for logic, its syllogisms and the\\nmajority of its other precepts are of avail--rather in the\\ncommunication of what we already know, or even as the art of Lully, in\\nspeaking without judgment of things of which we are ignorant, than in\\nthe investigation of the unknown; and although this science contains\\nindeed a number of correct and very excellent precepts, there are,\\nnevertheless, so many others, and these either injurious or\\nsuperfluous, mingled with the former, that it is almost quite as\\ndifficult to effect a severance of the true from the false as it is to\\nextract a Diana or a Minerva from a rough block of marble.  Then as to\\nthe analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns, besides\\nthat they embrace only matters highly abstract, and, to appearance, of\\nno use, the former is so exclusively restricted to the consideration of\\nfigures, that it can exercise the understanding only on condition of\\ngreatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the latter, there is so\\ncomplete a subjection to certain rules and formulas, that there results\\nan art full of confusion and obscurity calculated to embarrass, instead\\nof a science fitted to cultivate the mind.  By these considerations I\\nwas induced to seek some other method which would comprise the\\nadvantages of the three and be exempt from their defects.  And as a\\nmultitude of laws often only hampers justice, so that a state is best\\ngoverned when, with few laws, these are rigidly administered; in like\\nmanner, instead of the great number of precepts of which logic is\\ncomposed, I believed that the four following would prove perfectly\\nsufficient for me, provided I took the firm and unwavering resolution\\nnever in a single instance to fail in observing them.\\n\\nThe first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly\\nknow to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and\\nprejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was\\npresented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground\\nof doubt.\\n\\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into\\nas many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate\\nsolution.\\n\\nThe third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing\\nwith objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little\\nand little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more\\ncomplex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects\\nwhich in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and\\nsequence.\\n\\nAnd the last, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and\\nreviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.\\n\\nThe long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which\\ngeometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most\\ndifficult demonstrations, had led me to imagine that all things, to the\\nknowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same\\nway, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond\\nour reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we\\nabstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in\\nour thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from\\nanother.  And I had little difficulty in determining the objects with\\nwhich it was necessary to commence, for I was already persuaded that it\\nmust be with the simplest and easiest to know, and, considering that of\\nall those who have hitherto sought truth in the sciences, the\\nmathematicians alone have been able to find any demonstrations, that\\nis, any certain and evident reasons, I did not doubt but that such must\\nhave been the rule of their investigations.  I resolved to commence,\\ntherefore, with the examination of the simplest objects, not\\nanticipating, however, from this any other advantage than that to be\\nfound in accustoming my mind to the love and nourishment of truth, and\\nto a distaste for all such reasonings as were unsound.  But I had no\\nintention on that account of attempting to master all the particular\\nsciences commonly denominated mathematics:  but observing that, however\\ndifferent their objects, they all agree in considering only the various\\nrelations or proportions subsisting among those objects, I thought it\\nbest for my purpose to consider these proportions in the most general\\nform possible, without referring them to any objects in particular,\\nexcept such as would most facilitate the knowledge of them, and without\\nby any means restricting them to these, that afterwards I might thus be\\nthe better able to apply them to every other class of objects to which\\nthey are legitimately applicable.  Perceiving further, that in order to\\nunderstand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one\\nby one and sometimes only to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the\\naggregate, I thought that, in order the better to consider them\\nindividually, I should view them as subsisting between straight lines,\\nthan which I could find no objects more simple, or capable of being\\nmore distinctly represented to my imagination and senses; and on the\\nother hand, that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an\\naggregate of many, I should express them by certain characters the\\nbriefest possible.  In this way I believed that I could borrow all that\\nwas best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra, and correct all\\nthe defects of the one by help of the other.\\n\\nAnd, in point of fact, the accurate observance of these few precepts\\ngave me, I take the liberty of saying, such ease in unraveling all the\\nquestions embraced in these two sciences, that in the two or three\\nmonths I devoted to their examination, not only did I reach solutions\\nof questions I had formerly deemed exceedingly difficult but even as\\nregards questions of the solution of which I continued ignorant, I was\\nenabled, as it appeared to me, to determine the means whereby, and the\\nextent to which a solution was possible; results attributable to the\\ncircumstance that I commenced with the simplest and most general\\ntruths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the\\ndiscovery of subsequent ones Nor in this perhaps shall I appear too\\nvain, if it be considered that, as the truth on any particular point is\\none whoever apprehends the truth, knows all that on that  point can be\\nknown.  The child, for example, who has been instructed in the elements\\nof arithmetic, and has made a particular addition, according to rule,\\nmay be assured that he has found, with respect to the sum of the\\nnumbers before him, and that in this instance is within the reach of\\nhuman genius.  Now, in conclusion, the method which teaches adherence\\nto the true order, and an exact enumeration of all the conditions of\\nthe thing sought includes all that gives certitude to the rules of\\narithmetic.\\n\\nBut the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method, was the\\nassurance I had of thereby exercising my reason in all matters, if not\\nwith absolute perfection, at least with the greatest attainable by me:\\nbesides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gradually\\nhabituated to clearer and more distinct conceptions of its objects; and\\nI hoped also, from not having restricted this method to any particular\\nmatter, to apply it to the difficulties of the other sciences, with not\\nless success than to those of algebra.  I should not, however, on this\\naccount have ventured at once on the examination of all the\\ndifficulties of the sciences which presented themselves to me, for this\\nwould have been contrary to the order prescribed in the method, but\\nobserving that the knowledge of such is dependent on principles\\nborrowed from philosophy, in which I found nothing certain, I thought\\nit necessary first of all to endeavor to establish its principles.  And\\nbecause I observed, besides, that an inquiry of this kind was of all\\nothers of the greatest moment, and one in which precipitancy and\\nanticipation in judgment were most to be dreaded, I thought that I\\nought not to approach it till I had reached a more mature age (being at\\nthat time but twenty-three), and had first of all employed much of my\\ntime in preparation for the work, as well by eradicating from my mind\\nall the erroneous opinions I had up to that moment accepted, as by\\namassing variety of experience to afford materials for my reasonings,\\nand by continually exercising myself in my chosen method with a view to\\nincreased skill in its application.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART III\\n\\nAnd finally, as it is not enough, before commencing to rebuild the\\nhouse in which we live, that it be pulled down, and materials and\\nbuilders provided, or that we engage in the work ourselves, according\\nto a plan which we have beforehand carefully drawn out, but as it is\\nlikewise necessary that we be furnished with some other house in which\\nwe may live commodiously during the operations, so that I might not\\nremain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to\\nsuspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living\\nthenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory\\ncode of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am\\ndesirous to make you acquainted.\\n\\nThe first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering\\nfirmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated\\nfrom my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter\\naccording to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from\\nextremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general\\nconsent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living.\\nFor as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought\\nbecause I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced\\nthat I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of\\nthe most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the\\nPersians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed\\nto dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the\\nopinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to\\nme that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought\\nrather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they\\nsaid, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few\\ndisposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many\\nare not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act\\nof mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we\\nknow that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other.\\nAlso, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most\\nmoderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most\\nconvenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is\\ngenerally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I\\nmight be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of\\nthe extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have\\nadopted.  And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises\\nby which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of\\nthe laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble\\nresolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit\\nengagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in\\nit, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements\\nwhere the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent:  but because I\\ndid not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and\\nbecause, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my\\njudgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed\\nit a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved\\nof something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it\\nfor good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or\\nI had ceased to esteem it such.\\n\\nMy second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was\\nable, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions,\\nwhen once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in\\nthis the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a\\nforest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one\\nplace, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a\\nline as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons,\\nalthough perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the\\nselection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they\\ndesire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will\\nprobably be preferable to the middle of a forest.  In the same way,\\nsince in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it\\nis very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is\\ntrue, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even\\nalthough we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than\\nin another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and\\nafterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no\\nlonger dubious, but manifestly true and certain,  since the reason by\\nwhich our choice has been determined  is itself possessed of these\\nqualities.  This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of\\nall those repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the\\nconsciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any\\nclear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to\\nadopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as\\nthe opposite.\\n\\nMy third maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than\\nfortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and\\nin general, accustom  myself to the persuasion that, except our own\\nthoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we\\nhave done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of\\nsuccess is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible:  and this\\nsingle principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring\\nfor the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me\\ncontented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which\\nthe understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it\\nis plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our\\npower, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to\\nour birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours,  than our\\nnot possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to\\nspeak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in\\ndisease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies\\nincorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with.  But I\\nconfess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated\\nmeditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and\\nI believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of\\nsuch philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to\\nthe influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a\\nhappiness which their gods might have envied.  For, occupied\\nincessantly with the consideration of the limits prescribed to their\\npower by nature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at\\ntheir disposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of\\nitself sufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other\\nobjects; and over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that\\nthey had some ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich\\nand more powerful, more free and more happy, than other men who,\\nwhatever be the favors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if\\ndestitute of this philosophy, can never command the realization of all\\ntheir desires.\\n\\nIn fine, to conclude this code of morals, I thought of reviewing the\\ndifferent occupations of men in this life, with the view of making\\nchoice of the best.  And, without wishing to offer any remarks on the\\nemployments of others, I may state that it was my conviction that I\\ncould not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged, viz.,\\nin devoting my whole life to the culture of my reason, and in making\\nthe greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth, on the\\nprinciples of the method which I had prescribed to myself.  This\\nmethod, from the time I had begun to apply it, had been to me the\\nsource of satisfaction so intense as to lead me to, believe that more\\nperfect or more innocent could not be enjoyed in this life; and as by\\nits means I daily discovered truths that appeared to me of some\\nimportance, and of which other men were generally ignorant, the\\ngratification thence arising so occupied my mind that I was wholly\\nindifferent to every other object.  Besides, the three preceding maxims\\nwere founded singly on the design of continuing the work of\\nself-instruction.  For since God has endowed each of us with some light\\nof reason by which to distinguish truth from error, I could not have\\nbelieved that I ought for a single moment to rest satisfied with the\\nopinions of another, unless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment\\nin examining these whenever I should be duly qualified for the task.\\nNor could I have proceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I\\nsupposed that I should thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining\\nstill more accurate, should such exist.  And, in fine, I could not have\\nrestrained my desires, nor remained satisfied had I not followed a path\\nin which I thought myself certain of attaining all the knowledge to the\\nacquisition of which I was competent, as well as the largest amount of\\nwhat is truly good which I could ever hope to secure Inasmuch as we\\nneither seek nor shun any object except in so far as our understanding\\nrepresents it as good or bad, all that is necessary to right action is\\nright judgment, and to the best action the most correct judgment, that\\nis, to the acquisition of all the virtues with all else that is truly\\nvaluable and within our reach; and the assurance of such an acquisition\\ncannot fail to render us contented.\\n\\nHaving thus provided myself with these maxims, and having placed them\\nin reserve along with the truths of  faith, which have ever occupied\\nthe first place in my  belief, I came to the conclusion that I might\\nwith freedom set about ridding myself of what remained of my opinions.\\nAnd, inasmuch as I hoped to be better able successfully to accomplish\\nthis work by holding intercourse with mankind, than by remaining longer\\nshut up in the retirement where these thoughts had occurred to me, I\\nbetook me again to traveling before the winter was well ended.  And,\\nduring the nine subsequent years, I did nothing but roam from one place\\nto another, desirous of being a  spectator rather than an actor in the\\nplays exhibited on the theater of the world; and, as I made it my\\nbusiness in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly\\nbe doubted and prove a source of error, I gradually rooted out from my\\nmind all the errors which had hitherto crept into it.  Not that in this\\nI imitated the sceptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek\\nnothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design  was\\nsingly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the  loose earth and\\nsand, that I might reach the rock or the clay.  In this, as appears to\\nme, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the\\nfalsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble\\nconjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so\\ndoubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty,\\nalthough this were merely the inference, that the matter in question\\ncontained nothing certain.  And, just as in pulling down an old house,\\nwe usually reserve the ruins to contribute towards the erection, so, in\\ndestroying such of my opinions as I judged to be Ill-founded, I made a\\nvariety of observations and acquired an amount of experience of which I\\navailed myself in the establishment of more certain.  And further, I\\ncontinued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed; for,\\nbesides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to\\nits rules, I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly\\ndevoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical\\ndifficulties, or even in the solution likewise of some questions\\nbelonging to other sciences, but which, by my having detached them from\\nsuch principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty, were\\nrendered almost mathematical:  the truth of this will be manifest from\\nthe numerous examples contained in this volume.  And thus, without in\\nappearance living otherwise than those who, with no other occupation\\nthan that of spending their lives agreeably and innocently, study to\\nsever pleasure from vice, and who, that they may enjoy their leisure\\nwithout ennui, have recourse to such pursuits as are honorable, I was\\nnevertheless prosecuting my design, and making greater progress in the\\nknowledge of truth, than I might, perhaps, have made had I been engaged\\nin the perusal of books merely, or in holding converse with men of\\nletters.\\n\\nThese nine years passed away, however, before I had come to any\\ndeterminate judgment respecting the difficulties which form matter of\\ndispute among the learned, or had commenced to seek the principles of\\nany philosophy more certain than the vulgar.  And the examples of many\\nmen of the highest genius, who had, in former times, engaged in this\\ninquiry, but, as appeared to me, without success, led me to imagine it\\nto be a work of so much difficulty, that I would not perhaps have\\nventured on it so soon had I not heard it currently  rumored that I had\\nalready completed the inquiry.  I know not what were the grounds of\\nthis opinion; and, if my conversation contributed in any measure to its\\nrise, this must have happened rather from my having confessed my\\nIgnorance with greater freedom than those are accustomed to do who have\\nstudied a little, and expounded perhaps, the reasons that led me to\\ndoubt of many of those things that by others are esteemed certain, than\\nfrom my having boasted of any system of philosophy.  But, as I am of a\\ndisposition that makes me unwilling to be esteemed different from what\\nI really am, I thought it necessary to endeavor by all means to render\\nmyself worthy of the reputation accorded to me; and it is now exactly\\neight years since this desire constrained me to remove from all those\\nplaces where interruption from any of my acquaintances was possible,\\nand betake myself to this country, in which the long duration of the\\nwar has led to the establishment of such discipline, that the armies\\nmaintained seem to be of use only in enabling the inhabitants to enjoy\\nmore securely the blessings of peace and where, in the midst of a great\\ncrowd actively engaged in business, and more careful of their own\\naffairs than curious about those of others, I have been enabled to live\\nwithout being deprived of any of the conveniences to be had in the most\\npopulous cities, and yet as solitary and as retired as in the midst of\\nthe most remote deserts.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART IV\\n\\nI am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the\\nplace above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so\\nmetaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to\\nevery one.  And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations\\nthat I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure\\nconstrained to advert to them.  I had long before remarked that, in\\nrelation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above\\ndoubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been\\nalready said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the\\nsearch after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was\\ncalled for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions\\nin regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order\\nto ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that\\nwas wholly indubitable.  Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes\\ndeceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really\\nsuch as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning,\\nand fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I,\\nconvinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false\\nall the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and\\nfinally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations)\\nwhich we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are\\nasleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed\\nthat all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind\\nwhen awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams.\\nBut immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to\\nthink that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus\\nthought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I\\nthink, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such\\nevidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged\\nby the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might,\\nwithout scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of\\nwhich I was in search.\\n\\nIn the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed\\nthat I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world\\nnor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore\\nsuppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very\\ncircumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it\\nmost clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other\\nhand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects\\nwhich I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have\\nhad no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was\\na substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking,\\nand which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on\\nany material thing; so that \"I,\" that is to say, the mind by which I am\\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is  even more easily\\nknown than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not,\\nit would still continue to be all that it is.\\n\\nAfter this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth\\nand certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I\\nknew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the\\nground of this certitude.  And as I observed that in the words I think,\\ntherefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of\\ntheir truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think\\nit is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general\\nrule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and\\ndistinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is\\nsome difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly\\nconceive.\\n\\nIn the next place, from reflecting on the circumstance that I doubted,\\nand that consequently my being was not wholly perfect (for I clearly\\nsaw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led\\nto inquire whence I had learned to think of something more perfect than\\nmyself; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some\\nnature which in reality was more perfect.  As for the thoughts of many\\nother objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat,\\nand a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came;\\nfor since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them\\nsuperior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were\\ndependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain\\nperfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing,\\nthat is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection\\nof my nature.  But this could not be the case with-the idea of a nature\\nmore perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing\\nmanifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the\\nmore perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less\\nperfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was\\nequally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it\\nbut remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in\\nreality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself\\nall the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in\\na single word, which was God.  And to this I added that, since I knew\\nsome perfections which I did not possess, I was not the only being in\\nexistence (I will here, with your permission, freely use the terms of\\nthe schools); but, on the contrary, that there was of necessity some\\nother more perfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and from whom I had\\nreceived all that I possessed; for if I had existed alone, and\\nindependently of every other being, so as to have had from myself all\\nthe perfection, however little, which I actually possessed, I should\\nhave been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole\\nremainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus\\ncould of myself have become infinite, eternal, immutable, omniscient,\\nall-powerful, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I\\ncould recognize in God.  For in order to know the nature of God (whose\\nexistence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as\\nmy own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the\\nproperties of which I found in my  mind some idea, whether their\\npossession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one\\nwhich indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest\\nwas awanting.  Thus I perceived that doubt, inconstancy,  sadness, and\\nsuch like, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been\\nhappy to be free from them.  Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and\\ncorporeal things; for although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and\\nthat all which I saw or imagined was false, I could not, nevertheless,\\ndeny that the ideas were in reality in my thoughts.  But, because I had\\nalready very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature\\nis distinct from the corporeal, and as I observed that all composition\\nis an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is\\nmanifestly a state of imperfection, I therefore determined that it\\ncould not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these two natures\\nand that consequently he was not so compounded; but that if there were\\nany bodies in the world, or even any intelligences, or other natures\\nthat were not wholly perfect, their existence depended on his power in\\nsuch a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment.\\n\\nI was disposed straightway to search for other truths and when I had\\nrepresented to myself the object of the geometers, which I conceived to\\nbe a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length,\\nbreadth, and height or depth, divisible into divers parts which admit\\nof different figures and sizes, and of being moved or transposed in all\\nmanner of ways (for all this the geometers suppose to be in the object\\nthey contemplate), I went over some of their simplest demonstrations.\\nAnd, in the first place, I observed, that the great certitude which by\\ncommon consent is accorded to these demonstrations, is founded solely\\nupon this, that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules\\nI have already laid down In the next place, I perceived that there was\\nnothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the\\nexistence of their object: thus, for example, supposing a triangle to\\nbe given, I distinctly perceived that its three angles were necessarily\\nequal to two right angles, but I did not on that account perceive\\nanything which could assure me that any triangle existed:  while, on\\nthe contrary, recurring to the examination of the idea of a Perfect\\nBeing, I found that the existence of the Being was comprised in the\\nidea in the same way that the equality of its three angles to two right\\nangles is comprised in the idea of a triangle, or as in the idea of a\\nsphere, the equidistance of all points on its surface from the center,\\nor even still more clearly; and that consequently it is at least as\\ncertain that God, who is this Perfect Being, is, or exists, as any\\ndemonstration of geometry can be.\\n\\nBut the reason which leads many to persuade them selves that there is a\\ndifficulty in knowing this truth, and even also in knowing what their\\nmind really is, is that they never raise their thoughts above sensible\\nobjects, and are so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of\\nimagination, which is a mode of thinking limited to material objects,\\nthat all that is not imaginable seems to them not intelligible.  The\\ntruth of this is sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance,\\nthat the philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that there is\\nnothing in the understanding which was not previously in the senses, in\\nwhich however it is certain that the ideas of God and of the soul have\\nnever been; and it appears to me that they who make use of their\\nimagination to comprehend these ideas do exactly the some thing as if,\\nin order to hear sounds or smell odors, they strove to avail themselves\\nof their eyes; unless indeed that there is this difference, that the\\nsense of sight does not afford us an inferior assurance to those of\\nsmell or hearing; in place of which, neither our imagination nor our\\nsenses can give us assurance of anything unless our understanding\\nintervene.\\n\\nFinally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded\\nof the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced,\\nI am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of\\nthe truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that\\nwe have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like,\\nare less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these\\nthings, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance\\nin doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his\\nintellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a\\nmetaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude\\nentire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the\\nsame way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see\\nother stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind.  For\\nhow do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false\\nrather than those other which we experience when awake, since the\\nformer are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter?  And\\nthough men of the highest genius study this question as long as they\\nplease, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason\\nwhich can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose\\nthe existence of God.  For, in the first place even the principle which\\nI have already taken as a rule, viz., that all the things which we\\nclearly and distinctly conceive are true, is certain only because God\\nis or exists and because he is a Perfect Being, and because all that we\\npossess is derived from him:  whence it follows that our ideas or\\nnotions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are\\nreal, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true.  Accordingly,\\nwhereas we not infrequently have ideas or notions in which some falsity\\nis contained, this can only be the case with such as are to some extent\\nconfused and obscure, and in this proceed from nothing (participate of\\nnegation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly\\nperfect.  And it is evident that it is not less repugnant that falsity\\nor imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from\\nGod, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing.  But if\\nwe did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds\\nfrom a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas\\nmight be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance\\nthat they possessed the perfection of being true.\\n\\nBut after the knowledge of God and of the soul has rendered us certain\\nof this rule, we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts\\nwe experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be\\ncalled in question on account of the illusions of our dreams.  For if\\nit happened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very\\ndistinct idea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new\\ndemonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate\\nagainst its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams,\\nwhich consists in their representing to us various objects in the same\\nway as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us\\nvery properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are\\nnot infrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when\\npersons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or\\nbodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are.\\nFor, in fine, whether awake or asleep, we ought never to allow\\nourselves to be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the\\nevidence of our reason.  And it must be noted that I say of our reason,\\nand not of our imagination or of our senses:  thus, for example,\\nalthough we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to\\ndetermine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight\\npresents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined\\nto the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the\\nconclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason\\nthat what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly\\ntells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth; for\\notherwise it could not be that God, who is wholly perfect and\\nveracious, should have placed them in us.  And because our reasonings\\nare never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake,\\nalthough sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and\\ndistinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, reason further\\ndictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our\\npartial imperfection, those possessing truth must infallibly be found\\nin the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our\\ndreams.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART V\\n\\nI would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of\\ntruths which I deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it\\nwould have been necessary now to treat of many questions in dispute\\namong the earned, with whom I do not wish to be embroiled, I believe\\nthat it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition, and only\\nmention in general what these truths are, that the more judicious may\\nbe able to determine whether a more special account of them would\\nconduce to the public advantage.  I have ever remained firm in my\\noriginal resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I\\nhave recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and\\nof the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me\\nmore clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had\\nformerly appeared; and yet I venture to state that not only have I\\nfound means to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal\\ndifficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy, but I have\\nalso observed certain laws established in nature by God in such a\\nmanner, and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions, that\\nafter we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that\\nthey are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the\\nworld and farther, by considering the concatenation of these laws, it\\nappears to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and more\\nimportant than all I had before learned, or even had expected to learn.\\n\\nBut because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discoveries in\\na treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I\\ncannot make the results known more conveniently than by here giving a\\nsummary of the contents of this treatise.  It was my design to comprise\\nin it all that, before I set myself to write it, I thought I knew of\\nthe nature of material objects.  But like the painters who, finding\\nthemselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the\\ndifferent faces of a solid body, select one of the chief, on which\\nalone they make the light fall, and throwing the rest into the shade,\\nallow them to appear only in so far as they can be seen while looking\\nat the principal one; so, fearing lest I should not be able to compense\\nin my discourse all that was in my mind, I resolved to expound singly,\\nthough at considerable length, my opinions regarding light; then to\\ntake the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed\\nstars, since light almost wholly proceeds from them; on the heavens\\nsince they transmit it; on the planets, comets, and earth, since they\\nreflect it; and particularly on all the bodies that are upon the earth,\\nsince they are either colored, or transparent, or luminous; and finally\\non man, since he is the spectator of these objects.  Further, to enable\\nme to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to\\nexpress my judgment regarding them with greater freedom, without being\\nnecessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned, I resolved\\nto leave all the people here to their disputes, and to speak only of\\nwhat would happen in a new world, if God were now to create somewhere\\nin the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one, and were to\\nagitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so\\nthat there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned,\\nand after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to\\nnature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had\\nestablished.  On this supposition, I, in the first place, described\\nthis matter, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my\\nmind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible, except what\\nhas been recently said regarding God and the soul; for I even expressly\\nsupposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are\\nso debated in the schools, nor in general anything the knowledge of\\nwhich is not so natural to our minds that no one can so much as imagine\\nhimself ignorant of it.  Besides, I have pointed out what are the laws\\nof nature; and, with no other principle upon which to found my\\nreasonings except the infinite perfection of God, I endeavored to\\ndemonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt,\\nand to prove that they are such, that even if God had created more\\nworlds, there could have been none in which these laws were not\\nobserved.  Thereafter, I showed how the greatest part of the matter of\\nthis chaos must, in accordance with these laws, dispose and arrange\\nitself in such a way as to present the appearance of heavens; how in\\nthe meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets\\nand comets, and others a sun and fixed stars.  And, making a digression\\nat this stage on the subject of light, I expounded at considerable\\nlength what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun\\nand the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the\\nimmense spaces of the heavens, and how from the planets and comets it\\nis reflected towards the earth.  To this I likewise added much\\nrespecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and all the\\ndifferent qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had\\nsaid enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in\\nthe heavens or stars of our system that must not, or at least may not\\nappear precisely alike in those of the system which I described.  I\\ncame next to speak of the earth in particular, and to show how, even\\nthough I had expressly supposed that God had given no weight to the\\nmatter of which it is composed, this should not prevent all its parts\\nfrom tending exactly to its center; how with water and air on its\\nsurface, the disposition of the heavens and heavenly bodies, more\\nespecially of the moon, must cause a flow and ebb, like in all its\\ncircumstances to that observed in our seas, as also a certain current\\nboth of water and air from east to west, such as is likewise observed\\nbetween the tropics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers\\nmight naturally be formed in it, and the metals produced in the mines,\\nand the plants grow in the fields and in general, how all the bodies\\nwhich are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated\\nand, among other things in the discoveries alluded to inasmuch as\\nbesides the stars, I knew nothing except fire which produces light, I\\nspared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature,--the\\nmanner of its production and support, and to explain how heat is\\nsometimes found without light, and light without heat; to show how it\\ncan induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse\\nqualities; how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others;\\nhow it can consume almost all bodies, or convert them into ashes and\\nsmoke; and finally, how from these ashes, by the mere intensity of its\\naction, it forms glass:  for as this transmutation of ashes into glass\\nappeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature, I took a special\\npleasure in describing it.  I was not, however, disposed, from these\\ncircumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the\\nmanner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the\\nfirst such as it was to be.  But this is certain, and an opinion\\ncommonly received among theologians, that the action by which he now\\nsustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it; so\\nthat even although he had from the beginning given it no other form\\nthan that of chaos, provided only he had established certain laws of\\nnature, and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is\\nwont to do, it may be believed, without discredit to the miracle of\\ncreation, that, in this way alone, things purely material might, in\\ncourse of time, have become such as we observe them at present; and\\ntheir nature is much more easily conceived when they are beheld coming\\nin this manner gradually into existence, than when they are only\\nconsidered as produced at once in a finished and perfect state.\\n\\nFrom the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to\\nanimals, and particularly to man.  But since I had not as yet\\nsufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner\\nas of the rest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes,\\nand by showing from what elements and in what manner nature must\\nproduce them, I remained satisfied with the supposition that God formed\\nthe body of man wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external\\nshape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs, of\\nthe same matter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no\\nrational soul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or\\nsensitive soul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without\\nlight, such as I had already described, and which I thought was not\\ndifferent from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it\\nis dry, or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are\\nrun clear of the fruit.  For, when I examined the kind of functions\\nwhich might, as consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I\\nfound precisely all those which may exist in us independently of all\\npower of thinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing\\nto the soul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from\\nthe body, and of which it has been said above that the nature\\ndistinctively consists in thinking, functions in which the animals void\\nof reason may be said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could\\nnot discover any of those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong\\nto us as men, while, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these\\nas soon as I supposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have\\nannexed it to this body in a particular manner which I described.\\n\\nBut, in order to show how I there handled this matter, I mean here to\\ngive the explication of the motion of the heart and arteries, which, as\\nthe first and most general motion observed in animals, will afford the\\nmeans of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest.\\nAnd that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about\\nto say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy,\\nbefore they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the\\ntrouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large\\nanimal possessed of lungs (for this is throughout sufficiently like the\\nhuman), and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities:  in\\nthe first place, that in the right side, with which correspond two very\\nample tubes, viz., the hollow vein (vena cava), which is the principal\\nreceptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree, as it were, of\\nwhich all the other veins in the body are branches; and the arterial\\nvein (vena arteriosa), inappropriately so denominated, since it is in\\ntruth only an artery, which, taking its rise in the heart, is divided,\\nafter passing out from it, into many branches which presently disperse\\nthemselves all over the lungs; in the second place, the cavity in the\\nleft side, with which correspond in the same manner two canals in size\\nequal to or larger than the preceding, viz., the venous artery (arteria\\nvenosa), likewise inappropriately thus designated, because it is simply\\na vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided into many\\nbranches, interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and those of the\\ntube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe enters; and\\nthe great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its branches all\\nover the body.  I should wish also that such persons were carefully\\nshown the eleven pellicles which, like so many small valves, open and\\nshut the four orifices that are in these two cavities, viz., three at\\nthe entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a\\nmanner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from\\nflowing into the right ventricle of the heart, and yet exactly to\\nprevent its flowing out; three at the entrance to the arterial vein,\\nwhich, arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former, readily\\npermit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but\\nhinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity; and,\\nin like manner, two others at the mouth of the venous artery, which\\nallow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the\\nheart, but preclude its return; and three at the mouth of the great\\nartery, which suffer the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its\\nreflux.  Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of\\nthese pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being\\nof an oval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately\\nclosed with two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently\\nclosed with three.  Besides, I wish such persons to observe that the\\ngrand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer\\ntexture than the venous artery and the hollow vein; and that the two\\nlast expand before entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two\\npouches denominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a\\nsubstance similar to that of the heart itself; and that there is always\\nmore warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body--and\\nfinally, that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that\\npasses into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate, just as all\\nliquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated\\nvessel.\\n\\nFor, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything\\nmore with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when\\nits cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity\\nflows,--from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery\\ninto the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and\\ntheir orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be\\nclosed.  But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into\\neach of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large,\\nbecause the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels\\nfrom which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and\\ndilated by the heat they meet with.  In this way they cause the whole\\nheart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five\\nsmall valves that are at the entrances of the two vessels from which\\nthey flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the\\nheart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six\\nsmall valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through\\nwhich they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the\\narterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously\\nwith the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do\\nalso the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled,\\nand the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of\\nthe venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of\\nblood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as\\nbefore.  And, because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes\\nthrough these two pouches called auricles, it thence happens that their\\nmotion is the contrary of that of the heart, and that when it expands\\nthey contract.  But lest those who are ignorant of the force of\\nmathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish\\ntrue reasons from mere verisimilitudes, should venture, without\\nexamination, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considered\\nthat the motion which I have now explained follows as necessarily from\\nthe very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart\\nby the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers,\\nand from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does\\nthe motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its\\ncounterweights and wheels.\\n\\nBut if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins, flowing\\nin this way continually into the heart, is not exhausted, and why the\\narteries do not become too full, since all the blood which passes\\nthrough the heart flows into them, I need only mention in reply what\\nhas been written by a physician of England, who has the honor of having\\nbroken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach\\nthat there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries,\\nthrough which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the\\nsmall branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so\\nthat its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation.  Of this\\nwe have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons, who, by\\nbinding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where\\nthey open the vein, cause the blood to flow more copiously than it\\nwould have done without any ligature; whereas quite the contrary would\\nhappen were they to bind it below; that is, between the hand and the\\nopening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight.\\nFor it is manifest that the tie, moderately straightened, while\\nadequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards\\nthe heart by the veins, cannot on that account prevent new blood from\\ncoming forward through the arteries, because these are situated below\\nthe veins, and their coverings, from their greater consistency, are\\nmore difficult to compress; and also that the blood which comes from\\nthe heart tends to pass through them to the hand with greater force\\nthan it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins.\\nAnd since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made\\nin one of the veins, there must of necessity be certain passages below\\nthe ligature, that is, towards the extremities of the arm through which\\nit can come thither from the arteries.  This physician likewise\\nabundantly establishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of\\nthe blood, from the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in\\nvarious places along the course of the veins, in the manner of small\\nvalves, as not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body\\ntowards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities to the\\nheart; and farther, from experience which shows that all the blood\\nwhich is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a\\nsingle artery that has been cut, even although this had been closely\\ntied in the immediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the\\nheart and the ligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood\\nflowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart.\\n\\nBut there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have\\nalleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood:  thus, in the\\nfirst place, the difference that  is observed between the blood which\\nflows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from\\nthis, that being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled by passing\\nthrough the heart, it is thinner, and more vivid, and warmer\\nimmediately after leaving the heart, in other words, when in the\\narteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other\\nwords, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it will be\\nfound that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of\\nthe heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it.  In the\\nnext place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and\\nthe great artery are  composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is\\nimpelled  against them with more force than against the veins.  And why\\nshould the left cavity of the heart and the  great artery be wider and\\nlarger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that\\nthe blood of the  venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it\\nhas passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily,\\nand in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from\\nthe hollow vein?  And what can physicians conjecture from feeling the\\npulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature\\nit can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower\\ndegree, and more or less quickly than before?  And if it be inquired\\nhow this heat is communicated to the other members, must it not be\\nadmitted that this is effected by means of the blood, which, passing\\nthrough the heart, is there heated anew, and thence diffused over all\\nthe body?  Whence it happens, that if the blood be withdrawn from any\\npart, the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means; and although\\nthe heart were as-hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of\\nwarming the feet and hands as at present, unless it continually sent\\nthither new blood.  We likewise perceive from this, that the true use\\nof respiration is to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs, to\\ncause the blood which flows into them from the right ventricle of the\\nheart, where it has been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapors,\\nto become thick, and to convert it anew into blood, before it flows\\ninto the left cavity, without which process it would be unfit for the\\nnourishment of the fire that is there.  This receives confirmation from\\nthe circumstance, that it is observed of animals destitute of lungs\\nthat they have also but one cavity in the heart, and that in children\\nwho cannot use them while in the womb, there is a hole through which\\nthe blood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart,\\nand a tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the\\ngrand artery without passing through the lung.  In the next place, how\\ncould digestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart\\ncommunicated heat to it through the arteries, and along with this\\ncertain of the more fluid parts of the blood, which assist in the\\ndissolution of the food that has been taken in?  Is not also the\\noperation which converts the juice of food into blood easily\\ncomprehended, when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and\\nrepassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times\\nin a day?  And what more need be adduced to explain nutrition, and the\\nproduction of the different humors of the body, beyond saying, that the\\nforce with which the blood, in being rarefied, passes from the heart\\ntowards the extremities of the arteries, causes certain of its parts to\\nremain in the members at which they arrive, and there occupy the place\\nof some others expelled by them; and that according to the situation,\\nshape, or smallness of the pores with which they meet, some rather\\nthan others flow into certain parts, in the same way that some sieves\\nare observed to act, which, by being variously perforated, serve to\\nseparate different species of grain?  And, in the last place, what\\nabove all is here worthy of observation, is the generation of the\\nanimal spirits, which are like a very subtle wind, or rather a very\\npure and vivid flame which, continually ascending in great abundance\\nfrom the heart to the brain, thence penetrates through the nerves into\\nthe muscles, and gives motion to all the members; so that to account\\nfor other parts of the blood which, as most agitated and penetrating,\\nare the fittest to compose these spirits, proceeding towards the brain,\\nit is not necessary to suppose any other cause, than simply, that the\\narteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart in the most\\ndirect lines, and that, according to the rules of mechanics which are\\nthe same with those of nature, when many objects tend at once to the\\nsame point where there is not sufficient room for all (as is the case\\nwith the parts of the blood which flow forth from the left cavity of\\nthe heart and tend towards the brain), the weaker and less agitated\\nparts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger\\nwhich alone in this way reach it I had expounded all these matters with\\nsufficient minuteness in the treatise which I formerly thought of\\npublishing.  And after these, I had shown what must be the fabric of\\nthe nerves and muscles of the human body to give the animal spirits\\ncontained in it the power to move the members, as when we see heads\\nshortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth,\\nalthough no longer animated; what changes must take place in the brain\\nto produce waking, sleep, and dreams; how light, sounds, odors, tastes,\\nheat, and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with\\ndifferent ideas by means of the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the\\nother internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas;\\nwhat must be understood by the common sense (sensus communis) in which\\nthese ideas are received, by the memory which retains them, by the\\nfantasy which can change them in various ways, and out of them compose\\nnew ideas, and which, by the same means, distributing the animal\\nspirits through the muscles, can cause the members of such a body to\\nmove in as many different ways, and in a manner as suited, whether to\\nthe objects that are presented to its senses or to its internal\\naffections, as can take place in our own case apart from the guidance\\nof the will.  Nor will this appear at all strange to those who are\\nacquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different\\nautomata, or moving machines fabricated by human industry, and that\\nwith help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones,\\nmuscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other parts that are found in the\\nbody of each animal.  Such persons will look upon this body as a\\nmachine made by the hands of God, which is incomparably better\\narranged, and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine\\nof human invention.  And here I specially stayed to show that, were\\nthere such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape\\nor any other irrational animal, we could have no means of knowing that\\nthey were in any respect of a different nature from these animals; but\\nif there were machines bearing the image of our bodies, and capable of\\nimitating our actions as far as it is morally possible, there would\\nstill remain two most certain tests whereby to know that they were not\\ntherefore really men.  Of these the first is that they could never use\\nwords or other signs arranged in such a manner as is competent to us in\\norder to declare our thoughts to others:  for we may easily conceive a\\nmachine to be so constructed that it emits vocables, and even that it\\nemits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects\\nwhich cause a change in its organs; for example, if touched in a\\nparticular place it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in another\\nit may cry out that it is hurt, and such like; but not that it should\\narrange them variously so as appositely to reply to what is said in its\\npresence, as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do.  The second\\ntest is, that although such machines might execute many things with\\nequal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they would, without\\ndoubt, fail in certain others from which it could be discovered that\\nthey did not act from knowledge, but solely from the disposition of\\ntheir organs:  for while reason is an universal instrument that is\\nalike available on every occasion, these organs, on the contrary, need\\na particular arrangement for each particular action; whence it must be\\nmorally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity\\nof organs sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrences of\\nlife, in the way in which our reason enables us to act.  Again, by\\nmeans of these two tests we may likewise know the difference between\\nmen and brutes.  For it is highly deserving of remark, that there are\\nno men so dull and stupid, not even idiots, as to be incapable of\\njoining together different words, and thereby constructing a\\ndeclaration by which to make their thoughts understood; and that on the\\nother hand, there is no other animal, however perfect or happily\\ncircumstanced, which can do the like.  Nor does this inability arise\\nfrom want of organs:  for we observe that magpies and parrots can utter\\nwords like ourselves, and are yet unable to speak as we do, that is, so\\nas to show that they understand what they say; in place of which men\\nborn deaf and dumb, and thus not less, but rather more than the brutes,\\ndestitute of the organs which others use in speaking, are in the habit\\nof spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their\\nthoughts to those who, being usually in their company, have leisure to\\nlearn their language.  And this proves not only that the brutes have\\nless reason than man, but that they have none at all:  for we see that\\nvery little is required to enable a person to speak; and since a\\ncertain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same\\nspecies, as well as among men, and since some are more capable of being\\ninstructed than others, it is incredible that the most perfect ape or\\nparrot of its species, should not in this be equal to the most stupid\\ninfant of its kind or at least to one that was crack-brained, unless\\nthe soul of brutes were of a nature wholly different from ours.  And we\\nought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate\\nthe passions, and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by\\nanimals; nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients, that the\\nbrutes speak, although we do not understand their language.  For if\\nsuch were the case, since they are endowed with many organs analogous\\nto ours, they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to\\ntheir fellows.  It is also very worthy of remark, that, though there\\nare many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of\\ntheir actions, the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in\\nmany others:  so that the circumstance that they do better than we does\\nnot prove that they are endowed with mind, for it would thence follow\\nthat they possessed greater reason than any of us, and could surpass us\\nin all things; on the contrary, it rather proves that they are\\ndestitute of reason, and that it is nature which acts in them according\\nto the disposition of their organs:  thus it is seen, that a clock\\ncomposed only of wheels and weights can number the hours and measure\\ntime more exactly than we with all our skin.\\n\\nI had after this described the reasonable soul, and shown that it could\\nby no means be educed from the power of matter, as the other things of\\nwhich I had spoken, but that it must be expressly created; and that it\\nis not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a\\npilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is\\nnecessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in\\norder to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus\\nconstitute a real man.  I here entered, in conclusion, upon the subject\\nof the soul at considerable length, because it is of the greatest\\nmoment:  for after the error of those who deny the existence of God, an\\nerror which I think I have already sufficiently refuted, there is none\\nthat is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight\\npath of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brutes is of\\nthe same nature with our own; and consequently that after this life we\\nhave nothing to hope for or fear, more than flies and ants; in place of\\nwhich, when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the\\nreasons which establish that the soul is of a nature wholly independent\\nof the body, and that consequently it is not liable to die with the\\nlatter and, finally, because no other causes are observed capable of\\ndestroying it, we are naturally led thence to judge that it is immortal.\\n\\n\\n\\nPART VI\\n\\nThree years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing\\nall these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to\\nput it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom\\nI greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less\\ninfluential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a\\ncertain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by\\nanother individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only\\nthat, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I\\ncould imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and\\nnothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression\\nto it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led\\nme to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found\\nin which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care\\nI have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had\\nnot the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to\\naught that might tend to the hurt of any one.  This has been sufficient\\nto make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the\\nreasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very\\nstrong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing\\nbooks, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations\\nsufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task.  And these\\nreasons, on one side and the other, are such, that not only is it in\\nsome measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public,\\nperhaps, to know them.\\n\\nI have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind;\\nand so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ\\nbeyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the\\nspeculative sciences, or endeavoring to regulate my actions according\\nto the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish\\nanything respecting it.  For in what regards manners, every one is so\\nfull of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as\\nheads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending\\nthem, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his\\npeople or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be\\nprophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I\\nbelieved that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more.\\nBut as soon as I had acquired some general notions respecting physics,\\nand beginning to make trial of them in various particular difficulties,\\nhad observed how far they can carry us, and how much they differ from\\nthe principles that have been employed up to the present time, I\\nbelieved that I could not keep them concealed without sinning\\ngrievously against the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as\\nin us lies, the general good of mankind.  For by them I perceived it to\\nbe possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life; and in room\\nof the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to\\ndiscover a practical, by means of which, knowing the force and action\\nof fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies\\nthat surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our\\nartisans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to\\nwhich they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and\\npossessors of nature.  And this is a result to be desired, not only in\\norder to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be\\nenabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all\\nits comforts, but also and especially for the preservation of health,\\nwhich is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, the first\\nand fundamental one; for the mind is so intimately dependent upon the\\ncondition and relation of the organs of the body, that if any means can\\never be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I\\nbelieve that it is in medicine they must be sought for.  It is true\\nthat the science of medicine, as it now exists, contains few things\\nwhose utility is very remarkable:  but without any wish to depreciate\\nit, I am confident that there is no one, even among those whose\\nprofession it is, who does not admit that all at present known in it is\\nalmost nothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; and that\\nwe could free ourselves from an infinity of maladies of body as well as\\nof mind, and perhaps also even from the debility of age, if we had\\nsufficiently ample knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies\\nprovided for us by nature.  But since I designed to employ my whole\\nlife in the search after so necessary a science, and since I had fallen\\nin with a path which seems to me such, that if any one follow it he\\nmust inevitably reach the end desired, unless he be hindered either by\\nthe shortness of life or the want of experiments, I judged that there\\ncould be no more effectual provision against these two impediments than\\nif I were faithfully to communicate to the public all the little I\\nmight myself have found, and incite men of superior genius to strive to\\nproceed farther, by contributing, each according to his inclination and\\nability, to the experiments which it would be necessary to make, and\\nalso by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by\\nthe last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus\\nconnecting the lives and labours of many, we might collectively proceed\\nmuch farther than each by himself could do.\\n\\nI remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become\\nalways more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at\\nthe commencement, it is better to make use only of what is\\nspontaneously presented to our senses, and of which we cannot remain\\nignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than\\nto concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena:  the\\nreason of which is, that the more uncommon often only mislead us so\\nlong as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown; and the\\ncircumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and\\nminute as to be highly difficult to detect.  But in this I have adopted\\nthe following order:  first, I have essayed to find in general the\\nprinciples, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world,\\nwithout taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself\\nwho has created it, and without educing them from any other source than\\nfrom certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the\\nsecond place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects\\nthat could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in\\nthis way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth\\nwater, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which\\nof all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to\\nknow.  Afterwards when I wished to descend to the more particular, so\\nmany diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to\\nbe impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of\\nbodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might\\nhave been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently\\nto apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their\\neffects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments.\\nThereupon, turning over in my mind I the objects that had ever been\\npresented to my senses I freely venture to state that I have never\\nobserved any which I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles\\nhad discovered.  But it is necessary also to confess that the power of\\nnature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and\\ngeneral, that I have hardly observed a single particular effect which I\\ncannot at once recognize as capable of being deduced in man different\\nmodes from the principles, and that my greatest difficulty usually is\\nto discover in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them;\\nfor out of this difficulty cannot otherwise extricate myself than by\\nagain seeking certain experiments, which may be such that their result\\nis not the same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain\\nit, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other.  As to what\\nremains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient\\nclearness what course must be taken to make the majority those\\nexperiments which may conduce to this end:  but I perceive likewise\\nthat they are such and so numerous, that neither my hands nor my\\nincome, though it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be\\nsufficient for them all; so that according as henceforward I shall have\\nthe means of making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same\\nproportion make greater or less progress in the knowledge of nature.\\nThis was what I had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written,\\nand so clearly to exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the\\npublic, as to induce all who have the common good of man at heart, that\\nis, all who are virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or\\naccording to opinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they\\nhad already made, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.\\n\\nBut since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have\\nbeen led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go\\non committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment,\\nas soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same\\ncare upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish\\nthem.  This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus\\nafforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for\\ndoubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe\\nwill be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private\\nuse (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived\\nit, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing),\\nas because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the\\npublic, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings\\npossess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death\\nmay be able to put them to what use they deem proper.  But I resolved\\nby no means to consent to their publication during my lifetime, lest\\neither the oppositions or the controversies to which they might give\\nrise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would\\nacquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had\\nset apart for my own improvement.  For though it be true that every one\\nis bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others,\\nand that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is\\nlikewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it\\nis good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the\\nliving, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will\\nbe of much greater advantage to posterity.  And in truth, I am quite\\nwilling it should be known that the little I have hitherto learned is\\nalmost nothing in comparison with that of which I am ignorant, and to\\nthe knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it\\nis much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the\\nsciences, as with those who when growing rich find less difficulty in\\nmaking great acquisitions, than they formerly experienced when poor in\\nmaking acquisitions of much smaller amount.  Or they may be compared to\\nthe commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion\\nto their victories, and who need greater prudence to keep together the\\nresidue of their troops after a defeat than after a victory to take\\ntowns and provinces.  For he truly engages in battle who endeavors to\\nsurmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from\\nreaching the knowledge of truth, and he is overcome in fight who admits\\na false opinion touching a matter of any generality and importance, and\\nhe requires thereafter much more skill to recover his former position\\nthan to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly\\nascertained principles.  As for myself, if I have succeeded in\\ndiscovering any truths in the sciences (and I trust that what is\\ncontained in this volume I will show that I have found some), I can\\ndeclare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six\\nprincipal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with\\nwhich I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me.  I will\\nnot hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to\\nenable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar\\nvictories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that,\\naccording to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient\\nleisure for this end.  But I conceive myself the more bound to husband\\nthe time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to\\nemploy it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it,\\nwere I to publish the principles of my physics:  for although they are\\nalmost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than\\nsimply to understand them, and although there is not one of them of\\nwhich I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is\\nimpossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinions\\nof others, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my\\ngrand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to\\nawaken.\\n\\nIt may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making\\nme aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of\\nvalue, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still\\nfarther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now\\nbeginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn\\nwith their discoveries.  But though I recognize my extreme liability to\\nerror, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me,\\nyet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views\\nprevents me from anticipating any profit from them.  For I have already\\nhad frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed\\nfriends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of\\nindifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew,\\ndetermine them to endeavor to discover what partiality concealed from\\nthe eyes of my friends.  But it has rarely happened that anything has\\nbeen objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it\\nwere something far removed from the subject:  so that I have never met\\nwith a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either\\nless rigorous or less equitable than myself.  And further, I have never\\nobserved that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the\\ndisputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives\\nfor the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere\\nverisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the\\nquestion; and those who have been long good advocates are not\\nafterwards on that account the better judges.\\n\\nAs for the advantage that others would derive from the communication of\\nmy thoughts, it could not be very great; because I have not yet so far\\nprosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they\\ncan be applied to practice.  And I think I may say without vanity, that\\nif there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be\\nmyself rather than another:  not that there may not be in the world\\nmany minds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so\\nwell seize a thing and make it one\\'s own, when it has been learned from\\nanother, as when one has himself discovered it.  And so true is this of\\nthe present subject that, though I have often explained some of my\\nopinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking,\\nappeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated\\nthem, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an\\nextent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine.  I am glad, by\\nthe way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to\\nbelieve on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not\\nbeen published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the\\nextravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own\\nwritings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that\\naccount suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the\\nablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely\\nrepresented to us.  It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a\\nsingle instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am\\nquite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle\\nwould think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as\\nhe possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never\\nafterwards attain to higher.  In this respect they are like the ivy\\nwhich never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which\\nfrequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it\\nseems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less\\nwise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with\\nknowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in\\naddition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he\\nsays not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought.  Their fashion\\nof philosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities\\nfall below mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and\\nprinciples of which they make use enables them to speak of all things\\nwith as much confidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all\\nthat they say on any subject against the most subtle and skillful,\\nwithout its being possible for any one to convict them of error.  In\\nthis they seem to me to be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on\\nequal terms with a person that sees, should have made him descend to\\nthe bottom of an intensely dark cave:  and I may say that such persons\\nhave an interest in my refraining from publishing the principles of the\\nphilosophy of which I make use; for, since these are of a kind the\\nsimplest and most evident, I should, by publishing them, do much the\\nsame as if I were to throw open the windows, and allow the light of day\\nto enter the cave into which the combatants had descended.  But even\\nsuperior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these\\nprinciples, for if what they desire is to be able to speak of all\\nthings, and to acquire a reputation for learning, they will gain their\\nend more easily by remaining satisfied with the appearance of truth,\\nwhich can be found without much difficulty in all sorts of matters,\\nthan by seeking the truth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and\\nthat only in some departments, while it obliges us, when we have to\\nspeak of others, freely to confess our ignorance.  If, however, they\\nprefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of appearing\\nignorant of none, as such knowledge is undoubtedly much to be\\npreferred, and, if they choose to follow a course similar to mine, they\\ndo not require for this that I should say anything more than I have\\nalready said in this discourse.  For if they are capable of making\\ngreater advancement than I have made, they will much more be able of\\nthemselves to discover all that I believe myself to have found; since\\nas I have never examined aught except in order, it is certain that what\\nyet remains to be discovered is in itself more difficult and recondite,\\nthan that which I have already been enabled to find, and the\\ngratification would be much less in learning it from me than in\\ndiscovering it for themselves.  Besides this, the habit which they will\\nacquire, by seeking first what is easy, and then passing onward slowly\\nand step by step to the more difficult, will benefit them more than all\\nmy instructions.  Thus, in my own case, I am persuaded that if I had\\nbeen taught from my youth all the truths of which I have since sought\\nout demonstrations, and had thus learned them without labour, I should\\nnever, perhaps, have known any beyond these; at least, I should never\\nhave acquired the habit and the facility which I think I possess in\\nalways discovering new truths in proportion as I give myself to the\\nsearch.  And, in a single word, if there is any work in the world which\\ncannot be so well finished by another as by him who has commenced it,\\nit is that at which I labour.\\n\\nIt is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to\\nthis end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but\\nyet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands\\nbesides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same kind,\\nwhom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great\\nefficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was\\nprescribed to them.  For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire\\nof learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services,\\nbesides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and\\nthat they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized,\\nthey will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by\\nthe explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and\\nuseless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time\\nwithout loss to himself.  And as for the experiments that others have\\nalready made, even although these parties should be willing of\\nthemselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem\\nthem secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part,\\naccompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to\\nmake it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its\\nadjuncts--besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or\\neven so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them\\nonly such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that,\\nif in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his\\npurpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would\\nbe necessary to make the selection.  So that if there existed any one\\nwhom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the\\nhighest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and\\nif all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in\\nsuccessfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do\\naught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the\\nexperiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his\\nbeing deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any\\none.  But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as\\nto be willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on\\nimaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much\\ninterested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so\\nmean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favor of which it\\ncould be supposed that I was unworthy.\\n\\nThese considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last\\nthree years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on\\nhand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no\\nother that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics\\nmight be understood.  But since then, two other reasons have come into\\noperation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular\\nspecimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs.\\nOf these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many\\nwho were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings,\\nmight have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from\\nso doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I\\nam not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to\\nsay, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to\\nrepose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the\\nsame time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were\\ncrimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown;\\nand this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct\\na wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me\\nsome sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the\\nperfect mental tranquillity which I court.  And forasmuch as, while\\nthus indifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I\\nhave yet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of\\nreputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save\\nmyself at least from being ill-spoken of.  The other reason that has\\ndetermined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is,\\nthat I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my\\ndesign of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of\\nexperiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make\\nwithout the assistance of others:  and, without flattering myself so\\nmuch as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I\\nam yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to\\nmyself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it\\nmatter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them\\nmany things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not\\ntoo much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could\\nhave promoted the accomplishment of my designs.\\n\\nAnd I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which\\nshould neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me\\nto expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet\\nbe sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the\\nsciences.  Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to\\nsay; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking\\nmyself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and,\\nto afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any\\nobjections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to\\nmy publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavor to\\nsubjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both\\nat once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not\\nengage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect\\nfrankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot\\nperceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defense of\\nthe matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new\\nmatte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing\\nto another.\\n\\nIf some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the\\n\"Dioptrics\" and \"Meteorics\" should offend at first sight, because I\\ncall them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I\\nrequest a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope\\nthose hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that\\nthe reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as\\nthe last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the\\nfirst are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their\\neffects.  Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which\\nthe logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority\\nof these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do\\nnot serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their\\nexistence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is\\nestablished by the reality of the effects.  Nor have I called them\\nhypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that\\nI think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have\\nalready expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do\\nso, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to\\nbuild some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my\\nprinciples, and my being blamed for it.  I refer to those who imagine\\nthat they can master in a day all that another has taken twenty years\\nto think out, as soon as he has spoken two or three words to them on\\nthe subject; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable\\nof perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and\\nlively.  As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no\\napology for them as new,--persuaded as I am that if their reasons be\\nwell considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to\\ncommon sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than\\nany others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast\\nof being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having\\nadopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been\\nheld by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their\\ntruth.\\n\\nThough artisans may not be able at once to execute the invention which\\nis explained in the \"Dioptrics,\" I do not think that any one on that\\naccount is entitled to condemn it; for since address and practice are\\nrequired in order so to make and adjust the machines described by me as\\nnot to overlook the smallest particular, I should not be less\\nastonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were\\nin one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely\\nhaving excellent sheets of music set up before him.  And if I write in\\nFrench, which is the language of my country, in preference to Latin,\\nwhich is that of my preceptors, it is because I expect that those who\\nmake use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be better judges of\\nmy opinions than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients\\nonly; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom\\nalone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial\\nto Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I\\nexpound them in the vulgar tongue.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the\\nprogress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to\\nbind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of\\nbeing able to fulfill; but this only will I say, that I have resolved\\nto devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation\\nthan that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which\\nshall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in\\nmedicine of greater certainty than those at present in use; and that my\\ninclination is so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to\\nsuch as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that\\nif, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I\\ndo not believe that I should have been able to succeed.  Of this I here\\nmake a public declaration, though well aware that it cannot serve to\\nprocure for me any consideration in the world, which, however, I do not\\nin the least affect; and I shall always hold myself more obliged to\\nthose through whose favor I am permitted to enjoy my retirement without\\ninterruption than to any who might offer me the highest earthly\\npreferments.\\n',\n",
              " 'Title: Fathers and Sons\\n\\nAuthor: Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev\\n\\n\\nFATHERS AND SONS\\n\\nBY\\n\\nIVAN S. TURGENEV\\n\\nTranslated from the Russian by C.J. Hogarth\\n\\n\\nLONDON & TORONTO\\n\\nPUBLISHED BY J.M. DENT & SONS LTD & IN NEW YORK\\n\\nBY E.P. DUTTON & CO\\n\\n1921\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\n\\nIn this masterly unromantic novel, Turgenev drew a character, Bazarov,\\nwho served to express what he taught us to call Nihilism, and made\\na movement into a man. In Russia itself the effect of the story was\\nastonishing. The portrait of Bazarov was immediately and angrily\\nresented as a cold travesty. The portraits of the \"backwoodsmen,\" or\\nretired aristocrats, fared no better. Turgenev had indeed roused the\\nire of both sides, only too surely.\\n\\nThe Petrovitchs, typical figures as he designed them of the Russian\\nnobility, were intended he confessed to breathe \"feebleness,\\nnonchalance, narrowness of mind.\" His sense of fitness made him paint\\nwith extreme care these choice representatives of their class. They\\nwere the pick, and if they were humanly ineffective, what of their\\nweaker kind? \"Si la crême est mauvaise, que sera le lait?\" as he\\nput it. The bitterest criticism came, however, from the side of the\\nrevolutionaries and incompatibles. They felt in Turgenev the sharper\\nartistry and the intimate irony as if he had only used these qualities\\nin dealing with the specific case of Bazarov; whereas they were\\ntemperamental effects of his narrative art. He was ready to assert\\nhimself one of the party of youth. He was at one with Bazarov, he\\ndeclared, in nearly all his ideas, a chief exception being Bazarov\\'s\\nideas on art, which in truth are apt to be more crudely delivered than\\nthe rest of that iconoclast\\'s destructive opinions. Bazarov, he said\\nonce and again, was his favourite child.\\n\\nIt is nearly forty years now (in 1921) since the novel appeared in\\n_The Russian Messenger_, a weekly which was the recognised exponent\\nof the new movement. That proverbial period has lent a softer cast\\nto the lineaments of the people in the group, as time touches the\\ncanvas of the pictures in an old country-house gallery. But the\\ninteresting thing is to find that history in the large has terribly and\\nirresistibly confirmed the history in little that Turgenev drew, with a\\nsure instinct, for the potential anticipations of his saga.\\n\\nBut we should be wrong if we mistook its clear pervading realities\\nfor those of a tract-novel, or a document of any one particular\\ngeneration. It is as its title declares in a sense another fable of\\nthe inevitable coil and recoil of the two generations. The sympathetic\\npower of Turgenev is shown in his instinctive understanding of them\\nboth. An aristocrat by training, he was saved as Tolstoi was from\\nsterilising his imaginative and dramatic powers by any sense of caste\\nand privilege. He loved the play of human nature, knew how to reckon\\nwith its foibles, its pride, habitual prejudices, and all tragic and\\ncomic susceptibilities. So he drew Bazarov, as a protagonist of the\\nrevolt against the old order and the protective habit of age. When\\nBazarov enters the house of Arkady\\'s father, he is like Don Quixote\\nentering the inn of his direst probation. If the parallel seems a\\ntrifle fantastic, it was yet one that Turgenev would let pass, since he\\naffirmed that Don Quixote himself was, in his inimitable extravagance,\\na type of the eternal spirit of revolution. And one would like, if\\nthere were room for it, to print as preamble to _Fathers and Sons_, the\\nessay in which its writer has compared the deeper essentials of Hamlet\\nand Quixote.\\n\\nWe must be satisfied instead to recall the direct event of the novel,\\nas it falls in his own record. The present writer, some years ago,\\nspent a spring at Ventnor in the Isle of Wight, and found the house\\non the sea-brink in which he stayed had been occupied by Turgenev at\\none time. Then and there it was, in 1860 and at Ventnor, that he had\\nthe first idea of this novel; and it is scarcely being too fanciful\\nto think that he imagined the home environment and the spacious vista\\nof the Russian provinces more fondly and more freely, because of his\\nbeing at a long remove from them in that small and confined seaside\\nnook of Ventnor. Already, we must remember, the liberation of the serf\\nhad taken place; and the ferment of liberal ideas was working in the\\nnew generation. As we look back, we see in our wisdom after the event,\\nhaving realised Turgenev for the novelist he was--an artist who was\\nfor ever adjusting the moment to the permanent in art--that it was\\ninevitable he should write this book, this tragi-comedy of age and\\nyouth, of the old order and the new, the conservating fathers and the\\nrevolutionary sons.\\n\\nE. R.\\n\\nThe following is the list of Turgenev\\'s chief works:\\n\\n/#\\n      ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF WORKS: Russian Life in the Interior:\\n      or, the Experiences of a Sportsman, from French version, by\\n      J.

Cannot you see them yet?\" asked a _barin_[1] of about\\nforty who, hatless, and clad in a dusty jacket over a pair of tweed\\nbreeches, stepped on to the verandah of a posting-house on the 20th\\nday of May, 1859. The person addressed was the _barin\\'s_ servant--a\\nround-cheeked young fellow with small, dull eyes and a chin adorned\\nwith a tuft of pale-coloured down.\\n\\nGlancing along the high road in a supercilious manner, the servant\\n(in whom everything, from the turquoise ear-ring to the dyed, pomaded\\nhair and the mincing gait, revealed the modern, the rising generation)\\nreplied: \"No, _barin_, I cannot.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" queried the _barin_.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" the servant affirmed.\\n\\nThe _barin_ sighed, and seated himself upon a bench. While he is\\nsitting there with his knees drawn under him and his eyes moodily\\nglancing to right and left, the reader may care to become better\\nacquainted with his personality.\\n\\nHis name was Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov, and he owned (some fifteen\\nversts from the posting-house) a respectable little property of about\\ntwo hundred souls (or, as, after that he had apportioned his peasantry\\nallotments, and set up a \"farm,\" he himself expressed it, a property\\n\"of two thousand _desiatini_\"[2]). His father, one of the generals\\nof 1812, had spent his life exclusively in military service as the\\ncommander, first of a brigade, and then of a division; and always he\\nhad been quartered in the provinces, where his rank had enabled him to\\ncut a not inconspicuous figure. As for Nikolai Petrovitch himself, he\\nwas born in Southern Russia (as also was his elder brother, Paul--of\\nwhom presently), and, until his fourteenth year, received his education\\namid a circle of hard-up governors, free-and-easy aides-de-camp, and\\nsundry staff and regimental officers. His mother came of the family of\\nthe Koliazins, and, known in maidenhood as Agathe, and subsequently as\\nAgathoklea Kuzminishna Kirsanov, belonged to the type of \"officer\\'s\\nlady.\" That is to say, she wore pompous mobcaps and rustling silk\\ndresses, was always the first to approach the cross in church, talked\\nvolubly and in a loud tone, of set practice admitted her sons to kiss\\nher hand in the morning, and never failed to bless them before retiring\\nto rest at night. In short, she lived the life which suited her. As\\nthe son of a general, Nikolai Petrovitch was bound--though he evinced\\nno particular bravery, and might even have seemed a coward--to follow\\nhis brother Paul\\'s example by entering the army; but unfortunately,\\nowing to the fact that, on the very day when there arrived the news of\\nhis commission, he happened to break his leg, it befell that, after\\ntwo months in bed, he rose to his feet a permanently lamed man. When\\nhis father had finished wringing his hands over the mischance, he sent\\nhis son to acquire a civilian education; whence it came about that\\nNikolai, at eighteen, found himself a student at the University of\\nSt. Petersburg. At the same period his brother obtained a commission\\nin one of the regiments of Guards; and, that being so, their father\\napportioned the two young men a joint establishment, and placed it\\nunder the more or less detached supervision of Ilya Koliazin, their\\nmaternal uncle and a leading _tchinovnik_.[3] That done, the father\\nreturned to his division and his wife, and only at rare intervals\\nsent his sons sheets of grey foolscap (scrawled and re-scrawled in\\nflamboyant calligraphy) to which there was appended, amid a bower of\\nlaborious flourishes, the signature \"Piotr Kirsanov, Major-General.\"\\nIn the year 1835 Nikolai Petrovitch obtained his university degree;\\nand in the same year General Kirsanov was retired for incompetence\\nat a review, and decided to transfer his quarters to St. Petersburg.\\nUnfortunately, just as he was on the point both of renting a house\\nnear the Tavritchesky Gardens and of being enrolled as a member of\\nthe English Club, a stroke put an end to his career, and Agathoklea\\nKuzminishna followed him soon afterwards, since never had she succeeded\\nin taking to the dull life of the capital, but always had hankered\\nafter the old provincial existence. Already during his parents\\'\\nlifetime, and to their no small vexation, Nikolai Petrovitch had\\ncontrived to fall in love with the daughter of a certain _tchinovnik_\\nnamed Prepolovensky, the landlord of his flat; and since the maiden was\\nnot only comely, but one of the type known as \"advanced\" (that is to\\nsay, she perused an occasional \"Science\" article in one newspaper or\\nanother), he married her out of hand as soon as the term of mourning\\nwas ended, and, abandoning the Ministry of Provincial Affairs to which,\\nthrough his father\\'s influence, he had been posted, embarked upon\\nconnubial felicity in a villa adjoining the Institute of Forestry.\\nThence, after a while, the couple removed to a diminutive, but in\\nevery way respectable, flat which could boast of a spotless vestibule\\nand an icy-cold drawing-room; and thence, again, they migrated to the\\ncountry, where they settled for good, and where, in due time, they\\nhad born to them a son Arkady. The existence of husband and wife\\nwas one of perfect comfort and tranquillity. Almost never were they\\nparted from one another, they read together, they played the piano\\ntogether, and they sang duets. Also, she would garden or superintend\\nthe poultry-yard, and he would set forth a-hunting, or see to the\\nmanagement of the estate. Meanwhile Arkady led an existence of equal\\ncalm and comfort, and grew, and waxed fat; until, in 1847, when ten\\nyears had been passed in this idyllic fashion, Kirsanov\\'s wife breathed\\nher last. The blow proved almost more than the husband could bear--so\\nmuch so that his head turned grey in a few weeks. Yet, though he sought\\ndistraction for his thoughts by going abroad, he felt constrained, in\\nthe following year, to return home, where, after a prolonged period of\\ninaction, he took up the subject of Industrial Reform. Next, in 1855,\\nhe sent his son to the University of St. Petersburg, and, for the same\\nreason, spent the following three winters in the capital, where he\\nseldom went out, but spent the greater part of his time in endeavouring\\nto fraternise with his son\\'s youthful acquaintances. The fourth winter,\\nhowever, he was prevented by various circumstances from spending in St.\\nPetersburg; and thus in the May of 1859 we see him--grey-headed, dusty,\\na trifle bent, and wholly middle-aged--awaiting his son\\'s home-coming\\nafter the elevation of the latter (in Nikolai\\'s own footsteps) to the\\ndignity of a graduate.\\n\\nPresently either a sense of decency or (more probably) a certain\\ndisinclination to remain immediately under his master\\'s eye led the\\nservant to withdraw to the entrance gates, and there to light a pipe.\\nNikolai Petrovitch, however, continued sitting with head bent, and his\\neyes contemplating the ancient steps of the verandah, up which a stout\\nspeckled hen was tap-tapping its way on a pair of splayed yellow legs,\\nand thereby causing an untidy, but fastidious-looking, cat to regard\\nit from the balustrade with marked disapproval. Meanwhile the sun\\nbeat fiercely down, and from the darkened interior of a neighbouring\\ngranary came a smell as of hot rye straw. Nikolai Petrovitch sank\\ninto a reverie. \"My son Arkady a graduate!\"--the words kept passing\\nand repassing through his mind. Again and again he tried to think of\\nsomething else, but always the same thought returned to him. Until\\neventually he reverted to the memory of his dead wife. \"Would that she\\nwere still with me!\" was his yearning reflection. Presently a fat blue\\npigeon alighted upon the roadway, and fell to taking a hasty drink from\\na pool beside the well. And almost at the instant that the spectacle of\\nthe bird caught Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s eye, his ear caught the sound of\\napproaching wheels.\\n\\n\"They are coming, I think,\" hazarded the servant as he stepped forward\\nthrough the gates.\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch sprang to his feet, and strained his eyes along the\\nroad. Yes, coming into view there was a _tarantass_,[4] drawn by three\\nstagehorses; and in the _tarantass_ there could be seen the band of a\\nstudent\\'s cap and the outlines of a familiar, well-beloved face.\\n\\n\"Arkasha, Arkasha!\" was Kirsanov\\'s cry as, running forward, he\\nwaved his arms. A few moments later he was pressing his lips to the\\nsun-tanned, dusty, hairless cheek of the newly-fledged graduate.\\n\\n\\n[1] Gentleman or squire.\\n\\n[2] The _desiatin_ = 2.86 acres.\\n\\n[3] Civil servant.\\n\\n[4] A species of four-wheeled carriage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but first give me a rub down, dearest Papa,\" said Arkady in a\\nvoice which, though a little hoarsened with travelling, was yet clear\\nand youthful. \"See! I am covering you with dust!\" he added as joyously\\nhe returned his father\\'s caresses.\\n\\n\"Oh, but that will not matter,\" said Nikolai Petrovitch with a loving,\\nreassuring smile as he gave the collar of his son\\'s blue cloak a\\ncouple of pats, and then did the same by his own jacket. Thereafter,\\ngently withdrawing from his son\\'s embrace, and beginning to lead the\\nway towards the inn yard, he added: \"Come this way, come this way. The\\nhorses will soon be ready.\"\\n\\nHis excitement seemed even to outdo his son\\'s, so much did he stammer\\nand stutter, and, at times, find himself at a loss for a word. Arkady\\nstopped him.\\n\\n\"Papa,\" he said, \"first let me introduce my good friend Bazarov, who is\\nthe comrade whom I have so often mentioned in letters to you, and who\\nhas been kind enough to come to us for a visit.\"\\n\\nAt once Nikolai Petrovitch wheeled round, and, approaching a tall man\\nwho, clad in a long coat with a tasselled belt, had just alighted from\\nthe _tarantass_, pressed the bare red hand which, after a pause, the\\nstranger offered him.\\n\\n\"I am indeed glad to see you!\" was Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s greeting, \"I am\\nindeed grateful to you for your kindness in paying us this visit! Alas,\\nI hope that, that----But first might I inquire your name?\"\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasiliev,\" replied the other in slow, but virile, accents\\nas, turning down the collar of his coat, he revealed his face more\\nclearly. Long and thin, with a high forehead which looked flattened\\nat the top and became sharpened towards the nose, the face had large,\\ngreenish eyes and long, sandy whiskers. The instant that the features\\nbrightened into a smile, however, they betokened self-assurance and\\nintellect.\\n\\n\"My dearest Evgenii Vasiliev\", Nikolai Petrovitch continued, \"I trust\\nthat whilst you are with us you will not find time hang heavy upon your\\nhands.\"\\n\\nBazarov gave his lips a slight twitch, but vouchsafed no reply\\nbeyond raising his cap--a movement which revealed the fact that the\\nprominent convolutions of the skull were by no means concealed by the\\nsuperincumbent mass of indeterminate-coloured hair.\\n\\n\"Now, Arkady,\" went on Nikolai Petrovitch as he turned to his son,\\n\"shall we have the horses harnessed at once, or should you prefer to\\nrest a little?\"\\n\\n\"Let us rest at home, Papa. So pray have the horses put to.\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" his father agreed. \"Peter! Bestir yourself, my good fellow!\"\\n\\nBeing what is known as a \"perfectly trained servant,\" Peter had neither\\napproached nor shaken hands with the young _barin_, but contented\\nhimself with a distant bow. He now vanished through the yard gates.\\n\\n\"Though I have come in the _koliaska_,\" said Nikolai Petrovitch, \"I\\nhave brought three fresh horses for the _tarantass_.\"\\n\\nArkady then drank some water from a yellow bowl proffered by the\\nlandlord, while Bazarov lighted a pipe, and approached the ostler, who\\nwas engaged in unharnessing the stagehorses.\\n\\n\"Only two can ride in the _koliaska_,\" continued Nikolai Petrovitch;\\n\"wherefore I am rather in a difficulty to know how your friend will----\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he can travel in the _tarantass_,\" interrupted Arkady. \"Moreover,\\ndo not stand on any ceremony with him, for, wonderful though he is, he\\nis also quite simple, as you will find for yourself.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch\\'s coachman brought out the horses, and Bazarov\\nremarked to the ostler:\\n\\n\"Come, bestir yourself, fat-beard!\"\\n\\n\"Did you hear that, Mitiusha?\" added another ostler who was standing\\nwith his hands thrust into the back slits of his blouse. \"The _barin_\\nhas just called you a fat-beard. And a fat-beard you are.\"\\n\\nFor answer Mitiusha merely cocked his cap to one side and drew the\\nreins from the back of the sweating shafts-horse.\\n\\n\"Quick now, my good fellows!\" cried Nikolai Petrovitch. \"Bear a hand,\\nall of you, and for each there will be a glassful of _vodka_.\"\\n\\nNaturally, it was not long before the horses were harnessed, and then\\nfather and son seated themselves in the _koliaska_, Peter mounted the\\nbox of that vehicle, and Bazarov stepped into the _tarantass_, and\\nlolled his head against the leather cushion at the back. Finally the\\ncortège moved away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\n\"To think that you are now a graduate and home again!\" said Nikolai\\nPetrovitch as he tapped Arkady on the knee, and then on the shoulder.\\n\"There now, there now!\"\\n\\n\"And how is Uncle? Is he quite well?\" asked Arkady--the reason for the\\nquestion being that though he felt filled with a genuine, an almost\\nchildish delight at his return, he also felt conscious of an instinct\\nthat the conversation were best diverted from the emotional to the\\nprosaic.\\n\\n\"Yes, your uncle is quite well. As a matter of fact, he also had\\narranged to come and meet you, but at the last moment changed his mind.\"\\n\\n\"Did you have very long to wait?\" continued Arkady.\\n\\n\"About five hours.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Papa!\" cried Arkady as, leaning over towards his father, he\\nimprinted upon his cheek a fervent kiss. Nikolai Petrovitch smiled\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"I have got a splendid horse for you,\" he next remarked. \"Presently you\\nshall see him. Also, your room has been entirely repapered.\"\\n\\n\"And have you a room for Bazarov as well?\"\\n\\n\"One shall be found for him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh--and pray humour him in every way you can. I could not express to\\nyou how much I value his friendship.\"\\n\\n\"But you have not known him very long, have you?\"\\n\\n\"No--not very long.\"\\n\\n\"I thought not, for I do not remember to have seen him in St.\\nPetersburg last winter. In what does he most interest himself?\"\\n\\n\"Principally in natural science. But, to tell the truth, he knows\\npractically _everything_, and is to become a doctor next year.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! So he is in the Medical Faculty?\" Nikolai Petrovitch remarked;\\nafter which there was silence for a moment.\\n\\n\"Peter,\" went on Nikolai, pointing with his hand, \"are not those\\npeasants there some of our own?\"\\n\\nPeter glanced in the direction indicated, and saw a few waggons\\nproceeding along a narrow by-road. The teams were bridleless, and in\\neach waggon were seated some two or three _muzhiks_ with their blouses\\nunbuttoned.\\n\\n\"Yes, they are some of our own,\" Peter responded.\\n\\n\"Then whither can they be going? To the town?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--or to the tavern.\" This last was added contemptuously, and with\\na wink to the coachman that was designed to enlist that functionary\\'s\\nsympathy: but as the functionary in question was one of the old school\\nwhich takes no share in the modern movement, he stirred not a muscle of\\nhis face.\\n\\n\"This year my peasants have been giving me a good deal of trouble,\"\\nNikolai Petrovitch continued to his son. \"Persistently do they refuse\\nto pay their tithes. What ought to be done with them?\"\\n\\n\"And do you find your hired workmen satisfactory?\"\\n\\n\"Not altogether,\" muttered Nikolai Petrovitch. \"You see, they have\\nbecome spoilt, more\\'s the pity! Any real energy seems quite to have\\nleft them, and they not only ruin my implements, but also leave the\\nland untilled. Does estate-management interest you?\"\\n\\n\"The thing we most lack here is shade,\" remarked Arkady in evasion of\\nthe question.\\n\\n\"Ah, but I have had an awning added to the north balcony, so that we\\ncan take our meals in the open air.\"\\n\\n\"But that will give the place rather the look of a villa, will it not?\\nThings of that sort never prove effectual. But oh, the air here! How\\ngood it smells! Yes, in my opinion, things never smell elsewhere as\\nthey do here. And oh, the sky!\"\\n\\nSuddenly Arkady stopped, threw a glance of apprehension in the\\ndirection of the _tarantass_, and relapsed into silence.\\n\\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied Nikolai Petrovitch. \"You see, the\\nreason is that you were born here, and that therefore the place is\\nbound to have for you a special significance.\"\\n\\n\"But no significance can attach to the place of a man\\'s birth, Papa.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no. None whatsoever.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch glanced at the speaker, and for fully half a verst\\nlet the vehicle proceed without the conversation between them being\\nrenewed. At length Nikolai Petrovitch observed:\\n\\n\"I cannot remember whether I wrote to tell you that your old nurse,\\nEgorovna, is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead? Oh, the poor old woman! But Prokofitch--is _he_ still alive?\"\\n\\n\"He is so, and in no way changed--that is to say, he grumbles as much\\nas ever. In fact, you will find that no _really_ important alterations\\nhave taken place at Marino.\"\\n\\n\"And have you the same steward as before?\"\\n\\n\"No; I have appointed a fresh one, for I came to the conclusion that\\nI could not have any freed serfs about the place. That is to say,\\nI did not feel as though I could trust such fellows with posts of\\nresponsibility.\" Arkady indicated Peter with his eyes, and Nikolai\\nPetrovitch therefore subdued his voice a little. \"He? Oh, _il est\\nlibre, en effet_. You see, he is my valet. But as regards a steward,\\nI have appointed a _miestchanin_,[1] at a salary of 250 roubles a\\nyear, and he seems at least capable. But\"--and here Nikolai Petrovitch\\nrubbed his forehead, which gesture with him always implied inward\\nagitation--\"I ought to say that, though I have told you that you will\\nfind no alterations of importance at Marino, the statement is not\\nstrictly true, seeing that it is my duty to warn you that, that----\"\\nNikolai Petrovitch hesitated again--then added in French: \"Perhaps by a\\nstern moralist my frankness might be considered misplaced; yet I will\\nnot conceal from you, nor can you fail to be aware, that always I have\\nhad ideas of my own on the subject of the relations which ought to\\nsubsist between a father and his son. At the same time, this is not to\\nsay that you have not the right to _judge_ me. Rather, it is that at my\\nage----Well, to put matters bluntly, the girl whom you will have heard\\nme speak of----\"\\n\\n\"You mean Thenichka?\" said Arkady.\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch\\'s face went red.\\n\\n\"Do not speak of her so loudly,\" he advised. \"Yes, _she_ is living with\\nus. I took her in because two of our smaller rooms were available. But\\nof course the arrangement must be changed.\"\\n\\n\"Why must it, Papa?\"\\n\\n\"Because this friend of yours is coming, and also because--well, it\\nmight make things awkward.\"\\n\\n\"Do not disturb yourself on Bazarov\\'s account. He is altogether\\nsuperior to such things.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, so you say; but the mischief lies in the fact that the wing is so\\nsmall.\"\\n\\n\"Papa, Papa!\" protested Arkady. \"Almost one would think that you\\nconsidered yourself to blame for something; whereas you have _nothing_\\nto reproach yourself with.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but I have,\" responded Nikolai Petrovitch. His face had turned\\nredder than ever.\\n\\n\"No, you have _not_, Papa,\" repeated Arkady with a loving smile, while\\nadding to himself with a feeling of indulgent tenderness for his good,\\nkind father, as well as with a certain sense of \"superiority\": \"Why is\\nhe making these excuses?\"\\n\\n\"I beg of you to say no more,\" he continued with an involuntary feeling\\nof exultation in being \"grown up\" and \"emancipated.\" As he did so\\nNikolai Petrovitch glanced at him from under the fingers of the hand\\nwhich was still rubbing his brows. At the same moment something seemed\\nto give his heart a stab. Mentally, as before, he blamed himself.\\n\\n\"Here our fields begin,\" he observed after a pause.\\n\\n\"I see,\" rejoined Arkady. \"And that is our forest in front, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"It is so. Only, only--I have sold it, and this year it is to be\\nremoved.\"\\n\\n\"Why have you sold it?\"\\n\\n\"Because I needed the money. Moreover, the land which it occupies must\\ngo to the peasants.\"\\n\\n\"What? To the peasants who pay you no tithes?\"\\n\\n\"Possibly. But some day they will pay me.\"\\n\\n\"I regret the forest\\'s loss,\" said Arkady, and then resumed his\\ncontemplation of the landscape.\\n\\nThe scenery which the party were traversing could not have been called\\npicturesque, for, with slight undulations, only fields, fields, and\\nagain fields, stretched to the very horizon. True, a few patches of\\ncopse were visible, but the ditches, with their borderings of low,\\nsparse brushwood, recalled the antique land-measurement of Katherine\\'s\\nday. Also, streams ran pent between abruptly sloping banks, hamlets\\nwith dwarfed huts (of which the blackened roofs were, for the most\\npart, cracked in half) stood cheek by jowl with crazy grinding-byres\\nof plaited willow, empty threshing-floors had their gates sagging,\\nand from churches of wood or of brick which stood amid dilapidated\\ngraveyards the stucco was peeling, and the crosses were threatening at\\nany moment to fall. As he gazed at the scene Arkady\\'s heart contracted.\\nMoreover, the peasants encountered on the road looked ragged, and were\\nriding sorry nags, while the laburnum trees which stood ranged like\\nmiserable beggars by the roadside had their bark hanging in strips,\\nand their boughs shattered. Lastly, the lean, mud-encrusted cows which\\ncould be seen hungrily cropping the herbage in the ditches were so\\n\"staring\" of coat that the animals might just have been rescued from\\nthe talons of some terrible, death-dealing monster; and as one gazed at\\nthose weak, pitiful beasts, almost one could fancy that one saw uprisen\\nfrom amid the beauty of spring, the pale phantoms of Winter--its storms\\nand its frost and its snow.\\n\\n\"Evidently this is not a rich district,\" reflected Arkady. \"Rather,\\nit is a district which gives one the impression neither of abundance\\nnor of hard work. Yet can it be left as it is? No! Education is what\\nwe need. But how is that education to be administered, or, for that\\nmatter, to be introduced?\"\\n\\nThus Arkady. Yet, even as the thought passed through his mind, Spring\\nseemed once more to regain possession of her kingdom, and everything\\naround him grew golden-green, and trees, shrubs, and herbage started\\nto wave and glimmer under the soft, warm breath of the vernal zephyrs,\\nand larks took to pouring out their souls in endless, ringing strains,\\nand siskins, circling high over sunken ponds, uttered their cry, then\\nskimmed the hillocks in silence, and handsome black rooks stalked\\namong the tender green of the short corn-shoots, or settled among the\\npale-white, smokelike ripples of the young rye, whence at intervals\\nthey protruded their heads.\\n\\nArkady gazed and gazed; and gradually, as he did so, his late thoughts\\ngrew dimmer and disappeared, and, throwing off his travelling-cloak,\\nhe peered so joyously, with such a boyish air, into his father\\'s face\\nthat Nikolai Petrovitch bestowed upon him yet another embrace.\\n\\n\"We have but little further to go now,\" he remarked. \"In fact, when\\nonce we have topped that rise the house will come into view. And what\\na time we are going to have together, Arkasha! For you will be able\\nto help me with the estate (if you care to, that is to say?), and you\\nand I will draw nearer to one another, and make one another\\'s better\\nacquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"We will!\" cried Arkady. \"And what splendid weather for us both!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; specially for your home-coming is spring in all its glory. Yet I\\nam not sure that I do not agree with Pushkin where he says, in _Eugène\\nOnegin_:\\n\\n/$\\n    \"How sad to me is your coming,\\n     O spring, spring, season of love!\"\\n$/\\n\\n\"Arkady,\" shouted Bazarov from the _tarantass_, \"please send me a match\\nor two, for I have nothing to light my pipe with.\"\\n\\nInstantly Nikolai Petrovitch ceased quoting poetry, and Arkady (who\\nhad listened with considerable surprise, though also with a certain\\nmeasure of sympathy, to his father) hastened to produce from his pocket\\na silver matchbox, and to dispatch the same by the hand of Peter.\\n\\n\"In return, would you care to have a cigar?\" called Bazarov.\\n\\n\"I should,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\nThe result was that when Peter returned to the _koliaska_ he handed\\nArkady not only the matchbox, but also a fat black cigar. This Arkady\\nlit at leisure, and then proceeded to diffuse around him so strong and\\nacrid an odour of tobacco that Nikolai Petrovitch (a non-smoker from\\nbirth) found himself forced to avert his nose (though he did this\\ncovertly, for fear of offending his son).\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later the vehicles drew up at the steps of a new\\nwooden mansion, painted grey, and roofed with red sheet-iron. The\\nmansion was Marino, or Novaia Sloboda, or, to quote the peasants\\' name,\\n\"Bobili Chutor.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] A member of the trading or shopkeeping class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nThere issued on to the verandah to greet the arrivals no throng of\\nhousehold serfs--only a solitary girl of twelve. Presently, however,\\nshe was joined by a young fellow much resembling Peter, but dressed\\nin a grey livery coat to which embossed, silver-gilt buttons were\\nattached. This was Paul Kirsanov\\'s valet. In silence he opened the door\\nof the _koliaska_, and unhooked the apron of the _tarantass_; whereupon\\nthe three gentlemen alighted, passed through a dark, bare hall (the\\nface of a young woman peered at them for a moment from behind a door),\\nand entered a drawing-room upholstered in the latest fashion.\\n\\n\"So here we are at home again!\" exclaimed Nikolai Petrovitch, taking\\noff his cap, and shaking back his hair. \"Let us have supper, and then\\nfor bed, bed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, something to eat would undoubtedly be welcome,\" remarked Bazarov\\nas, yawning, he seated himself upon a sofa.\\n\\n\"Quite so; I will have supper served at once.\" Nikolai Petrovitch,\\nfor no apparent reason, tripped over his own feet. \"And here comes\\nProkofitch,\" he added.\\n\\nAs he spoke entered a man of about sixty who, white-haired, and of\\nthin, swarthy features, was wearing a cinnamon-coloured tail-coat\\nwith brass buttons and a crimson collar. He smiled with delight as he\\napproached and shook hands with Arkady. Then, with a bow to the guest,\\nhe retired to the doorway, and folded his hands behind his back.\\n\\n\"So here is the young master, Prokofitch!\" said Nikolai Petrovitch.\\n\"He is home at last. And how, think you, is he looking?\"\\n\\n\"Very well, very well,\" the old man said with another smile. The next\\nmoment, however, he knit his shaggy brows, and suggested: \"Shall I lay\\nthe table?\"\\n\\n\"If you please, if you please.\" Nikolai Petrovitch turned to Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Before supper,\" he said, \"would you care to go to your room?\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, no. But please have my trunk conveyed thither, and also\\nthis wrap.\" And Bazarov divested himself of his cloak.\\n\\n\"Certainly. Prokofitch, take the gentleman\\'s cloak.\"\\n\\nThe old butler received the garment gingerly, held it well away from\\nhim with both hands, and left the room on tiptoe.\\n\\n\"And you, Arkady?\" continued Nikolai Petrovitch. \"Do you not wish to go\\nto your room?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; for a wash I should be thankful,\" was Arkady\\'s reply as he moved\\ntowards the door. At that moment it opened to admit a man of medium\\nheight who was dressed in a dark English suit, a fashionably low\\ncollar, and a pair of patent leather boots. This was Paul Petrovitch\\nKirsanov. Although forty-five, he had close-cropped grey hair of the\\nsheen of new silver, and his sallow, unwrinkled face was as clear-cut\\nand regular of outline as though carved with a light, fine chisel.\\nStill retaining traces of remarkable comeliness, his bright, black,\\noblong eyes had a peculiar attraction, and his every well-bred, refined\\nfeature showed that symmetry of youth, that air of superiority to the\\nrest of the world which usually disappears when once the twenties have\\nbeen passed.\\n\\nDrawing from his trouser pocket a slender hand the long, pink nails\\nof which looked all the slenderer for the snowy whiteness of the\\nsuperimposed cuff and large opal sleeve-link, he offered it to his\\nnephew; after which, this prefatory European \"handshake\" over, he\\nthrice kissed Arkady in the Russian fashion--that is to say, touched\\nhis nephew\\'s cheek with his perfumed moustache, and murmured: \"I\\ncongratulate you.\"\\n\\nNext Nikolai Petrovitch presented to him Bazarov. Inclining his supple\\nfigure with a faint smile, Paul Petrovitch this time did not offer his\\nhand. On the contrary, he replaced it in his pocket.\\n\\n\"I was beginning to think that you never meant to arrive,\" he said with\\nan amiable hoist of his shoulders and a display of some beautiful white\\nteeth. \"What happened to you?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" replied Arkady, \"except that we lingered a little. For the\\nsame reason are we as hungry as wolves; so pray tell Prokofitch to be\\nquick, Papa, and I shall be back in a moment.\"\\n\\n\"Wait; I will go with you,\" added Bazarov as he rose from the sofa; and\\nthe two young men left the room together.\\n\\n\"Who is your guest?\" asked Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"A friend of Arkady\\'s, and, according to Arkady\\'s showing, a man of\\nintellect.\"\\n\\n\"He is going to stay here?\"\\n\\n\"He is.\"\\n\\n\"A long-haired fellow like that?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\nIn that particular direction Paul Petrovitch said no more, but, tapping\\nthe table with his finger-nails, added:\\n\\n\"_Je pense que notre Arkady s\\'est dégourdi._[1] And in any case I am\\npleased to see him back again.\"\\n\\nAt supper little was said. In particular did Bazarov scarcely speak,\\nthough he ate heartily; and only Nikolai Petrovitch proved garrulous as\\nhe related various incidents in what he termed his \"agricultural life,\"\\nand gossiped of forthcoming administrative measures, committees,\\ndeputations, the need of introducing machinery, and other such topics.\\n\\nFor his part, Paul Petrovitch paced the room (he never took supper),\\nand sipped a glassful of red wine, and occasionally interjected some\\nsuch remark--rather, exclamation--as \"Ah!\" or \"Oh, ho!\" or \"H\\'m!\"\\nArkady\\'s contribution consisted of a little St. Petersburg gossip, even\\nthough, throughout, he was conscious of a touch of that awkwardness\\nwhich overtakes a young man when, just ceased to be a boy, he returns\\nto the spot where hitherto he has ranked as a mere child. In other\\nwords, he drawled his phrases unnecessarily, carefully avoided the use\\nof the term \"Papasha,\"[2] and, once, even went so far as to substitute\\nfor it the term \"Otety\"[3]--though, true, he pronounced it with some\\ndifficulty. Lastly, in his excessive desire to seem at his ease, he\\nhelped himself to more wine than was good for him, and tasted some of\\nevery brand. Meanwhile Prokofitch chewed his lips, and never removed\\nhis eyes from his young master.\\n\\nSupper over, the company dispersed.\\n\\n\"A queer fellow is that uncle of yours,\" Bazarov said to Arkady as,\\nclad in a dressing-gown, he seated himself by his friend\\'s bed, and\\nsucked at a short pipe. \"To think of encountering such elegance in the\\ncountry! He would take a prize with his finger-nails.\"\\n\\n\"You do not know him yet,\" said Arkady. \"In his day he was a leading\\nlion, and some time or another I will tell you his history. Yes, many\\nand many a woman has lost her head over his good looks.\"\\n\\n\"Then I should think that he has nothing to live on save memories,\"\\nobserved Bazarov. \"At all events, there is no one _here_ for him to\\nenslave. I looked him over to-night, and never in my life have beheld\\na collar of such marvellous gloss, or a chin so perfectly shaven. Yet\\nsuch things can come to look ridiculous, do not you think?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--perhaps they can. But he is such an excellent fellow in himself!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly--a truly archangelic personage! Your father, too, is\\nexcellent; for though he may read foolish poetry, and though his ideas\\non the subject of industry may be few, his heart is in the right place.\"\\n\\n\"He is a man with a heart of gold.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, did you notice his nervousness to-night?\"\\n\\nArkady nodded as though to himself such a weakness was a perfect\\nstranger.\\n\\n\"Curious indeed!\" commented Bazarov. \"Ah, you elderly Romanticists!\\nYou over-develop the nervous system until the balance is upset. Now,\\ngood-night. In my room there is an English washstand, yet the door\\nwill not shut! But such things (English washstands I mean) need to be\\nencouraged: they represent \\'progress.\\'\"\\n\\nAnd Bazarov departed, while Arkady surrendered himself to a sensation\\nof comfort. How pleasant was it to be sinking to sleep in one\\'s\\ncomfortable home, and in one\\'s own familiar bed, and under a well-known\\ncoverlet worked by loving hands--perhaps those of his good, kind,\\ntireless old nurse! And at the thought of Egorovna he sighed, and\\ncommended her soul to the Heavenly Powers. But for himself he did not\\npray.\\n\\nSoon both he and Bazarov were asleep; but certain other members of the\\nhousehold there were who remained wakeful. In particular had Nikolai\\nPetrovitch been greatly excited by his son\\'s return; and though he went\\nto bed, he left the candle burning, and, resting with his head on his\\nhands, lay thinking deeply.\\n\\nAlso, his brother sat up in his study until nearly midnight. Seated\\nin an ample armchair before a corner where a marble stove was\\nsmouldering, he had effected no alteration in his costume beyond\\nhaving exchanged his patent leather boots for a pair of heelless, red\\nfelt slippers. Lastly, he was holding, though not reading, the latest\\nnumber of _Galignani_, and his eyes were fixed upon the stove, where\\na quivering blue spurt of flame kept alternately disappearing and\\nbursting forth again. Whither his thoughts were wandering God only\\nknows; but that they were not meandering through the past alone was\\nproved by the fact that in his expression there was a concentrated\\ngloom which is never in evidence when a man\\'s mind is occupied with\\nmemories and no more.\\n\\nFinally, seated on a chest in a small room at the back of the house,\\nand wearing a blue dressing-jacket and, thrown over her dark hair,\\na white scarf, was the girl Thenichka. As she sat there she kept\\nlistening, and starting, and gazing towards an open door which at once\\nafforded a glimpse of an infant\\'s cot and admitted the sound of a\\nsleeping child\\'s respiration.\\n\\n\\n[1] \"I think that our friend Arkady has acquired some polish.\"\\n\\n[2] Dear Papa.\\n\\n[3] Father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nNext morning Bazarov was the first to awake and go out of doors.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" thought he to himself as he gazed about him, \"this is _not_ much\\nof a place to look at.\"\\n\\nWhen apportioning allotments to his peasantry, Nikolai Petrovitch had\\nfound himself forced to exclude from the new \"farm\" four _desiatins_\\nof level, naked land, and upon this space had built himself a house,\\nquarters for his servants, and a homestead. Also, he had laid out\\na garden, dug a pond, and sunk two wells. But the young trees had\\nfared badly, very little water had risen in the pond, and the wells\\nhad developed a brackish taste. The only vegetation to attain robust\\ngrowth was a clump of lilacs and acacias, under the shade of which the\\nhousehold was accustomed to take tea or to dine. Within a few minutes\\nBazarov had traversed all the paths in the garden, visited the stables\\nand the cattlesheds, and made friends with two young household serfs\\nwhom he happened to encounter, and with whom he set forth to catch\\nfrogs in a marsh about a verst from the manor.\\n\\n\"For what do you want frogs, _barin_?\" asked one of the lads.\\n\\n\"To make them useful,\" replied Bazarov (who possessed a peculiar gift\\nfor winning the confidence of his inferiors, even though he never\\ncozened them, but, on the contrary, always treated them with asperity).\\n\"You see, I like to open them, and then to observe what their insides\\nare doing. You and I are frogs too, except that we walk upon our hind\\nlegs. Thus the operation helps me to understand what is taking place in\\nourselves.\"\\n\\n\"And what good will that do you?\"\\n\\n\"This. That if you should fall sick, and I should have to treat you, I\\nmight avoid some mistakes.\"\\n\\n\"Then you are a doctor?\"\\n\\n\"I am.\"\\n\\n\"Listen to that, Vasika! The _barin_ says that you and I too are frogs.\\nMy word!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like frogs,\" remarked Vasika, a barefooted boy of seven with\\na head as white as tow, and a costume made up of a grey blouse and a\\nstiff collar.\\n\\n\"_Why_ don\\'t you like them?\" asked Bazarov. \"Do you think they will\\nbite you? Nay! Into the water, my young philosophers!\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch too had left his bed, and, on going to visit Arkady,\\nfound him fully dressed; wherefore father and son proceeded to repair\\nto the terrace, and there seated themselves under the shade of the\\nawning. Amid nosegays of lilac, a tea-urn was simmering on a table\\nby the balustrade, and presently there appeared upon the scene also\\nthe damsel who, on the previous night, had met the arrivals on the\\nverandah. She announced in shrill tones:\\n\\n\"Theodosia Nikolaevna is not very well this morning, and cannot come to\\nbreakfast. So she has told me to ask you whether you will pour out tea\\nfor yourselves, or whether she is to send Duniasha?\"\\n\\n\"I will pour it out myself,\" Nikolai Petrovitch replied with some\\nhaste. \"Will you have cream or lemon in your tea, Arkady?\"\\n\\n\"Cream,\" he replied. After a pause he continued:\\n\\n\"Papasha----\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch glanced confusedly in his direction.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said he.\\n\\nArkady lowered his eyes.\\n\\n\"Pardon me if my question should seem to you indiscreet,\" he began,\\n\"but, owing to your frankness of last night, I am emboldened to return\\nit. You will not take offence, will you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no! Pray go on.\"\\n\\n\"Then I feel encouraged to ask you whether it--whether it is because\\nI am here that she--that is to say, Thenichka--has not joined us at\\nbreakfast?\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch slightly averted his face.\\n\\n\"It may be so,\" he said at length. \"At all events, I presume that--that\\nshe prefers, she prefers--in fact, that she is shy.\"\\n\\nArkady glanced at his father.\\n\\n\"But why should she be shy?\" he inquired. \"In the first place, you know\\nmy views\" (he uttered the words with no little complacency), \"and, in\\nthe second place, surely you cannot suppose that I would by a hair\\'s\\nbreadth intrude upon your life and your habits? No; sure am I that\\nnever could you make a bad choice; and if you have asked this girl\\nto reside under your roof, that is tantamount to saying that she has\\nwell deserved it. In any case, moreover, it is not for a son to summon\\nhis father to judgment--least of all for me, who possess a father\\nlike yourself, a father who has never restricted his son\\'s freedom of\\naction.\"\\n\\nAt first Arkady\\'s voice had trembled a little, since not only did he\\nfeel that he was doing the \"magnanimous,\" but also he knew that he\\nwas delivering something like a \"lecture\" to his father; but such an\\neffect does the sound of his own voice exercise upon a human being that\\ntowards the end Arkady pronounced his words firmly, and even with a\\ncertain degree of _empressement_.\\n\\n\"I thank you, Arkady,\" Nikolai Petrovitch said faintly as his fingers\\nbegan their customary perambulation of his forehead. \"Nor is your\\nconjecture mistaken, for if this girl had not deserved the invitation,\\nI should not, of course, have--in other words, as you imply, this is no\\nfrivolous whim on my part. Nor need I have spoken of the matter, were\\nit not that I desired you to understand that she might possibly have\\nfelt embarrassed at meeting you on the very day after your arrival.\"\\n\\n\"Then let _me_ go and meet _her_,\" exclaimed Arkady with another access\\nof \"magnanimity\" as he sprang from his chair. \"Yes, let _me_ go and\\nexplain to her why she need not shun me.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch also rose.\\n\\n\"Arkady,\" he began, \"pray do me a favour. Hitherto I had not warned you\\nthat----\"\\n\\nBut, without listening to him, Arkady darted from the terrace. For\\na moment or two Nikolai Petrovitch gazed after him--then, overcome\\nwith confusion, relapsed into a chair. His heart was beating rapidly.\\nWhether or not he was picturing to himself a strangeness of future\\nrelations with his son; whether he was imagining that, had his son\\nrefrained from interfering, the latter might have paid him more respect\\nin future; whether he was reproaching himself for his own weakness--it\\nis difficult to say what his thoughts were. Probably in them there was\\na combination of the feelings just indicated, if only in the form of\\napprehensions. Yet those apprehensions cannot have been deeply rooted,\\nas was proved by the fact that, for all the beating of his heart, the\\ncolour had not left his face.\\n\\nSoon hasty footsteps were heard approaching, and Arkady reappeared on\\nthe terrace.\\n\\n\"I have made her acquaintance!\" he shouted with a kindly,\\ngood-humoured, triumphant expression. \"That Theodosia Nikolaievna is\\nnot well to-day is a fact; but also it is a fact that she is going to\\nappear later. And why did you not tell me that I had a little brother?\\nOtherwise I should have gone and kissed him last night, even as I have\\ndone this moment.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch tried to say something--to rise and to make an\\nexplanation of some sort; but Arkady cut him short by falling upon his\\nneck.\\n\\n\"What is this? Again embracing?\" said Paul Petrovitch behind them.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, neither father nor son was ill-pleased to see\\nhim appear, for, however touching such situations may be, one may be\\nequally glad to escape from them.\\n\\n\"At what are you surprised?\" asked Nikolai Petrovitch gaily. \"Remember\\nthat I have not seen Arkesha for several centuries--at all events, not\\nsince last night!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I am not surprised,\" said Paul Petrovitch. \"On the contrary, I\\nshould not mind embracing him myself.\"\\n\\nAnd Arkady, on approaching his uncle, felt once more upon his cheek the\\nimpression of a perfumed moustache. Paul Petrovitch then sat down to\\ntable. Clad in an elegant morning suit of English cut, he was flaunting\\non his head a diminutive fez which helped the carelessly folded tie to\\nsymbolise the freedom of a country life. At the same time, the stiff\\ncollar of the shirt (which was striped, not white, as best befitted\\na matutinal toilet) supported with its usual rigour an immaculately\\nshaven chin.\\n\\n\"Well, Arkady?\" said he. \"Where is your new friend?\"\\n\\n\"Out somewhere. He seldom misses going for an early morning walk.\\nBut the great thing is to take no notice of him, for he detests all\\nceremony.\"\\n\\n\"So I have perceived.\" And with his usual deliberateness Paul\\nPetrovitch began to butter a piece of bread. \"Will he be staying here\\nvery long?\"\\n\\n\"Well, as long as he may care to stay. As a matter of fact, he is going\\non to his father\\'s place.\"\\n\\n\"And where does his father live?\"\\n\\n\"Some eighty versts from here, in the same province as ourselves. I\\nbelieve he has a small property, and used to be an army doctor.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! Ever since last night I have been asking myself where I can have\\nheard the name before. Nikolai, do you remember whether there was a\\ndoctor of that name in our father\\'s division?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there used to be.\"\\n\\n\"Then that doctor will be this fellow\\'s father. H\\'m!\" And Paul\\nPetrovitch twitched his moustache. \"What exactly is your Bazarov?\" he\\nenquired of Arkady.\\n\\n\"What _is_ he?\" Arkady repeated smiling. \"Do you really want me to tell\\nyou what he is, Uncle?\"\\n\\n\"If you please, my nephew.\"\\n\\n\"He is a Nihilist.\"\\n\\n\"A what?\" exclaimed Nikolai Petrovitch, while even Paul Petrovitch\\npaused in the act of raising a knife to the edge of which there was a\\nmorsel of butter adhering.\\n\\n\"A Nihilist,\" repeated Arkady.\\n\\n\"A Nihilist?\" queried Nikolai Petrovitch. \"I imagine that that must\\nbe a term derived from the Latin _nihil_ or \\'nothing.\\' It denotes,\\nI presume, a man who--a man who--well, a man who declines to accept\\n_anything_.\"\\n\\n\"Or a man who declines to _respect_ anything,\" hazarded Paul Petrovitch\\nas he re-applied himself to the butter.\\n\\n\"No, a man who treats things solely from the critical point of view,\"\\ncorrected Arkady.\\n\\n\"But the two things are one and the same, are they not?\" queried Paul\\nPetrovitch.\\n\\n\"Oh no. A Nihilist is a man who declines to bow to authority, or to\\naccept any principle on trust, however sanctified it may be.\"\\n\\n\"And to what can that lead?\" asked Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"It depends upon the individual. In one man\\'s case, it may lead to\\ngood; in that of another, to evil.\"\\n\\n\"I see. But we elders view things differently. We folk of the\\nolder generation believe that without principles\" (Paul Petrovitch\\npronounced the word softly, and with a French accent, whereas Arkady\\nhad pronounced it with an emphasis on the leading syllable)--\"without\\nprinciples it is impossible to take a single step in life, or to draw a\\nsingle breath. _Mais vous avez changé tout cela._ God send you health\\nand a general\\'s rank, Messieurs Nihil--how do you pronounce it?\"\\n\\n\"Ni-hi-lists,\" said Arkady distinctly.\\n\\n\"Quite so (formerly we had Hegelists, and now they have become\\nNihilists)--God send you health and a general\\'s rank, but also let us\\nsee how you will contrive to exist in an absolute void, an airless\\nvacuum. Pray ring the bell, brother Nikolai, for it is time for me to\\ntake my cocoa.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch did as requested, and also shouted for Duniasha;\\nbut, instead of the latter, there issued on to the terrace Thenichka\\nin person. A young woman of twenty-three, she was pale, and\\ngentle-looking, with dark eyes and hair, a pair of childishly red,\\npouting lips, and delicate hands. Also, she was clad in a clean\\ncotton gown, a new blue kerchief was thrown lightly over her rounded\\nshoulders, and she was carrying in front of her a large cup of cocoa.\\nShyly she placed the latter before Paul Petrovitch, while a warm, rosy\\ncurrent of blood suffused the exquisite skin of her comely face, and\\nthen she remained standing by the table, with lowered eyes and the\\ntips of her fingers touching its surface. Yet, though she looked as\\nthough she were regretting having come, she looked as though she felt\\nthat she had a right to be there.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch frowned, and Nikolai Petrovitch looked confused.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Thenichka,\" the latter muttered.\\n\\n\"Good morning,\" she replied in a low, clear voice. Then she glanced\\naskance at Arkady, and he smiled at her in friendly fashion. Finally\\nshe departed with a quiet step and slightly careless gait--the latter a\\npeculiarity of hers.\\n\\nSilence reigned on the terrace. For a while Paul Petrovitch drank his\\ncocoa. Then he suddenly raised his head, and muttered:\\n\\n\"Monsieur Nihilist is about to give us the pleasure of his company.\"\\n\\nTrue enough, Bazarov could be seen stepping across the flowerbeds. On\\nhis linen jacket and trousers was a thick coating of mud, to the crown\\nof his ancient circular hat clung a piece of sticky marshweed, and in\\nhis hand he was holding a small bag. Also, something in the bag kept\\nstirring as though it were alive. Approaching the terrace with rapid\\nstrides, he nodded to the company and said:\\n\\n\"Good morning, gentlemen! Pardon me for being so late. I shall be back\\npresently, but first my captures must be stowed away.\"\\n\\n\"What are those captures?\" Paul Petrovitch inquired. \"Leeches?\"\\n\\n\"No, frogs.\"\\n\\n\"Do you eat them? Or do you breed them?\"\\n\\n\"I catch them for purposes of experiment,\" was Bazarov\\'s only reply as\\ncarelessly he entered the house.\\n\\n\"In other words, he vivisects them,\" was Paul Petrovitch\\'s comment. \"In\\nother words, he believes in frogs more than in principles.\"\\n\\nArkady threw his uncle a reproachful look, and even Nikolai Petrovitch\\nshrugged his shoulders, so that Paul Petrovitch himself felt his _bon\\nmot_ to have been out of place, and hastened to divert the subject to\\nthe estate and the new steward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nBazarov, returning, seated himself at the table, and fell to drinking\\ntea. The brothers contemplated him in silence. Arkady glanced covertly\\nfrom his father to his uncle, and back again.\\n\\n\"Have you walked far this morning?\" at length Nikolai Petrovitch\\ninquired.\\n\\n\"To a marsh beside an aspen coppice. By the way, Arkady, I flushed five\\nhead of woodcock. Perhaps you would like to go and shoot them?\"\\n\\n\"Then you yourself are no sportsman?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, you prefer physics to anything else?\" This from Paul\\nPetrovitch.\\n\\n\"Yes, I prefer physics--in fact, the natural sciences in general--to\\nanything else.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am told that the _Germanics_ have made great strides in that\\ndepartment?\" (Paul Petrovitch used the term \"Germanics\" instead of\\n\"Germans\" ironically, but no one noticed it.)\\n\\n\"True,\" was Bazarov\\'s careless reply. \"In fact, the Germans are, in the\\nsame respect, our masters.\"\\n\\n\"You think highly of the Germans?\" Paul Petrovitch\\'s tone was now\\nstudiously polite, for he was beginning to feel irritated with the\\nman--his aristocratic nature could not altogether stomach Bazarov\\'s\\nabsolute lack of ceremony, the fact that this doctor\\'s son not only\\nknew no diffidence, but actually returned snappish and reluctant\\nanswers, and infused a _brusquerie_ akin to rudeness into his tone.\\n\\n\"At least the savants of that part of the world have some energy in\\nthem,\" retorted Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Quite so. And your opinion of our Russian savants is--well, perhaps\\nless flattering?\"\\n\\n\"It is, with your leave.\"\\n\\n\"That constitutes a piece of laudable modesty on your part,\" Paul\\nPetrovitch observed with a slight hitch of his figure and a toss of his\\nhead. \"But how comes it about that Arkady has just told us that you\\nrecognise no authorities whatsoever? Do you not trust authorities?\"\\n\\n\"Why should I? Is anything in the world trustworthy? Certainly, should\\nI be told a fact, I agree with it, but that is all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Then the Germans confine themselves solely to facts?\" Paul\\nPetrovitch\\'s face had now assumed an expression of detachment, as\\nthough he had suddenly become withdrawn to the ultimate heights of the\\nempyrean.\\n\\n\"No, not all Germans,\" replied Bazarov with a passing yawn. Clearly\\nhe had no mind to continue the controversy. Meanwhile Paul Petrovitch\\nglanced at Arkady as much as to say: \"Admit that your friend has\\nbeautiful manners!\"\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" he continued, ostentatiously, and with an effort,\\n\"I, a fallible mortal, do _not_ favour the Germans. Of course, I am not\\nincluding in that category the _Russo_-Germans, who, as we know, are\\nbirds of passage. Rather, it is the Germans of Germany proper whom I\\ncannot abide. Once upon a time they used to produce men like Schiller\\nand like--what\\'s his name?--Goethe: for both of which authors my\\nbrother has a marked predilection. But now the German nation has become\\na nation solely of chemists and materialists.\"\\n\\n\"A good chemist is worth a score of your poets,\" remarked Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Quite so.\" Paul Petrovitch hitched his eyebrows a little, as though he\\nhad come near to falling asleep. \"Er--I take it then that you decline\\nto recognise art, but believe only in science?\"\\n\\n\"I have told you that I believe in nothing at all. What after all, is\\nscience--that is to say, science in the mass? A science may exist, even\\nas a trade or a profession may exist; but with regard to science in the\\nmass, there is no such thing.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. And, with regard to such other postulates as usually are\\ngranted in human affairs, the attitude which you adopt is negative in\\nthe same degree?\"\\n\\n\"What is this?\" suddenly countered Bazarov. \"Is it an examination in\\ntenets?\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch turned pale, and Nikolai Petrovitch thought it time to\\nintervene in the dispute.\\n\\n\"Nay, we will debate the subject later,\" he said. \"And then, while\\nrecognising your views, good Evgenii Vasilitch, we will state our own.\\nIndividually speaking, I am delighted that you should be interested in\\nthe natural sciences. For instance, I am told that recently Liebig[1]\\nhas made some surprising discoveries in the matter of the improvement\\nof soils. Consequently you might be able to help me in my agricultural\\nlabours, and to give me much useful advice.\"\\n\\n\"Always I shall be at your service, Nikolai Petrovitch,\" replied\\nBazarov. \"But what has Liebig to do with us? First the alphabet should\\nbe learnt before we try to read books. We have not even reached the\\nletter A.\"\\n\\n\"You are a Nihilist--that is plain enough,\" reflected Nikolai\\nPetrovitch; while aloud he added: \"Yet allow me to seek your occasional\\nassistance. Brother Paul, I believe it is time that we interviewed our\\nsteward.\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch rose from his chair.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, without looking at any one in particular, \"it is indeed\\na terrible thing to have lived five years in the country, and to have\\nstood remote from superior intellects! If one is _ab origine_ a fool,\\none becomes so more than ever, seeing that, however much one may try\\nnot to forget what one has learnt, there will dawn upon one, sooner\\nor later, the revelation that one\\'s knowledge is all rubbish, that\\nsensible men have ceased to engage in such futilities, and that one has\\nlagged far behind the times. But, in such a case, what is one to do?\\nEvidently the younger generation know more than we do.\"\\n\\nAnd, slowly turning on his heel, he moved away as slowly, with Nikolai\\nPetrovitch following in his wake.\\n\\n\"Does Paul Petrovitch always reside here?\" asked Bazarov when the door\\nhad closed upon the pair.\\n\\n\"Yes, he does. But look here, Evgenii. You adopted too sharp a tone\\nwith my uncle. You have offended him.\"\\n\\n\"What? Am I to fawn upon these rustic aristocrats, even though their\\nattitude is one purely of conceit and subservience to custom? If such\\nbe Paul Petrovitch\\'s bent, he had better have continued his career in\\nSt. Petersburg. Never mind him, however. Do you know, I have found a\\nsplendid specimen of the water beetle _dytiscus marginatus_. Are you\\nacquainted with it? I will show it you.\"\\n\\n\"Did I not promise to tell you his history?\" observed Arkady musingly.\\n\\n\"Whose history? The water beetle\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"No; my uncle\\'s. At least you will see from it that he is not the man\\nyou take him for, but a man who deserves pity rather than ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"I am not prepared to dispute it. But how come you to be so devoted to\\nhim?\"\\n\\n\"Always one ought to be fair.\"\\n\\n\"The connection I do not see.\"\\n\\n\"Then listen.\"\\n\\nAnd Arkady related the story to be found in the following chapter.\\n\\n\\n[1] Justus Freiherr von Liebig (1803-1873), the great German\\nchemist--in particular, the founder of agricultural chemistry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\n\"Like his brother, Paul Petrovitch Kirsanov received his early\\neducation at home, and entered the Imperial Corps of Pages.\\nDistinguished from boyhood for his good looks, he had, in addition,\\na nature of the self-confident, quizzical, amusingly sarcastic type\\nwhich never fails to please. As soon, therefore, as he had received\\nhis officer\\'s commission, he began to go everywhere in society, to\\nset the pace, to amuse himself, to play the rake, and to squander his\\nmoney. Yet these things somehow consorted well with his personality,\\nand women went nearly mad over him, while men called him \\'Fate,\\' and\\nsecretly detested him. Meanwhile he rented a flat with his brother, for\\nwhom, in spite of their dissimilarity, he had a genuine affection. The\\ndissimilarity in question lay, among other things, in the fact that,\\nwhile Nikolai Petrovitch halted, had small, kindly, rather melancholy\\nfeatures and narrow black eyes, and was of a disposition prone to\\nreading omnivorously, to bestirring himself but little, and to feeling\\nnervous when attending social functions, Paul Petrovitch never spent a\\nsingle evening at home, but was renowned for his physical dexterity and\\ndaring (he it was who made gymnastics the rage among the gilded youth\\nof his day), and read, at most, five or six French novels. Indeed, by\\nthe time that he reached his twenty-eighth year Paul had risen to be\\na captain, and before him there seemed to lie a brilliant career; but\\neverything suddenly underwent a change, as shall be related forthwith.\\n\\n\"Among the society of St. Petersburg of that period there was\\naccustomed to appear, and to disappear, at irregular intervals a\\ncertain Princess R. whose memory survives to this day. Though wedded to\\na highly placed and very presentable (albeit slightly stupid) husband,\\nshe had no children, and spent her time between making unexpected\\nvisits abroad and unexpected returns to Russia. In short, she led a\\nvery curious life, and the world in general accounted her a coquette,\\nin that she devoted herself to every sort of pleasure, and danced at\\nballs until she could dance no more, and laughed and jested with young\\nmen whom she received before dinner in the half-light of a darkened\\ndrawing-room. Yet, strangely enough, as the night advanced she would\\nfall to weeping and praying and wringing her hands, and, unable to\\nrest, would pace her room until break of day, or sit huddled, pale and\\ncold, over the Psalter. But no sooner would daylight have appeared than\\nshe would once more become a woman of the world, and drive, and laugh,\\nand chatter, and fling herself upon anything which seemed to offer\\nany sort of distraction. Also, her power to charm was extraordinary;\\nfor though no one could have called her a beauty (seeing that the one\\ngood feature of her face lay in her eyes--and even then it was not the\\nsmall, grey eyes themselves which attracted, but the glance which they\\nemitted), she had hair of the colour and weight of gold which reached\\nto her knees. That glance!--it was a glance which could be careless to\\nthe point of daring or meditative to the point of melancholy; a glance\\nso enigmatical that, even when her tongue was lisping fatuous nonsense,\\nthere gleamed in her aspect something intangible and out of the common.\\nFinally, she dressed with exquisite taste.\\n\\n\"This woman Paul Petrovitch met at a ball; and at it he danced a\\nmazurka with her. Yet, though, during the dance, she uttered not a\\nsingle word of sense, he straightway fell in love with her, and, being\\na man accustomed to conquests, attained his end in this case also.\\nYet, strangely enough, the facility of his triumph in no way chilled\\nhim, but led him on to become more and more resolutely, more and more\\npainfully, attached, and that though she was a woman in whom, even\\nafter she had made the great surrender, there still remained something\\nas immutably veiled, as radically intangible, as before--something\\nwhich no one had yet succeeded in penetrating. What was in that soul\\nGod alone knows. Almost would it seem as though she were subservient\\nto a mysterious force of which the existence was absolutely unknown\\nto her, but which sported with her as it willed, and whose whims\\nher mentality was powerless to control. At all events, her conduct\\nconstituted a series of inconsistencies, and even the few letters which\\nshe wrote to Paul Petrovitch--missives which would undoubtedly have\\naroused her husband\\'s suspicions had he seen them--were written to a\\nman who was practically a stranger to her. And in time her love began\\nto be succeeded by fits of despondency; she ceased to smile and jest\\nwith the lover whom she had selected, and looked at him, and listened\\nto his voice, with reluctance. In fact, there were moments--for the\\nmost part, unexpected moments--when this reluctance bordered upon chill\\nhorror, and her face assumed a wild, corpse-like expression, and she\\nwould shut herself up in her bedroom, whence her maid, with ear glued\\nto the keyhole, would hear issue sounds as of dull, hopeless sobbing.\\nPaul Petrovitch himself frequently found that, when returning home\\nafter one of these tender interviews, there was naught within his\\nbreast save the bitter, galling sensation which comes of final and\\nirrevocable failure. \\'What more could I want?\\' he would say to himself\\nin his bewilderment; yet always he spoke with an aching heart.\\n\\n\"It happened that on one occasion he gave her a ring having a stone\\ncarved in the figure of the Sphinx.\\n\\n\"\\'What?\\' she exclaimed. \\'Do you offer me the Sphinx?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I do,\\' he replied. \\'The Sphinx is yourself.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I?\\' she queried with a slow lift of her enigmatical eyes. \\'You are\\nindeed flattering!\\'\\n\\n\"With the words went the ghost of a smile, while her eyes looked\\nstranger than ever.\\n\\n\"Even during the time that the Princess loved him things were difficult\\nfor Paul Petrovitch; but when she cooled in her affection for him (as\\nsoon happened) he came near to going out of his mind. Distracted with\\njealousy, he allowed her no rest, but followed her to such an extent\\nthat at length, worn out with his persistent overtures, she betook\\nherself on a tour abroad. Yet even then Paul Petrovitch listened to\\nneither the prayers of his friends nor the advice of his superior\\nofficers, but, resigning his commission, set out on the Princess\\'s\\ntrack. Thus four years were spent in hunting her down, and losing sight\\nof her again: and though, throughout, he felt ashamed of his conduct,\\nand disgusted with his lack of spirit, all was of no avail--her image,\\nthe baffling, bewitching, alluring image which ever flitted before\\nhis eyes, had implanted itself too deeply in his breast. At last--it\\nwas at Baden--the pair once more came together; and though it seemed\\nthat never had she loved him as she did now, before a month was over\\nanother rupture had occurred, and, this time, a final one, as, with a\\nlast flicker, the flame died down and went out. True, that the parting\\nwould come he had foreseen; yet still he sought to be friends with her\\n(as though friendship with such a woman could have been possible!), and\\nonly the fact that she quietly withdrew from Baden, and thenceforth\\nstudiously avoided him, baffled his purpose. Returning to Russia, he\\nendeavoured to resume his former mode of life: but neither by hook nor\\ncrook could he regain the old rut. As a man with a poisoned system\\nwanders hither and thither, so did he drive out, and retain all the\\ncustoms of a society _habitué_. Nay, he could even have boasted of\\ntwo or three new conquests. But no. What he wanted was obtainable\\nneither through himself nor others, since his whole power of initiative\\nwas gone, and his head gradually growing grey. To sit at his club,\\nto consume his soul in jaundice and _ennui_, to engage in bachelor\\ndisputes which failed to interest him--such was now become his sole\\noccupation. And, as we know, it is an occupation which constitutes the\\nworst of signs. Nor, for that matter, seems he to marriage to have\\ngiven a thought.\\n\\n\"Thus ten years elapsed in colourless, fruitless pursuits. Yet Paul\\nfound time pass swiftly, indeed, with amazing swiftness, for nowhere\\nin the world does it fly as it does in Russia (in prison only is its\\npassage said to be still swifter); wherefore there came at length a\\nnight when, while dining at his club, he heard that the Princess was\\ndead--that she had died in Paris in a state bordering upon insanity.\\nRising from the table, he fell to pacing the rooms of the club with a\\nface like that of a corpse, and only at intervals halting to watch the\\ntables of the card-players; until, his usual time for returning home\\nhaving arrived, he departed. Soon after he had reached his flat there\\nwas delivered for him a package containing the ring which he had given\\nto the Princess. The Sphinx on it was marked with a mark like the sign\\nof the cross, and enclosed also was a message to say that through the\\ncross had the enigma become solved.\\n\\n\"These things took place just at the time (early in \\'48) when Nikolai\\nPetrovitch had lost his wife, and removed to St. Petersburg; and\\nsince, also, the period of Nikolai\\'s marriage had coincided with the\\nearlier days of Paul\\'s acquaintance with the Princess, Paul had not\\nseen his brother since the day when the latter had settled in the\\ncountry. True, on returning from abroad, Paul had paid Nikolai a visit\\nwith the intention of staying with him for a couple of months, as a\\ncongratulatory compliment on his happiness; but the visit had lasted\\na week only, since the difference in the position of the two brothers\\nhad been too great, and even now, though that difference had diminished\\nsomewhat, owing to the fact that Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife,\\nand Paul Petrovitch his memories (after the Princess\\'s death he made\\nit his rule to try and forget her)--even now, I say, there existed the\\ndifference that, whereas Nikolai Petrovitch could look back upon a\\nlife well spent, and had a son rising to manhood, Paul Petrovitch was\\nstill a lonely bachelor, and, moreover, entering upon that dim, murky\\nperiod when regrets come to resemble hopes, and hopes are beginning to\\nresemble regrets, and youth is fled, and old age is fast approaching.\\nTo Paul Petrovitch that period was particularly painful, in that, in\\nlosing his past, he had lost his all.\\n\\n\"\\'I shall not invite you to come to Marino,\\' were Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s\\nwords to his brother. \\'Even when my wife was alive, you found the place\\ntedious; and now it would kill you.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Ah, but in those days I was young and foolish and full of vanity,\\'\\nreplied Paul Petrovitch. \\'Even though I may not have grown wiser, at\\nleast am I quieter. So, if you should be willing, I will gladly come\\nand make your place my permanent home.\\'\\n\\n\"For answer Nikolai Petrovitch embraced him; and though a year and a\\nhalf elapsed before Paul Petrovitch decided to carry out his intention,\\nonce settled on the estate, he has never left it--no, not even during\\nthe three winters spent by Nikolai Petrovitch with his son in St.\\nPetersburg. Meanwhile he has taken to reading books--more especially\\nEnglish books, and, in general, to ordering his life on the English\\npattern. Rarely, also, does he call upon his neighbours, but confines\\nhis excursions, for the most part, to attending election meetings,\\nwhere, as a rule, he holds his tongue, but occasionally amuses himself\\nby angering and alarming the older generation of landowners with\\nLiberal sallies. From the representatives of the younger generation he\\nholds entirely aloof. Yet both parties, though they reckon him haughty,\\naccord him respect. They do so because of his refined, aristocratic\\nmanners, and of what they have heard concerning his former conquests,\\nand of the fact that he dresses with exquisite taste, that he always\\noccupies the best suites in the best hotels, that he dines sumptuously\\nevery day, that once he took dinner with the Duke of Wellington at the\\nCourt of Louis Philippe, that invariably he takes about with him a\\nsilver _nécessaire_ and a travelling bath, that he diffuses rare and\\nagreeable perfumes, that he is a first-rate and universally successful\\nwhist-player, and that his honour is irreproachable. The ladies too\\nlook upon him as a man of charming melancholy: but with their sex he\\nhas long ceased to have anything to do.\\n\\n\"You see, then, Evgenii,\" wound up Arkady, \"that you have judged my\\nuncle very unfairly. Moreover, I have omitted to say that several times\\nhe has saved my father from ruin by making over to him the whole of\\nhis money (for they do not share the estate), and that he is always\\nready to help any one, and, in particular, that he stands up stoutly\\nfor the peasants, even though, when speaking to them, he pulls a wry\\nface, and, before beginning the interview, scents himself well with\\neau-de-Cologne.\"\\n\\n\"We all know what nerves like his mean,\" remarked Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Perhaps so. Yet his heart is in the right place; nor is he in any\\nway a fool. To myself especially has he given much useful advice,\\nespecially on the subject of women.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, ha! \\'Scalded with milk, one blows to cool another\\'s water.\\' That\\nis a truism.\"\\n\\n\"Finally, and to put matters shortly,\" resumed Arkady, \"he is a man\\ndesperately unhappy, not one who ought to be despised.\"\\n\\n\"_Who_ is despising him?\" exclaimed Bazarov. \"All that I say is that a\\nman who has staked his whole upon a woman\\'s love, and, on losing the\\nthrow, has turned crusty, and let himself drift to such an extent as\\nto become good for nothing--I say that such a man is not a man, a male\\ncreature at all. He is unhappy, you say; and certainly you know him\\nbetter than I do; but it is clear also that he has not yet cleansed\\nhimself of the fool. In other words, certain am I that, just because he\\noccasionally reads _Galignani_, and because, once a month, he saves a\\npeasant from distress for debt, he believes himself really to be a man\\nof action.\"\\n\\n\"But think of his upbringing!\" expostulated Arkady. \"Think of the\\nperiod in which he has lived his life!\"\\n\\n\"His upbringing?\" retorted Bazarov. \"Why, a man ought to _bring\\nhimself_ up, even as I had to do. And with regard to his period,\\nwhy should I, or any other man, be dependent upon periods? Rather,\\nwe ought to make periods dependent upon _us_. No, no, friend!\\nSensuality and frivolity it is that are at fault. For of what do the\\nso-called mysterious relations between a man and a woman consist? As\\nphysiologists, we know precisely of what they consist. And take the\\nanatomy of the eye. What in it justifies the guesswork whereof you\\nspeak? Such talk is so much Romanticism and nonsense and unsoundness\\nand artificiality. Let us go and inspect that beetle.\"\\n\\nAnd the two friends departed to Bazarov\\'s room, where he had already\\nsucceeded in creating a medical-surgical atmosphere which consorted\\nwell with the smell of cheap tobacco.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\nAt his brother\\'s interview with the steward (the latter was a tall,\\nthin man of shifty eyes who to every remark of Nikolai\\'s replied in\\nan unctuous, mellifluous voice: \"Very well, if so it please you\")\\nPaul Petrovitch did not long remain present. Recently the system of\\nestate-management had been reorganised on a new footing, and was\\ncreaking as loudly as an ungreased cartwheel or furniture which has\\nbeen fashioned of unseasoned wood. For the same reason, though never\\nactually giving way to melancholy, Nikolai Petrovitch often indulged\\nin moodiness and sighing, for the reason that it was clear that his\\naffairs would never prosper without money, and that the bulk of the\\nlatter had disappeared. As for Arkady\\'s statement that frequently Paul\\nPetrovitch had come to his brother\\'s assistance, it had been perfectly\\ntrue, for on more than one occasion had Paul been moved by the sight of\\nhis brother\\'s perplexity to walk slowly to the window, to plunge a hand\\ninto his pocket, to mutter, \"_Mais je puis vous donner de l\\'argent_,\"\\nand, lastly, to suit the action to the word. But on the day of which\\nwe are speaking Paul had no spare cash himself; wherefore he preferred\\nto remove himself elsewhere, and the more so in that the _minutiæ_ of\\nestate-management wearied him, and that he felt certain that, though\\npowerless to suggest a better way of doing business than the present\\none, he knew at least that Nikolai\\'s was at fault.\\n\\n\"He is not sufficiently practical,\" would be his reflection. \"He lets\\nthese fellows cheat him right and left.\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, Nikolai had a high opinion of Paul\\'s practicality,\\nand always sought his advice.\\n\\n\"I am a weak, easy-going fellow,\" he would say, \"and have spent the\\nwhole of my life in retirement; whereas you cannot have lived in the\\nworld for nothing--you know it well, and have the eye of an eagle.\"\\n\\nTo this Paul Petrovitch would make no reply: he would merely turn away\\nwithout attempting to undeceive his brother.\\n\\nAfter leaving Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s study, Paul traversed the corridor\\nwhich separated the front portion of the house from the rear, and, on\\nreaching a low doorway, halted in seeming indecision, tugged at his\\nmoustache for a moment, then tapped with his knuckles upon the panels.\\n\\n\"Who is there?\" replied Thenichka from within. \"Pray enter.\"\\n\\n\"It is I,\" said Paul Petrovitch as he opened the door.\\n\\nSpringing from the chair on which she had been seated with her baby,\\nshe handed the latter to the nurse-girl (who at once bore it from the\\nroom), and hastened to rearrange her bodice.\\n\\n\"Pardon me for having disturbed you,\" said Paul Petrovitch without\\nlooking at her, \"but my object in coming here is to ask you (for I\\nunderstand that you are sending in to the town to-day) if you would\\nprocure me a little green tea for my own personal use.\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" replied Thenichka. \"How much ought I to have ordered?\"\\n\\n\"I think that half a pound will suffice. But what a change!\" he went on\\nglancing around the room with an eye which included also in its purview\\nThenichka\\'s features. \"It is those curtains that I am referring to,\"\\nhe explained on seeing that she had failed to grasp his meaning.\\n\\n\"Yes--those curtains. They were given me by Nikolai Petrovitch himself,\\nand have been hung a long while.\"\\n\\n\"But it is a long time, remember, since last I paid you a visit. The\\nroom looks indeed comfortable, does it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thanks to Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s kindness,\" whispered Thenichka.\\n\\n\"And you find things better here than in the wing?\" continued Paul\\nPetrovitch politely--also, without the least shadow of a smile.\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"And who is lodged in the wing in your place?\"\\n\\n\"The laundry women.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch relapsed into silence, while Thenichka thought to\\nherself: \"I suppose he will go presently.\" So far from doing so,\\nhowever, he remained where he was, and she had to continue standing\\nin front of him with her fingers nervelessly locking and unlocking\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\"Why have you had the little one taken away?\" at length he inquired. \"I\\nlove children. Pray show him to me.\"\\n\\nThenichka reddened with confusion and pleasure; and that though Paul\\nPetrovitch was accustomed to make her nervous, so seldom did he address\\nher.\\n\\n\"Duniasha!\" she cried (Duniasha she addressed, as she did every one\\nin the house, in the second person plural[1]). \"Bring Mitia here, and\\nbe quick about it! But first put on his clothes.\" With that she moved\\ntowards the door.\\n\\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" said Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"But I shall soon be back.\" And she disappeared.\\n\\nLeft alone, Paul looked about him with keen attention. The small,\\nlow room in which he was waiting was clean and comfortable, and\\nredolent of balm, camomile, and furniture polish. Against the walls\\nstood straight-backed, lyre-shaped chairs which the late General had\\npurchased during the period of the Polish campaign; in one corner\\nstood a bedstead under a muslin coverlet, with, flanking it, a large,\\niron-clamped, convex-lidded chest; in the opposite corner burnt a\\nlamp before a massive, smoke-blackened _ikon_ of Saint Nikolai the\\nMiracle Worker--the Saint\\'s halo suspended by a red riband, and a tiny\\nchina egg resting on his breast; on the window-sills were ranged some\\ncarefully sealed jars of last year\\'s jam, which filtered the light to\\ngreen, and of which the parchment covers were inscribed, in Thenichka\\'s\\nlarge handwriting, \"Gooseberry\"--a jam of which Nikolai Petrovitch\\nwas particularly fond; from the ceiling hung, by a long cord, a cage\\ncontaining a short-tailed siskin which kept up such a perpetual\\ntwittering and hopping that its cage rocked to and fro as it sang, and\\nstray hemp seeds came pattering lightly to the floor; on the wall space\\nabove a small chest of drawers hung a few poorly executed photographs\\nof Nikolai Petrovitch in various attitudes (the work of a travelling\\nphotographer); alongside these photographs hung a very unsuccessful one\\nof Thenichka herself, since it revealed nothing but an eyeless face\\npeering painfully from a dark frame; and, lastly, above the portrait\\nof Thenichka hung a picture of Ermolov in a big cloak and a portentous\\nfrown--the latter directed principally towards a distant mountain range\\nof the Caucasus, while over the forehead of the portrait dangled a\\nsilken pincushion in the shape of a shoe.\\n\\nFor five minutes or so there came from the adjoining room a sound as of\\nrustling and whispering. From the chest of drawers Paul Petrovitch took\\nup a greasy, dog\\'s-eared volume of Masalsky\\'s _The Strielitsi_, and\\nturned over a few of its pages. Suddenly the door opened, and Thenichka\\nentered with Mitia, whom she had now vested in a red robe and beaded\\ncollar, while his little head had been brushed, and also his face\\nwashed. Though he was breathing stertorously, and wriggling his whole\\nbody about, and twitching his tiny arms after the manner of all healthy\\nchildren, the dainty robe had had its effect, and his face was puckered\\nwith delight. Also, Thenichka had tidied her own hair, and rearranged\\nher bodice--well enough though she would have done as she was. For,\\nin all the world, is there a more entrancing spectacle than that of a\\nyoung, handsome mother with, in her arms, a healthy child?\\n\\n\"What a little beauty!\" Paul Petrovitch exclaimed indulgently as he\\ntickled Mitia\\'s double chin with the tip of his forefinger. The baby\\nfixed its eyes upon the siskin, and smiled.\\n\\n\"This is Uncle,\" said Thenichka as she bent over the boy and gave him\\na gentle shake. For fumigating purposes Duniasha deposited upon the\\nwindow-sill a lighted candle, and, beneath it, a two-kopeck piece.\\n\\n\"How old is he?\" asked Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"Six months. On the eleventh of this month he will be seven.\"\\n\\n\"No, eight, will he not, Theodosia Nikolaievna?\" timidly corrected\\nDuniasha.\\n\\n\"No, seven.\"\\n\\nHere the infant crowed, fixed his eyes upon the chest in the corner,\\nand suddenly closed his five tiny fingers upon his mother\\'s mouth and\\nnose.\\n\\n\"The little rascal!\" she said, without, however, freeing her features\\nfrom his grasp.\\n\\n\"He is very like my brother,\" commented Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"Whom else should he be like?\" she thought.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he continued, half to himself. \"Undoubtedly I see the likeness.\"\\nHe gazed pensively, almost mournfully, at the young mother.\\n\\n\"This is Uncle,\" again she said to the child: but this time she said it\\nunder her breath.\\n\\n\"Oh, here you are, Paul!\" cried Nikolai Petrovitch from behind them.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch faced about and knit his brows. But so joyously, and\\nwith such a grateful expression, was his brother regarding the trio\\nthat Paul could only respond with a smile.\\n\\n\"He is a fine little fellow, this baby of yours,\" the elder brother\\nobserved. Then, glancing at his watch, he added: \"I came here merely to\\narrange about the purchase of some tea.\" With which he assumed an air\\nof indifference, and left the room.\\n\\n\"He came here of his own accord, did he?\" was Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s\\nfirst inquiry.\\n\\n\"Yes, of his own accord,\" the girl replied. \"He just knocked at the\\ndoor and entered.\"\\n\\n\"And what of Arkasha? Has he too been to see you?\"\\n\\n\"No, Nikolai Petrovitch. By the way, might I return to the rooms in the\\nwing of the house?\"\\n\\n\"Why do you want to?\"\\n\\n\"Because they suit me better than these.\"\\n\\n\"I think not,\" said Nikolai Petrovitch, rubbing his forehead with an\\nair of indecision. \"Before there was a reason for your being there, but\\nthat reason no longer exists.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, little rascal!\" was his next remark as, with a sudden\\naccess of animation, he approached and kissed the baby\\'s cheek. Then,\\nbending a little, he pressed his lips to Thenichka\\'s hand--a hand,\\nagainst the red of Mitia\\'s robe, as white as milk.\\n\\n\"Why have you done that, Nikolai Petrovitch?\" she murmured with\\ndowncast eyes. Yet when she raised them, their expression, as she\\nglanced from under her brows and smiled her caressing, but slightly\\nvacant, smile, was charming indeed!\\n\\nOf the circumstances of Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s first meeting with\\nThenichka the following may be related. Three years ago it had fallen\\nto his lot to spend a night at an inn in a remote country town; and,\\nwhile doing so, he had been struck with the cleanliness of the room\\nassigned him, and also with the freshness of the bed-linen. \"Clearly,\"\\nhe had thought to himself, \"the landlady must be a German.\" But, as it\\nhad turned out, she was not a German, but a Russian of about fifty,\\nwell-dressed, and possessed both of a comely, intelligent countenance\\nand of a refined manner of speaking. When breakfast was over, he had\\nhad a long conversation with her, and conceived for her a great liking.\\nNow, as fate would have it, he had just removed to his new house, and,\\nowing to a reluctance to continue keeping bonded serfs, was on the\\nlook-out for hired domestics; while she, for her part, was in despair\\nover the question of the hard times, which caused only a limited\\nnumber of visitors to resort to the town. In the end, therefore,\\nNikolai Petrovitch proposed to her to come to his house as housekeeper;\\nand to this proposal, (since her husband was dead, and her family\\nconsisted only of a young daughter named Thenichka) she eventually\\nagreed. Accordingly, within two weeks Arina Savishna (such was the\\nnew housekeeper\\'s name) arrived at Marino with her child, and took up\\nher abode in the wing of the new manor-house; nor was it long before\\nshe had put the place to rights. To Thenichka, however, then a girl\\nof sixteen, she never referred; and few people even caught a glimpse\\nof the maiden, since she lived a life so modest and retired that only\\non Sundays could Nikolai Petrovitch contemplate the delicate profile\\nof her face in an aisle of the parish church. More than a year thus\\nelapsed.\\n\\nBut one morning Arina entered his study, bowed to him as usual, and\\nrequested him to be so good as to come and help her with her daughter,\\none of whose eyes had been injured with a spark from the stove. It so\\nhappened that, like most men of sedentary habit, Nikolai Petrovitch had\\npicked up a smattering of medicine--nay, he had even compiled a list\\nof homoeopathic remedies for one and another emergency; wherefore he\\nhastened to order Arina to produce the sufferer. As soon as she heard\\nthat the _barin_ had sent for her, Thenichka turned very nervous, but\\nfollowed her mother as in duty bound; whereupon Nikolai Petrovitch\\nled her to the window, took her head in his hands, and, after an\\ninspection of the red, inflamed eye, wrote out a prescription for a\\nlotion, compounded the stuff himself, and, lastly, tore off a portion\\nof his handkerchief, and showed her how best the eye could be bathed.\\nMeanwhile Thenichka listened attentively, and then tried to leave the\\nroom. \"But the idea of going away without kissing the _barin\\'s_ hand,\\nfoolish one!\" cried Arina; whereupon, in lieu of offering the girl\\nhis hand, Nikolai Petrovitch felt so embarrassed that in the end he\\nhimself kissed her bent head at the spot where the hair lay parted.\\nSoon Thenichka\\'s eye healed, but the impression produced upon Nikolai\\nPetrovitch did not pass away so quickly. Continually there flitted\\nbefore him a pure, tender, timidly upturned face; continually he could\\nfeel between the palms of his hands soft coils of hair; continually\\nappearing to his vision there would be a pair of innocent, half-parted\\nlips between which a set of pearl-like teeth flashed back the sunlight.\\nConsequently he began to observe the girl more in church, and to try\\nto engage her in conversation. But shyness always overcame her, and,\\non one occasion when she happened to meet him on a narrow path through\\na rye field, she turned aside, and plunged into the mass of tall\\ngrain and undergrowth of cornflowers and wormwood. Yet, despite her\\nendeavours to escape, his eye discerned her head amid the golden mesh\\nof cornblades, and he called to her, as she gazed at him with wild eyes:\\n\\n\"Good morning, Thenichka! I shall not hurt you.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, _barin_!\" she whispered in reply, but did not leave her\\nretreat.\\n\\nAs time went on, however, she grew more accustomed to his presence; and\\nby the time that she was beginning really to get over her bashfulness,\\nher mother died of cholera. Here was a dilemma indeed! For what was\\nto be done with the young Thenichka, who had inherited her mother\\'s\\nlove of orderliness, and also her mother\\'s good sense and natural\\nrefinement? In the end, she was so young and lonely, and Nikolai\\nPetrovitch was so good-hearted and modest, that the inevitable came\\nabout. The rest need not be related.\\n\\n\"So my brother has been to you?\" he inquired again. \"You say that he\\njust knocked at the door and entered?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he just knocked at the door and entered.\"\\n\\n\"Good! Now, hand me Mitia.\"\\n\\nAnd Nikolai Petrovitch fell to tossing the baby up and down towards the\\nceiling--a proceeding which greatly delighted the little one, but as\\ngreatly disquieted the mother, who, at each upward flight, stretched\\nher hands in the direction of the infant\\'s naked toes.\\n\\nMeanwhile Paul Petrovitch returned to his study, of which the walls\\nwere lined with a paper of red wild roses, and hung with weapons; the\\nfloor was covered with a striped Persian carpet; and the furniture,\\nconsisting of a Renaissance bookcase in old black oak, a handsome\\nwriting-table, a few bronze statuettes, and a stove, was constructed,\\nfor the most part, of hazelwood, and upholstered in dark-green velvet.\\nStretching himself upon a sofa, he clasped his hands behind his head,\\nand remained staring at the ceiling. Did presently the thoughts which\\nwere passing through his mind need to be concealed even from the walls,\\nseeing that he rose, unhooked the heavy curtains from before the\\nwindows, and replaced himself upon the sofa?\\n\\n\\n[1] Used, as in French, in formal speech or that of a person addressing\\na social superior.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nThe same day also saw Bazarov make Thenichka\\'s acquaintance. This was\\nwhen he was walking in the garden with Arkady, and discussing the\\nquestion of why certain trees in the garden, especially oaks, had not\\nprospered as they might have done. Said he:\\n\\n\"You ought to plant the place with as many silver poplars as you can,\\nand also with Norwegian firs--limes too, if loam should first be added.\\nFor instance, the reason why this clump has done so well is that it is\\nmade up of lilacs and acacias, of which neither require much room. But\\nhullo! There is some one sitting there!\"\\n\\nThe persons seated in the arbour were Thenichka, Duniasha, and little\\nMitia. Bazarov halted, and Arkady nodded to Thenichka as to an old\\nacquaintance. Then the pair passed on again, and Bazarov inquired of\\nhis companion:\\n\\n\"Who was she?\"\\n\\n\"To whom are you referring?\"\\n\\n\"You know to whom. My word, she _is_ good-looking!\"\\n\\nArkady explained, with a touch of embarrassment, the identity of\\nThenichka.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Bazarov remarked. \"Then your father has not at all bad taste.\\nIndeed, I commend it. But what a young dog he is! I too must be\\nintroduced.\"\\n\\nAnd he turned back in the direction of the arbour.\\n\\n\"Evgenii!\" exclaimed Arkady nervously as he followed his friend. \"For\\nGod\\'s sake be careful what you do!\"\\n\\n\"You need not be alarmed. I know what is what. I am no rustic.\"\\n\\nAnd, approaching Thenichka, he doffed his cap.\\n\\n\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" he said with a polite bow. \"I am a\\nfriend of Arkady\\'s, and a perfectly harmless individual.\"\\n\\nRising from her seat, Thenichka gazed at him in silence.\\n\\n\"Oh, and what a fine baby!\" he continued. \"Pray do not disturb\\nyourself. Never yet have I cast upon a child an evil spell. But why are\\nhis cheeks so red? Is he cutting teeth?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Thenichka. \"He has now cut four of them, and the gums\\nare a little swelled.\"\\n\\n\"Then let me see them. Do not be afraid. I am a doctor.\"\\n\\nWith that he took the baby into his arms, and both Thenichka and\\nDuniasha were astonished at the fact that it made no resistance, showed\\nno fear.\\n\\n\"I see,\" he continued. \"Well, everything is going right with him, and\\nhe will have plenty of teeth. Nevertheless, should he in any way ail,\\nplease let me know. Are you yourself well?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thank God!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Thank God,\\' say I too, for health on the part of the mother is\\nthe chief point of all. And you?\" he added, turning to Duniasha.\\nThe latter, ultra-prim of demeanour in the drawing-room, and\\nultra-frivolous of behaviour in the kitchen, answered with a giggle.\\n\\n\"Well, you _look_ all right. Here! Take your hero back again.\"\\n\\nHe replaced the baby in Thenichka\\'s arms.\\n\\n\"How quiet he has been with you!\" she exclaimed under her breath.\\n\\n\"Always children are quiet with me,\" he remarked. \"You see, I know how\\nto handle them.\"\\n\\n\"And _they_ know when people are fond of them,\" put in Duniasha.\\n\\n\"True,\" assented Thenichka. \"Though it is seldom that Mitia will go to\\nany one\\'s arms but mine.\"\\n\\n\"Would he come to me?\" ventured Arkady, who, until now standing in\\nthe background, at this moment came forward towards the arbour. But\\non his attempting to wheedle Mitia to his arms, the infant threw back\\nits head, and started to cry--a circumstance which greatly perturbed\\nThenichka.\\n\\n\"Another time--when he has come to be more used to me,\" said Arkady\\nindulgently. And the two friends departed.\\n\\n\"What is her name?\" asked Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Thenichka--Theodosia,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\n\"And her patronymic?\"\\n\\n\"Nikolaievna.\"\\n\\n\"_Bene_! What I like about her is her total absence of shyness. True,\\nthat is a _trait_ which some might have condemned in her, but I say,\\n\\'What rubbish!\\' For why need she be bashful? She is a mother, and\\ntherefore justified.\"\\n\\n\"I agree,\" said Arkady. \"And my father----\"\\n\\n\"Also is justified,\" concluded Bazarov.\\n\\n\"No, I do not agree in that respect.\"\\n\\n\"You do not altogether welcome a superfluous heir?\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Evgenii!\" cried Arkady heatedly. \"How can you impute such\\nmotives? What I mean is that my father is not justified from _one_\\npoint of view. That is to say, he ought to marry her.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, ho!\" said Bazarov quietly. \"How high and mighty we are getting! So\\nyou still attribute importance to the marriage rite? This I should not\\nhave expected of you.\"\\n\\nFor some paces the friends walked on in silence. Then Bazarov\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\"I have been inspecting your father\\'s establishment. The cattle look\\npoor, the horses seem broken-down, the buildings have a tipsy air, the\\nworkmen manifest a tendency to loaf, and I cannot yet determine whether\\nthe new steward is a fool or a rogue.\"\\n\\n\"You are censorious to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I am; and the reason is that these good peasants are cheating your\\nfather--exemplifying the proverb that \\'The Russian _muzhik_ will break\\neven the back of God.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Soon I shall have to agree with my uncle in his opinion that you think\\nbut poorly of Russia.\"\\n\\n\"Rubbish! The Russian\\'s very best point is that he holds a poor opinion\\nof _himself_. Two and two make four. Nothing but that matters.\"\\n\\n\"And is nature also rubbish?\" queried Arkady with a musing glance at\\nthe mottled fields where they lay basking in the soft, kindly rays of\\nthe morning sun.\\n\\n\"Nature _is_ rubbish--at least in the sense in which _you_ understand\\nher. She is not a church, but a workshop wherein man is the labourer.\"\\n\\nAt this moment there came wafted to their ears the long-drawn strains\\nof a violoncello, on which a sensitive, but inexperienced, hand was\\nplaying Schubert\\'s _Erwartung_. Like honey did the voluptuous melody\\nsuffuse the air.\\n\\n\"Who is the musician?\" asked Bazarov in astonishment.\\n\\n\"My father.\"\\n\\n\"What? Your father plays the \\'cello?\"\\n\\n\"He does.\"\\n\\n\"At his age?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--he is only forty-four.\"\\n\\nBazarov burst out laughing.\\n\\n\"Why do you laugh?\" asked Arkady.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, but the idea that your father--a man of forty-four, a\\npaterfamilias, and a notable in the county--should play the \\'cello!\"\\n\\nAnd he continued laughing, though Arkady, for all his reverence for his\\nmentor, failed to accomplish even a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two weeks life at Marino pursued its normal course.\\nArkady took things easily, and Bazarov worked. In passing, it may be\\nsaid that, for all his careless manner and abrupt, laconic speech, the\\nlatter had become an accepted phenomenon in the house. In particular\\nhad Thenichka so completely lost her shyness of him that one night\\nshe sent to awake him because Mitia had been seized with convulsions;\\nwhereupon Bazarov arrived, and, half-joking, half-yawning, according\\nto his usual manner, helped her for two hours in the task of attending\\nto the baby. Only Paul Petrovitch disliked the man with the whole\\nstrength of his soul, for he accounted him a proud, cynical, conceited\\nplebeian, and suspected him not only of failing to respect, but even of\\nholding in contempt, the personality of Paul Petrovitch Kirsanov. Also,\\nNikolai Petrovitch stood in slight awe of the young Nihilist, since he\\ndoubted the likelihood of any good accruing from Bazarov\\'s influence\\nover Arkady. Yet always he would listen with pleasure to Bazarov\\'s\\ndiscourses, and gladly attend the chemical or physical experiments with\\nwhich the young doctor (who had brought a microscope with him) would\\noccupy himself for hours at a stretch. On the other hand, in spite of\\nBazarov\\'s domineering manner, all the servants had become attached\\nto him, for they felt him to be less a _barin_ than their brother;\\nand in particular did Duniasha readily joke and talk with him, and\\nthrow him many meaning glances as she sped past in quail-like fashion,\\nwhile Peter himself, though a man full of conceit and stupidity, with\\na forehead perpetually puckered, and a dignity which consisted of a\\ndeferential demeanour, a practice of reading journals syllable by\\nsyllable, and a habit of constantly brushing his coat; even Peter,\\nI say, would brighten and strike an attitude when he was noticed\\nby Bazarov. In fact, the only servant to disapprove of Bazarov was\\nold Prokofitch, the butler, who looked sour whenever he handed the\\nyoung doctor a dish, and called him a \"sharper\" and a \"flaunter,\" and\\ndeclared that, for all his whiskers, Bazarov was no better than \"a\\ndressed-up pig,\" whereas he, Prokofitch, was practically as good an\\naristocrat as Paul Petrovitch himself.\\n\\nIn the early days of June, the best season of the year, the weather\\nbecame beautiful. True, from afar there came threatenings of cholera,\\nbut to the local inhabitants such visitations had become a commonplace.\\nEach day Bazarov rose early to set forth upon a tramp of some two or\\nthree versts; nor were those tramps undertaken merely for the sake of\\nthe exercise (he could not abide aimless expeditions), but, rather,\\nfor the sake of collecting herbs and insects. Sometimes, too, he would\\nsucceed in inducing Arkady to accompany him; and whenever this was the\\ncase the pair would, on the way back, engage in some dispute which\\nalways left Arkady vanquished in spite of his superior profusion of\\nargument.\\n\\nOne morning the pair lingered considerably by the way, and Nikolai\\nPetrovitch set out across the garden to meet them. Just as he reached\\nthe arbour, he heard their voices and brisk footsteps approaching,\\nthough he himself was invisible to the returning friends.\\n\\n\"You do not understand my father,\" Arkady was saying.\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch halted instead of revealing himself.\\n\\n\"Oh, he is a good fellow enough,\" replied Bazarov. \"But also he is a\\nman on the shelf, a man whose song has been sung.\"\\n\\nThough Nikolai Petrovitch strained his ears, he failed to catch\\nArkady\\'s reply. So the \"man on the shelf\" lingered for a minute or\\ntwo--then walked slowly back to the house.\\n\\n\"For the past three days I have noted him reading Pushkin,\" continued\\nBazarov. \"You ought to explain to him that no good can come of that,\\nfor he is no longer a boy, and ought to have shaken himself free of\\nsuch fiddlesticks. Who would desire to be a Romanticist? Give him\\nsomething _practical_.\"\\n\\n\"For instance?\"\\n\\n\"Let me consider. For a start, give him Büchner\\'s[1] _Stoff und Kraft_.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" Arkady\\'s tone was approving. \"_Stoff und Kraft_ is at least\\nwritten in a popular style.\"\\n\\nThe same day Nikolai Petrovitch was sitting with his brother. At length\\nhe said:\\n\\n\"I find that you and I are men on the shelf, that our songs have been\\nsung. Eh? And perhaps Bazarov is right. Yet I confess that one thing\\nhurts me: and that is that, though I had hoped to draw nearer to\\nArkady, I am being left in the rear, and he is for ever marching ahead.\\nNo longer do he and I understand one another.\"\\n\\n\"And why is he for ever marching ahead?\" asked Paul Petrovitch\\nindignantly. \"How comes he to stand at such a distance from us? The\\nreason is simply the ideas which that precious \\'Nihilist\\' is putting\\ninto his head. For myself, I detest the fellow, and think him a\\ncharlatan. Also, I am certain that, in spite of his frogs, he is making\\nno real progress in physics.\"\\n\\n\"We ought not to say that, brother. For my own part, I look upon him as\\na man of culture and ability.\"\\n\\n\"If so, a detestably conceited one.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he _is_ conceited,\" Nikolai Petrovitch allowed. \"But then it\\nwould appear that nothing can be done without something of the kind.\\nWhat I cannot make out is the following. As you know, I have done\\neverything possible to keep up with the times--I have organised my\\npeasantry, I have set up such a farm that throughout the province I am\\nknown as \\'Fine Kirsanov,\\' persistently I read and educate myself, in\\ngeneral I try to march abreast of the needs of the day. Yet, though I\\ndo all this, I am now given to understand that my day is past and gone!\\nAnd, brother, I do not say that I am not partially inclined to accept\\nthat view.\"\\n\\n\"For what reason?\"\\n\\n\"For the following. To-day, as I was reading Pushkin (I think it was\\n\\'The Gipsies\\' that I had lighted upon), there suddenly entered the room\\nArkady. Silently, and with an air of kindly regret, and as gently as a\\nchild, he withdrew the book from my hand, and laid before me another\\nbook--a German production of some kind. That done, he gave me another\\nsmile, and departed with my volume of Pushkin under his arm.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! And what might be the book which he has given you?\"\\n\\n\"This.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch extracted from the tail pocket of his frock-coat a\\ncopy (ninth edition) of Büchner\\'s well-known work.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch turned it over in his hands.\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" he grunted. \"Arkady does indeed seem solicitous for your\\neducation! Have you tried reading the book?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you like it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, either I am a fool or the thing is rubbish. Of the two views,\\nthe former seems to me the most probable.\"\\n\\n\"It is not because you have forgotten your German, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no. I understand the language perfectly.\"\\n\\nAgain Paul Petrovitch turned over the book, and again he glanced at his\\nbrother from under his brows. A moment\\'s silence ensued.\\n\\n\"By the way,\" continued Nikolai Petrovitch with an evident desire to\\nchange the conversation, \"I have received a letter from Koliazin.\"\\n\\n\"From Matvei Ilyitch?\"\\n\\n\"From the same. It seems that he has just arrived at ----, for the\\npurpose of carrying out the Revision[2] of the province, and he writes\\nvery civilly that, as our kinsman, he would be glad to see Arkady and\\nyou and myself.\"\\n\\n\"Do you intend to accept his invitation?\" asked Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"I do not. Do you?\"\\n\\n\"No. We have no need to drag ourselves fifty versts to eat blanc-mange.\\nThe good Mathieu wants to show off a little--that is all. He can\\ndo without us. But what an honour to be a Privy Councillor! Had I\\ncontinued in the Service, continued hauling at the old tow-rope, I\\nmyself might have been Adjutant-General! As it is, I, like yourself, am\\non the shelf.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, brother. Clearly it is time that we ordered our tombstones, and\\nfolded our hands upon our breasts.\"\\n\\nA sigh concluded Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s speech.\\n\\n\"But _I_ do not intend to give in so soon,\" muttered his brother.\\n\"There is first going to be a skirmish between that chirurgeon of\\nArkady\\'s and myself. That I can see beyond a doubt.\"\\n\\nAnd, sure enough, the \"skirmish\" occurred the same evening. Ready for\\nbattle as soon he repaired to the drawing-room for tea, Paul Petrovitch\\nentered angrily, but firmly, and sat waiting for an excuse to advance\\nupon the foe. Yet for a while that excuse hung fire, since Bazarov\\nnever said much in the presence of \"the old Kirsanovs,\" and to-night\\nwas feeling out of spirits, and drank his tea in absolute silence.\\nHowever, Paul Petrovitch was so charged with impatience that his wish\\nwas bound to attain fulfilment.\\n\\nIt happened that the conversation became turned upon a neighbouring\\nlandowner.\\n\\n\"He is just a petty aristocrat,\" Bazarov drily remarked (it seemed that\\nhe and the landowner had met in St. Petersburg).\\n\\n\"Allow me,\" put in Paul Petrovitch, his lips quivering. \"In your view,\\ndo the terms \\'good-for-nothing\\' and \\'aristocrat\\' connote the same\\nthing?\"\\n\\n\"I said \\'_petty_ aristocrat,\\'\" replied Bazarov as he lazily sipped his\\ntea.\\n\\n\"Quite so. Then I take it that you hold the same opinion of aristocrats\\nas of \\'petty aristocrats\\'? Well, I may remark that your opinion is not\\nmine. And to that I would add that, while I myself possess a reputation\\nfor Liberal and progressive views, I possess that reputation for the\\nvery reason that I can respect _real_ aristocrats. For instance, my\\ndear sir\" (the latter term was so heatedly uttered that Bazarov raised\\nhis eyebrows), \"for instance, my dear sir, take the aristocracy of\\nEngland. While yielding upon their rights not an iota, they yet know\\nhow to respect the rights of others. While demanding fulfilment of\\nobligations due to themselves, they yet fulfil their own obligations.\\nAnd for those reasons it is to her aristocratic caste that England\\nstands indebted for her freedom. It is because the English aristocratic\\ncaste itself supports that freedom.\"\\n\\n\"A tale which we have heard many times before!\" commented Bazarov. \"But\\nwhat are you seeking to prove?\"\\n\\n\"I am seeking to prove this,\" replied Paul Petrovitch. \"That without\\na certain sense of personal dignity, without a sense of self-respect\\n(both of which senses are inborn in the true aristocrat), the social\\nedifice, the _bien public_, cannot rest upon a durable basis. It is\\n_personality_ that matters, my dear sir: and the human personality\\nrequires to be as firm as a rock, in that there rests upon it the\\nentire structure of society. For example, I know that you ridicule\\nmy customs, my dress, my fastidious tastes. Yet do those very things\\nproceed from that sense of duty--yes, of duty, I repeat--to which I\\nhave just alluded. In other words, I may live in the depths of the\\ncountry, yet I do not let myself go. For I respect in myself the man.\"\\n\\n\"Allow me, Paul Petrovitch,\" said Bazarov. \"You say that you respect\\nyourself. Very good. Yet you can sit there with your hands folded!\\nHow will _that_ benefit the _bien public_, seeing that inaction would\\nscarcely seem to argue self-respect?\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch blanched a little.\\n\\n\"That is another question altogether,\" he said. \"However, I do not\\nfeel called upon to explain the reason why I sit with my hands folded\\n(according to your own estimable term). It will suffice merely to\\nremark that in the aristocratic idea there is contained a _principle_,\\nand that nowadays men who live without principles are as destitute of\\nmorality as they are of moral substance. The same thing did I say to\\nArkady on the day after his arrival, and I say it now to you. You agree\\nwith me, Nikolai, do you not?\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch nodded assent, while Bazarov exclaimed:\\n\\n\"The aristocratic idea, forsooth! Liberalism, progress, principles!\\nWhy, have you ever considered the vanity of those terms? The Russian of\\nto-day does not need them.\"\\n\\n\"Then what, in your opinion, does he need? To listen to you, one would\\nsuppose that we stood wholly divorced from humanity and humanity\\'s\\nlaws; whereas, pardon me, the logic of history demands----\"\\n\\n\"What has that logic to do with us? We can get on quite well without\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"How can we do so?\"\\n\\n\"Even as I have said. When you want to put a piece of bread into your\\nmouth do you need logic for the purpose? What have these abstractions\\nto do with ourselves?\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch waved his hand in disgust.\\n\\n\"I cannot understand you,\" he said. \"You seem to me to be insulting\\nthe Russian people. How you or any one else can decline to recognise\\nprinciples and precepts is a thing which passes my comprehension. For\\nwhat other basis for action in life have we got?\"\\n\\nArkady put in a word.\\n\\n\"Both I and Bazarov have told you,\" he said, \"that we recognise no\\nauthority of any sort.\"\\n\\n\"Rather, that we recognise no basis for action save the useful,\"\\ncorrected Bazarov. \"At present the course most useful is denial.\\nTherefore we deny.\"\\n\\n\"Deny everything?\"\\n\\n\"Deny everything.\"\\n\\n\"What? Both poetry and art and--I find it hard to express it?----\"\\n\\n\"I repeat, _everything_,\" said Bazarov with an ineffable expression of\\n_insouciance_.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch stared. He had not quite expected this. For his part,\\nArkady reddened with pleasure.\\n\\n\"Allow me,\" interposed Nikolai Petrovitch. \"You say that you deny\\neverything--rather, that you would consign everything to destruction.\\nBut also you ought to construct.\"\\n\\n\"That is not our business,\" said Bazarov. \"First must the site be\\ncleared.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; for the present condition of the people demands it,\" affirmed\\nArkady. \"And that demand we are bound to fulfil, seeing that no one\\nhas the right merely to devote himself to the satisfaction of his own\\npersonal egotism.\"\\n\\nWith this last Bazarov did not seem altogether pleased, since the\\nphrase smacked too much of philosophy--rather, of \"Romanticism,\" as\\nBazarov termed that science; but he did not trouble to confute his\\npupil.\\n\\n\"No, no!\" Paul Petrovitch exclaimed with sudden heat. \"I _cannot_\\nbelieve that gentlemen of your type possess sufficient knowledge of the\\npeople to be rightful representatives of its demands and aspirations.\\nFor the Russian people is not what you think it to be. It holds\\ntraditions sacred, and is patriarchal, and cannot live without faith.\"\\n\\n\"I will not dispute that,\" observed Bazarov. \"Nay, I will even agree\\nthat you are right.\"\\n\\n\"And, granting that I am right----\"\\n\\n\"You have proved nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, proved nothing,\" echoed Arkady with the assurance of a\\nchess-player who, having foreseen a dangerous move on the part of his\\nopponent, awaits the attack with expert composure.\\n\\n\"But how have I proved nothing?\" muttered Paul Petrovitch, rather taken\\naback. \"Do you mean to say that you are opposed to, not in favour of,\\nthe people?\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Do not the common folk believe, when it thunders, that\\nthe Prophet Elijah is going up to Heaven in his chariot? You and I do\\nnot agree with that? The point is that the people is Russian, and that\\nI am the same.\"\\n\\n\"Not after what you have just said! Henceforth must I decline to\\nrecognise you as any countryman of mine.\"\\n\\nWith a sort of indolent _hauteur_ Bazarov replied:\\n\\n\"With his own hand did my grandfather guide the plough. Ask, therefore,\\nof your favourite peasant which of us two--you or myself--he rates most\\ntruly as his countryman. Why, you do not know even how to speak to him!\"\\n\\n\"And you, while speaking to him, despise him.\"\\n\\n\"Should he merit contempt, yes. Reprobate, therefore, my views as much\\nas you like, but who told you that they have come to me fortuitously\\nrather than been derived from the very national spirit of which you are\\nso ardent an upholder?\"\\n\\n\"Phaugh! We need you Nihilists, do we not?\"\\n\\n\"Not ours is it to decide the need or otherwise, seeing that even a man\\nlike yourself considers that he has a use.\"\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" interposed Nikolai Petrovitch as he rose to his\\nfeet. \"I beg of you to indulge in no personalities!\"\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch smiled. Then, laying his hand upon his brother\\'s\\nshoulder, he forced him to resume his seat.\\n\\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" he said. \"That very sense of dignity at which this\\ngentleman pokes such bitter fun will keep me from forgetting myself.\"\\n\\nAnd he turned to Bazarov again.\\n\\n\"Do you suppose your doctrine to be a new one?\" he continued. \"If so,\\nyou are wasting your time. More than once has the Materialism which you\\npreach been mooted; and each time it has been proved bankrupt.\"\\n\\n\"Another foreign term!\" muttered Bazarov. He was now beginning to lose\\nhis temper, and his face had turned a dull, copperish tint. \"In the\\nfirst place, we Nihilists preach nothing at all. For to preach is not\\nour custom.\"\\n\\n\"What, then, is your custom?\"\\n\\n\"To proclaim facts such as that our civil servants accept bribes, that\\nwe lack highways, commerce, and a single upright judge, and that----\"\\n\\n\"Of course, of course! In other words, you and yours are to act as our\\n\\'censors\\' (I believe that to be the correct term?). Well, I agree with\\nmany of your censures, but----\"\\n\\n\"Other tenets which we hold are that to chatter, and to do nothing but\\nchatter, concerning our differences is not worth the trouble, seeing\\nthat it is a pursuit which merely leads to pettiness and doctrinairism;\\nthat beyond question are our so-called leaders and censors not worth\\ntheir salt, seeing that they engage in sheer futilities, and waste\\ntheir breath on discussions on art and still life and Parliamentarism\\nand legal points and the devil only knows what, when all the time it is\\nthe bread of subsistence alone that matters, and we are being stifled\\nwith gross superstition, and all our commercial enterprises are failing\\nfor want of honest directors, and the freedom of which the Government\\nis for ever prating is destined never to become a reality, for the\\nreason that, so long as the Russian peasant is allowed to go and drink\\nhimself to death in a dram-shop, he is ready to submit to any sort of\\ndespoilment.\"\\n\\n\"You have decided, then, you feel conscious, that your true _métier_ is\\nto apply yourselves seriously to nothing?\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" came the sullen reply, for Bazarov had suddenly become vexed\\nwith himself for having exposed his mind with such completeness to this\\n_barin_.\\n\\n\"You have decided merely to deny everything?\"\\n\\n\"We have decided merely to deny everything.\"\\n\\n\"And that you call Nihilism?\"\\n\\n\"That we call Nihilism.\" In Bazarov\\'s repetition of Paul Petrovitch\\'s\\nwords there echoed, this time, a note of pride.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch knit his brows.\\n\\n\"So, so!\" he said in a voice that was curiously calm. \"Nihilism\\nis designed to combat our every ill, and you alone are to act as\\nour saviours and our heroes! Well, well! But in what consider you\\nyourselves and your censorious friends to excel the rest of us? For you\\nchatter as much as does every one else.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" muttered Bazarov. \"At least we are not guilty of _that_,\\nhowever we may err in other ways.\"\\n\\n\"You do things, then? At all events, you are preparing to do things?\"\\n\\nBazarov did not reply, although, in his excitement, Paul Petrovitch had\\nstarted up and then quickly recovered his self-command.\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" continued Paul Petrovitch. \"With you to act is to demolish.\\nBut how is such demolition to benefit when you do not even know its\\npurpose?\"\\n\\n\"We demolish because we are a force,\" interposed Arkady.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch stared--then smiled.\\n\\n\"And a force need render account to no one,\" added Arkady with a\\nself-conscious straightening of his form.\\n\\n\"Fool!\" gasped Paul Petrovitch. Evidently he could contain himself\\nno longer. \"Have you ever considered _what_ you are maintaining with\\nyour miserable creed? Even an angel would lose patience! \\'A force,\\'\\nforsooth! You might as well say that the wild Kalmuck, or the barbaric\\nMongol, represents a force. What boots such a force? Civilisation and\\nits fruits are what we value. And do not tell me that those fruits\\nare to be overlooked, seeing that even the meanest _barbouilleur_,[3]\\nthe meanest piano-player who ever earned five kopecks a night, is of\\nmore use to society than you. For men of that kind at least stand for\\nculture rather than for some rude, Mongolian propelling-power. Yes, you\\nmay look upon yourselves as \\'the coming race,\\' yet you are fit but to\\nsit in a Kalmuck shanty. \\'A force,\\' forsooth! Good and \\'forceful\\' sirs,\\nI beg to tell you that you number but four men and a boy, whereas those\\nothers number millions, and are folk of the kind who will not permit\\nsuch as _you_ to trample upon their sacred beliefs, but will first\\ntrample upon your worthy selves.\"\\n\\n\"Let them trample upon us,\" retorted Bazarov. \"We are more in number\\nthan you think.\"\\n\\n\"What? You really believe that you will succeed in inoculating the\\nnation as a whole?\"\\n\\n\"From a little candle,\" replied Bazarov, \"there arose, as you know, the\\nconflagration of Moscow.\"[4]\\n\\n\"A pride almost Satanic in its nature, and then banter! And thus you\\nwould seek to attract our youth, _thus_ you would attempt to win the\\ninexperienced hearts of our boys! For sitting beside you is one of\\nthose very boys, and he is absolutely worshipping you!\" (Upon this\\nArkady knit his brows, and averted his head a little.) \"Yes, the\\ncanker has spread far already. For instance, they tell me that in Rome\\nour artists decline to enter the Vatican, and look upon Raphael as\\nnext-door to a fool, just because he is an \\'authority\\'! Yet those very\\nartists are themselves so barren and impotent that their fancy cannot\\nrise above \\'Girls at Fountains,\\' and so forth, villainously executed!\\nAnd such artists you account fine fellows, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Like those artists,\" said Bazarov, \"I consider Raphael to be worth not\\na copper groat. And as for the artists themselves, I appraise them at\\nabout a similar sum.\"\\n\\n\"Bravo, bravo!\" cried Paul Petrovitch. \"Listen, O Arkady--listen to\\nthe way in which the young men of the present day ought to express\\nthemselves! Surely our youth will now rally to your side? For once upon\\na time they had to go to school, since they did not like to be taken\\nfor dunces, and therefore worked at their studies; but now they have\\nbut to say: \\'Everything in the world is rubbish,\\' and, behold! the\\ntrick is done. They consider that delightful--and naturally! In other\\nwords, the blockheads of former days are become the Nihilists of the\\npresent.\"\\n\\n\"Your self-sufficiency--I mean, your self-respect--is carrying you\\naway,\" Bazarov remarked nonchalantly (as for Arkady, his eyes had\\nflashed, and his whole form was quivering with indignation). \"But our\\ndispute has gone far enough. Let us end it. Whenever you may feel that\\nyou can point out to me a single institution in our family or our\\npublic life which does not call for complete and unsparing rejection, I\\nshall be pleased to accept your view.\"\\n\\n\"Of institutions of that kind I could cite you millions,\" exclaimed\\nPaul Petrovitch. \"For example, take the village commune.\"\\n\\nBazarov\\'s lips twisted themselves into a contemptuous smile.\\n\\n\"The village commune,\" said he, \"is a subject which you would do better\\nto discuss with your brother, since he is learning by experience the\\nmeaning of that commune, and of its circular guarantee, and of its\\nenforced sobriety and other contrivances.\"\\n\\n\"Take the family, then--yes, take the family, since at least among the\\npeasantry it is still a surviving institution.\"\\n\\n\"And that question, too, I should imagine were best not dissected by\\nyou in detail. But see here, Paul Petrovitch. Allow yourself a minimum\\nof two days to think over these things (you will need quite that amount\\nof time to do so); and cite to yourself in succession our various\\nsocial conditions, and give them your best attention. Meanwhile Arkady\\nand myself will go and----\"\\n\\n\"Go and make sport of everything, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"No, go and dissect frogs. Come, Arkady! _Au revoir_, gentlemen.\"\\n\\nAnd the two friends departed. Left alone, the brothers looked at one\\nanother.\\n\\n\"So,\" at last said Paul Petrovitch, \"you see the young men of the\\nday--you see our successors!\"\\n\\n\"Our successors--yes,\" re-echoed Nikolai Petrovitch despondently.\\nThroughout the conversation he had been sitting simply on pins and\\nneedles; throughout it he had dared do no more than throw an occasional\\npained glance at Arkady. \"My brother, there came to me just now a\\ncurious reminiscence. It was of a quarrel which once I had with my\\nmother. During the contest she raised a great outcry, and refused to\\nlisten to a single word I said; until at length I told her that for\\nher to understand me was impossible, seeing that she and I came of\\ndifferent generations. Of course this angered her yet more, but I\\nthought to myself: \\'What else could I do? The pill must have been a\\nbitter one, but it was necessary that she should swallow it.\\' And now\\n_our_ turn is come; now is it for _us_ to be told by our heirs that we\\ncome of a different generation from theirs, and must kindly swallow the\\npill.\"\\n\\n\"You are too magnanimous and retiring,\" expostulated Paul Petrovitch.\\n\"For my part, I feel sure that we are more in the right than these\\ntwo youngsters, even though we may express ourselves in old-fashioned\\nterms, and lack their daring self-sufficiency. Indeed, what a puffed-up\\ncrowd is the youth of to-day! Should you ask one of them whether he\\nwill take white wine or red, he will reply, in a bass voice, and with\\na face as though the whole universe were looking at him: \\'Red is my\\ncustomary rule.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Should you like some more tea?\" interrupted Thenichka, who had been\\npeeping through the doorway, but had not dared to enter during the\\nprogress of the dispute.\\n\\n\"No,\" was Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s reply as he rose to meet her. \"So you\\ncan order the _samovar_ to be removed.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, with a brief \"_Bon soir_,\" Paul Petrovitch betook himself to\\nhis study.\\n\\n\\n[1] Ludwig Büchner (1824-1899), German physician and materialist\\nphilosopher.\\n\\n[2] _i.e._ the census-taking of the serf population.\\n\\n[3] Scribbler.\\n\\n[4] In 1812.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later Nikolai Petrovitch sought his favourite arbour.\\nDespondent thoughts were thronging through his brain, for the rift\\nbetween himself and his son was only too evident. Also, he knew that\\nthat rift would widen from day to day. For nothing had he spent whole\\ndays, during those winters in St. Petersburg, in the perusal of modern\\nworks! For nothing had he listened to the young men\\'s discourses! For\\nnothing had he been delighted when he had been able to interpolate a\\nword into their tempestuous debates!\\n\\n\"My brother says that we are more in the right than they,\" he\\nreflected. \"And certainly I too can say without vanity that I believe\\nthese young fellows to stand at a greater distance from the truth than\\nourselves. Yet also I believe that they have in them something which\\nwe lack--something which gives them an advantage over us. What is that\\nsomething? Is it youth? No, it is not youth alone. Is it that there\\nhovers about them less of the _barin_ than hovers about ourselves?\\nPossibly!\"\\n\\nBending his head, he passed his hand over his face.\\n\\n\"Yet to reject poetry!\" he muttered. \"To fail to sympathise with art\\nand nature!\"\\n\\nAnd he gazed around as though he were trying to understand how any\\none could be out of sympathy with the natural world. Evening was just\\nclosing in, and the sun sinking behind a small aspen copse which,\\nsituated half a verst from the garden, was trailing long shadows over\\nthe motionless fields. Along the narrow, dark track beside the copse\\na peasant on a white pony was trotting; and though the pair were\\novershadowed by the trees, the rider was as clearly visible, even to a\\npatch on his shoulder, as the twinkling legs of his steed. Piercing\\nthe tangled aspens, the sun\\'s beams were bathing the trunks in so\\nbrilliant a glow that trunks and beams were one bright mass, and only\\nthe foliage on the boughs above formed a dusky blur against the lighter\\ntints of the flame-coloured sky. Overhead bats were whirling; the wind\\nhad sunk to rest; a few late-homing bees were buzzing somnolently,\\nsluggishly amid the lilac blossoms; and a pillared swarm of gnats was\\ndancing over a projecting bough.\\n\\n\"O God, how fair!\" was Nikolai\\'s involuntary thought as his lips\\nbreathed a favourite couplet.\\n\\nSuddenly he remembered Arkady and _Stoff und Kraft_; and though\\nhe continued to sit where he was, he quoted poetry no more, but\\nsurrendered his mind wholly to the play of his lonely, irregular,\\nmournful thoughts. At all times he was a man fond of dreaming; and\\nto this tendency his life in the country had added confirmation. To\\nthink of what only a short while ago he had been dreaming as he waited\\nfor his son on the post-house verandah! For since that hour a change\\nhad come about, and in the vague relations between himself and his\\nson there had dawned a more definite phase. Next, he saw before him\\nhis dead wife. Yet he saw her, not as she had appeared to him during\\nthe later years of her life--that is to say, as a kindly, thrifty\\n_châtelaine_--but as a young girl slim of figure and innocently\\ninquiring of eye. Yes, there flitted before his vision a picture only\\nof neatly plaited tresses falling over a childish neck. And he thought\\nof his first meeting with her when, as a student, he had encountered\\nher on the staircase leading to his suite of rooms. He remembered how,\\nhaving accidentally brushed against her, he had stopped to apologise,\\nbut had only succeeded in muttering \"Pardon, _monsieur_\"; where-upon\\nshe had bowed, and smiled, and fled as in sudden alarm--but only\\nto turn, the next moment, at the bend of the staircase, to look\\nswiftly back, and then, as swiftly, to blush, and assume a more demure\\ndemeanour. Ah, those first timid meetings, those half-spoken words,\\nthose bashful smiles, those alternate fits of rapture and despair, that\\ncourtship that was destined to be crowned with swooning joy! Whither\\nwas it all fled? True, she had become his wife, and had conferred upon\\nhim such happiness as falls to the lot of few men on earth; but ever\\nthe thought recurred to him, and recurred again: \"Why could those days\\nof sweetness not have lasted for ever, so that we might have lived a\\nlife which should never have known death?\"\\n\\nHe made no attempt to co-ordinate his thoughts. The predominant feeling\\nin his mind was that he would give worlds to be able to connect himself\\nwith those blessed days by something stronger than the mere power of\\nmemory. He wanted to feel his Maria near him once more, to scent her\\ndear breath. A curious mood had him in its grip.\\n\\n\"Nikolai Petrovitch!\" came the voice of Thenichka from a spot somewhere\\nin the vicinity. \"Where are you?\"\\n\\nAs he heard the call, a feeling that was neither vexation nor shame\\npassed over him. No comparison between his dead wife and Thenichka was\\npossible, yet he gave a start, and felt a passing regret that Thenichka\\nhad seized _that_ moment to seek him. For in some way did the sound\\nof her voice bring back to him his grey hairs, his old age, all that\\nconstituted the present. So for an instant the enchanted world which\\nhe had just entered, and which he had just seen emerge from the misty\\nwaves of the past, quivered--then disappeared.\\n\\n\"I am here, Thenichka,\" he called. \"Please go away. I will come\\npresently.\"\\n\\n\"Another reminder that I am a _barin_,\" he reflected.\\n\\nThenichka retired, and suddenly he became aware of the fact that since\\nthe moment when he had sunk into a reverie nightfall had come. Yes,\\nall around him there lay a motionless obscurity, with, gleaming amid\\nit, as a small, pale blur, Thenichka\\'s face. Rising, he started to\\nreturn to the house, but his unstrung nerves could not calm themselves,\\nand, glancing now at the ground, now towards the heavens where there\\nswarmed myriads of twinkling stars, he fell to pacing the garden. He\\ncontinued this pacing until he was almost worn out; for still did the\\nvague, despondent, insistent sense of agitation refuse to leave his\\nbreast. Could Bazarov have divined his thoughts, how the Nihilist would\\nhave laughed! And even Arkady would have condemned him. For from the\\neyes of Nikolai Petrovitch--from the eyes of a man of forty-four who\\nwas the proprietor of an estate and a household--there were welling\\nslow, uncalled-for tears. This was a hundred times worse than the\\n\\'cello-playing!\\n\\nAnd still he continued his pacing, for he could not make up his mind\\nto enter the peaceful, inviting retreat which beckoned to him so\\ncheerfully with its lighted windows, and to leave the darkness of the\\ngarden, to forego the touch of fresh air upon his face, to throw off\\nhis present mood of sadness and emotion.\\n\\nAt a turn in the path he encountered Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"What is the matter with you?\" Paul inquired. \"You are looking as white\\nas a ghost. Are you ill? Why not go to bed?\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch explained to him in a few words his frame of\\nmind--then moved towards the house. Paul Petrovitch sauntered down\\ntowards the other end of the garden, and ever and anon, as he did so,\\nindulged in wrapt contemplation of the heavens. Yet, save for the\\nreflection of the starlight, there was nothing to be seen in his dark,\\nhandsome eyes; for he had not been born a Romanticist, and his drily\\nfastidious, passionate, Frenchified, misanthropic soul was incapable\\nof castle-building.\\n\\n\"I tell you what,\" Bazarov said to Arkady the same night. \"A splendid\\nidea has come into my head. You know that to-day your father said that\\na certain eminent relation had sent him an invitation which he had no\\nintention of accepting. Well, how would it be if you and I were to\\naccept it, seeing that you too have been included in the honour? The\\nweather has turned beautiful, and we might drive over and look at the\\ntown, and thus, incidentally, secure a few days\\' uninterrupted talk\\ntogether.\"\\n\\n\"Should you then return here?\"\\n\\n\"No. I should go on to my father\\'s. You see, he lives thirty versts\\naway only, and it is a long time since last I saw either him or my\\nmother. Moreover, the old folk deserve to be humoured a little, seeing\\nthat they have been very good to me--especially my father--and that I\\nam their only son.\"\\n\\n\"And shall you stay long?\"\\n\\n\"No. Staying in that place is dull work.\"\\n\\n\"Then pay us a second visit on your way back?\"\\n\\n\"I will if possible. We will go, then, eh?\"\\n\\n\"At your pleasure,\" Arkady replied with a show of indifference. But, as\\na matter of fact, he was delighted with Bazarov\\'s proposal; and only\\nthe thought that he must keep up his \"Nihilism\" prevented him from\\nmanifesting his feelings.\\n\\nSo, the next day, the pair set out for the town of ----; while with one\\nconsent the youth of Marino broke into lamentations over their going,\\nand Duniasha even went so far as to weep. Only their elders breathed\\nmore freely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\\nThe town of ----, whither our friends now proceeded, lay under the\\ndominion of one of those young, progressive, despotic provincial\\ngovernors who afflict Russia in an unending sequence. As early as the\\nfirst year of his rule this particular potentate had succeeded in\\nquarrelling, not only with the President of the Provincial Council (who\\nwas a retired staff officer, a horse breeder, and an agriculturist),\\nbut also with his whole gubernatorial staff of _tchinovniks_: with\\nthe result that at the time of our story the commotion therefrom had\\nattained a pitch which had just necessitated the sending down of\\na commissary empowered to hold an investigation. The Government\\'s\\nchoice for this purpose had fallen upon Matvei Ilyitch Koliazin, the\\nson of the Koliazin who had once acted as guardian to the brothers\\nKirsanov, and a man of the younger school--that is to say, a man who,\\nthough a little over forty, still aimed at attaining the dignity of a\\nstatesman, and having a breast covered with stars (including at least\\none of a foreign minor order), and who, also like the Governor whom\\nhe had come to examine, was accounted a Progressive, and held a high\\nopinion of himself. Yet never did Matvei allow his boundless vanity\\nto prevent him from affecting a stereotyped air of simplicity and\\ngood humour, or from listening indulgently to anything that might be\\nsaid to him, or from cultivating so pleasant a laugh that everywhere\\nhe contrived to pass for \"not a bad sort of a fellow.\" True, he could\\non important occasions (if I may quote the trite saying) \"make dust\\nfly\" (\"Energy is indispensable for a State worker,\" was a frequent saw\\nof his--\"_L\\'énergie est la première qualité d\\'un homme d\\'état_\");\\nyet almost invariably did he end by being set down as a fool, while\\n_tchinovniks_ of more experience rode roughshod over him. Amongst other\\nthings, he had a custom of expressing a great respect for Guizot,[1]\\nand also of striving to convince every one that he (Koliazin) was not\\none of \"your men of routine, your retired bureaucrats,\" but, rather, a\\nman who noted \"every new and more important phenomenon of our social\\nlife.\" In fact, such phrases he had at his finger ends, and also he\\nstudied (though with a sort of careless pomposity only) the development\\nof contemporary literature. Lastly, it not seldom befell that, on\\nmeeting a street procession of students, he would, though maturer of\\nyears than the majority of its members, add himself to its ranks. In\\nshort, only his circumstances and his epoch caused Matvei Ilyitch in\\nany way to differ from those officials of the Alexandrine period who,\\nbefore setting out to attend a reception at Madame Svietchin\\'s[2] (then\\nresident in St. Petersburg), would read a few pages of Condillac\\'s[3]\\nworks. Yet, though an adroit courtier, Matvei was a mere glittering\\nfraud, since, save that he knew how to hold his own against all comers\\n(though, certainly, that is a great achievement in life), he was, in\\nall matters of State, a complete stranger to common sense.\\n\\nOn the present occasion he welcomed Arkady with all the _bonhomie_,\\nall the jocosity, of an \"enlightened\" bigwig. Nevertheless his face\\nfell a little when he learned that the other relatives whom he had\\ninvited had preferred remaining in the country. \"Your father always\\nwas a queer fish,\" he remarked as he parted the tails of a velvet\\n\"cutaway.\" And, having said this, he turned to a young _tchinovnik_ in\\na tightly buttoned uniform, and asked him irritably what he wanted;\\nat which onslaught the young _tchinovnik_ (whose lips looked as\\nthough a confirmed habit of keeping their own counsel had gummed them\\npermanently together) straightened himself with a sharp, apprehensive\\nlook at his superior. But, once Matvei had effected this \"settling\" of\\nhis subordinate, the great man paid the little one no further attention.\\n\\nIn passing, I may observe that to most of our bigwigs is this species\\nof \"settling\" very dear, and that many are the expedients resorted\\nto for its achievement. Particularly is the following method \"quite\\na favourite,\" as the English say--in other words, much in request.\\nSuddenly a given bigwig will cease to be able to grasp with his\\nintelligence even the simplest sentence, and assume an air of abysmal\\ndensity. For example, he will inquire what the day of the week may be,\\nand be told (with great and stammering deference) that the day is, say,\\nFriday.\\n\\n\"What?\" will roar the bigwig with an air of being forced to strain his\\nears to the utmost. \"Eh? what do you say?\"\\n\\n\"I-It is F-Friday, your E-E-Excellency.\"\\n\\n\"Eh, what? Friday? What mean you by Friday?\"\\n\\n\"Y-Your Excellency, F-Friday is, is--F-F-Friday is a day in the week.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come! You need not have taken so much time to tell me _that_.\"\\n\\nMatvei Ilyitch was just such a bigwig, although he called himself a\\nLiberal.\\n\\n\"My good fellow,\" he now continued to Arkady, \"I should advise you to\\ngo and leave your card upon the Governor. Of course you understand that\\nmy reason for counselling you to adopt this procedure is, not that I\\nin any way hold with any bygone ideas about kow-towing to authority,\\nbut, rather, because the Governor is a good fellow, and I know that you\\nwould like to see a little society. For you too are not a bear, I hope?\\nNo? Well, the Governor is giving a grand ball the day after to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"And shall you be there?\" asked Arkady.\\n\\n\"I shall, of course, receive tickets for it,\" replied Matvei Ilyitch\\nwith an assumed air of regret. \"You dance, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"I do--though very badly.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, never mind. There exists here plenty of good society, and\\nit would never do for a young fellow like yourself to be a non-dancer.\\nAgain I say this, not because I in any way revere antiquated notions,\\nnor yet because I think that intellect ought to go kicking its heels\\nabout, but because Byronism has become absurd--_il a fait son temps_.\"\\n\\n\"But I belong to neither the Byronists nor----\"\\n\\n\"Well, well! I will introduce you to some of our ladies--I myself will\\ntake you under my wing.\" And Matvei Ilyitch smiled in a self-satisfied\\nway. \"In fact, you shall have a gay time here.\"\\n\\nAt this point a servant entered to announce the President of the\\nProvincial Treasury. The latter, a mild-eyed veteran with wrinkles\\naround his lips and a great love for nature, was accustomed to remark\\non summer days that \"of every little flower each little bee is now\\ntaking its toll.\" So Arkady seized the occasion to depart.\\n\\nHe found Bazarov at the hotel where the pair were putting up, and had\\ngreat difficulty in persuading him to join in the projected call upon\\nthe Governor.\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" eventually said Bazarov. \"I have laid a hand upon the\\ntow-rope, so it ill becomes me to complain of its weight. As we are\\nhere to inspect the local lions, let us inspect them.\"\\n\\nTo the young men the Governor accorded a civil enough welcome, but\\nneither bade them be seated nor set the example himself. A man in\\na perpetual hurry and ferment, he, on rising in the morning, was\\naccustomed to don a tight uniform and stiff collar, and then to give\\nhimself up to such an orgy of orders-giving that he never finished\\na single meal. As the result, he was known throughout the province\\nas \"Bardeloue\"--in reference, be it said, not to the great French\\npreacher,[4] but to _burda_, fermented liquor. After inviting Arkady\\nand Bazarov to the coming ball, the Governor, two minutes later,\\nrepeated the invitation as though he had never given it; while likewise\\nhe mistook the pair for brothers, and addressed them throughout as \"the\\nMessieurs _Kaiserov_.\"\\n\\nSubsequently, as the pair were proceeding homewards, a man of small\\nstature, and dressed in a \"Slavophil\" costume, leapt from a passing\\n_drozhki_, and, with a cry of \"Evgenii Vasilitch!\" flung himself upon\\nBazarov.\\n\\n\"Is that you, Herr Sitnikov?\" remarked Bazarov without even checking\\nhis stride. \"What chance brings you hither?\"\\n\\n\"A pure accident,\" was the other\\'s reply as, turning to the _drozhki_,\\nhe signed to the coachman to follow at a foot\\'s pace. \"You see, I had\\nbusiness to do with my father, and he invited me to pay him a visit.\"\\nSitnikov hopped across a puddle. \"Also, on learning of your arrival,\\nI have been to call at your place.\" (True enough, on subsequently\\nreaching the hotel, the two friends found awaiting them Sitnikov\\'s\\nvisiting-card, with the corners turned down, and one side of it\\ninscribed with his name in the French fashion, and the other with his\\nname in Slavonic characters.)\\n\\n\"You are from the Governor\\'s, I suppose?\" continued the little man. \"I\\nsincerely hope not, however.\"\\n\\n\"Your hopes are vain.\"\\n\\n\"Then I too, alas, must pay him my _devoirs_. But first introduce me to\\nyour friend.\"\\n\\n\"Sitnikov--Kirsanov,\" responded Bazarov without halting.\\n\\n\"Delighted!\" minced Sitnikov as he stepped back, struck an attitude,\\nand hurriedly doffed his super-elegant gloves. \"I have heard much of\\nyou, Monsieur Kirsanov. I too am an old acquaintance--I might even say,\\nan old pupil--of Evgenii Vasilitch\\'s. Through him it was that I came by\\nmy spiritual regeneration.\"\\n\\nArkady glanced at Bazarov\\'s \"old pupil,\" and saw that he had small,\\ndull, pleasant, nervous features; also that his narrow, sunken eyes\\nexpressed a great restlessness, and that his lips were parted in a\\nperpetual smile of a wooden and ingratiating order.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" Sitnikov continued, \"when Evgenii Vasilitch first told\\nme that we ought to ignore every species of authority I experienced\\na sense of rapture, I felt as though I had suddenly ripened. \\'Ah,\\' I\\nthought, \\'at last have I found my man!\\' By the way, Evgenii Vasilitch,\\nyou _must_ come and see a certain lady of my acquaintance--one who,\\nbeyond all others, is the person to understand you, and to look upon\\nyour coming as a red-letter event. Perhaps you have heard of her\\nalready?\"\\n\\n\"No. Who is she?\" asked Bazarov reluctantly.\\n\\n\"A Madame Kukshin--a Madame, I should say, _Evdoksia_ Kukshin. And she\\nis not merely a remarkable character and a woman of light and leading;\\nshe is also representative of the _émancipée_, in the best sense of the\\nword. But look here. How would it be if all three of us were to go and\\nsee her? She lives only two steps away, and she would give us luncheon.\\nYou have not lunched already, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"No, we have not.\"\\n\\n\"Then the arrangement would suit us all. By the way, she is\\nindependent, but a married woman.\"\\n\\n\"Good-looking?\" queried Bazarov.\\n\\n\"N-No--one could not exactly say that.\"\\n\\n\"Then why ask us to go and see her?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, ha! You _will_ have your jest, I see. But remember that she will\\nstand us a bottle of champagne.\"\\n\\n\"The practicality of the man!\"\\n\\nSitnikov gave a shrill giggle.\\n\\n\"Shall we go?\" he added.\\n\\n\"I cannot decide.\"\\n\\nHere Arkady put in a word.\\n\\n\"We have come to inspect the local people,\" he remarked, \"so let us\\ninspect them.\"\\n\\n\"True enough,\" seconded Sitnikov. \"And, of course, _you_ must come,\\nMonsieur Kirsanov. We could not go without you.\"\\n\\n\"What? Are all three of us to descend upon her?\"\\n\\n\"What matter? She herself is an odd person.\"\\n\\n\"And you say that she will stand us a bottle of champagne.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; or even a bottle apiece,\" asserted Sitnikov. \"I will go bail upon\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\"Go bail with what?\"\\n\\n\"With my head.\"\\n\\n\"Your purse would have been better; but lead on.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] François Pierre Guillaume Guizot (1787-1874), the great French\\nminister, ambassador, _littérateur_, and educationalist.\\n\\n[2] Madame Svietchin (1782-1857), wife of the Russian General\\nSvietchin. For more than forty years she maintained a famous salon.\\n\\n[3] Etienne Bonnot de Mably de Condillac (1715-1780), a French\\nphilosopher who based knowledge solely upon the physical senses.\\n\\n[4] Louis Bourdaloue (1632-1704), a professor in the Jesuit College of\\nBourges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\n\\nThe villa in which Avdotia, or Evdoksia, Nikitishna Kukshin resided\\nwas one of the usual Moscow pattern, and stood in one of the recently\\nconsumed streets (for as we know, every fifth year sees each of our\\nprovincial capitals burnt to the ground) of the town of ----. Beside\\nthe front door there hung (over a cracked, crooked visiting-card)\\na bell-handle, while in the hall the visitors were met by a female\\nwho constituted, not exactly a maidservant, but a mob-capped \"lady\\ncompanion.\" And it need hardly be added that these two phenomena, the\\nbell-handle and the \"lady companion,\" constituted clear evidence of the\\n\"progressiveness\" of the hostess\\'s views.\\n\\nOn Sitnikov inquiring whether Avdotia Nikitishna were within, a shrill\\nvoice interrupted him from an adjoining room:\\n\\n\"Is that you, Victor? Pray enter.\"\\n\\nThe female in the mob-cap disappeared.\\n\\n\"I have not come alone,\" Sitnikov responded as, after an inquiring\\nglance at Arkady and Bazarov, he divested himself of his greatcoat, and\\nrevealed thereunder a sort of sack jacket.\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" the voice replied. \"_Entrez, s\\'il vous plaît._\"\\n\\nThe young men did as bidden, and found themselves in a room which\\nresembled a workshop rather than a parlour. On tables were piled\\npromiscuous papers, letters and Russian magazines (most of the\\nlatter uncut); everywhere on the floor were to be seen gleaming the\\nfag-ends of cigarettes; and on a leather-padded sofa a lady--youngish,\\nflaxen-haired, and clad in a _négligée_ soiled silk gown--was lolling\\nin a semi-recumbent position. About her stumpy wrists were clasped a\\nlarge pair of bracelets, and over her head was thrown a lace mantilla.\\nRising, she draped her shoulders carelessly in a velvet tippet with\\nfaded ermine trimming, and, saying indolently, \"Good day, Victor,\"\\npressed Sitnikov\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Bazarov--Kirsanov,\" he said in abrupt imitation of the former;\\nwhereupon she responded, \"How do you do?\" and then added, as she\\nfixed upon Bazarov a pair of large eyes between which glimmered a\\ncorrespondingly small, pink, upturned nose: \"I have met you before.\"\\n\\nThat said, she pressed his hand even as she had done Sitnikov\\'s.\\n\\nBazarov frowned, for though the plain, insignificant features of\\nthe emancipated lady contained nothing actually to repel, there was\\nsomething in their mien which produced upon the beholder the sort of\\nunpleasant impression which might have inclined him to ask her: \"Are\\nyou hungry, or bored, or afraid? At all events, what is it you want?\"\\nAlso, like Sitnikov, she kept pawing the air as she spoke, and her\\nevery word, her every gesture, revealed such a lack of control as at\\ntimes amounted to sheer awkwardness. In short, though she conceived\\nherself to be just a simple, good-hearted creature, her bearing was of\\nthe kind to lead the beholder to reflect that, no matter what she did,\\nit was not what she had intended to do, and that everything was done\\n(to use the children\\'s term) \"on purpose\"--that is to say, non-simply\\nand non-naturally.\\n\\n\"Yes, I have met you before, Bazarov,\" she repeated (like many other\\ncontemporary females of Moscow and the provinces, she had adopted the\\nfashion of calling men by their surnames alone on first introduction).\\n\"Will you have a cigar?\"\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" interposed Sitnikov (who had deposited his person in an\\narmchair, and crossed his legs). \"Also, pray give us some luncheon,\\nfor we are absolutely ravenous. Also, you might order us a bottle of\\nchampagne.\"\\n\\n\"You Sybarite!\" exclaimed Evdoksia with a smile (a smile always brought\\nher upper gum prominently into view). \"Is he not, Bazarov?\"\\n\\n\"No; it is merely that I love the comforts of life,\" protested Sitnikov\\npompously. \"Nor need that in any way prevent me from being a Liberal.\"\\n\\n\"But it does, it does,\" cried Evdoksia. However, she gave orders to\\nher servant to see both to the luncheon and to the champagne. \"What is\\n_your_ opinion on the matter?\" she added, turning to Bazarov. \"I feel\\nconvinced that you share mine.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not,\" he replied. \"On the contrary, I think that, even from\\nthe chemical point of view, a piece of meat is better than a piece of\\nbread.\"\\n\\n\"Then you study chemistry?\" she exclaimed. \"Chemistry is _my_ passion\\nalso. In fact, I have invented a special liniment.\"\\n\\n\"A liniment? You?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I. And please guess its use. It is for making unbreakable dolls\\nand pipe-bowls. You see that, like yourself, I am of a practical turn\\nof mind. But, as yet, I have not completed my course of study. It\\nstill remains for me to read up my Liebig. _Apropos_, have you seen an\\narticle in the _Viedomosti_ on Woman\\'s Work--an article by Kisliakov?\\nIf not, you should read it (for I presume that you take an interest in\\nthe Feminine Question, and also in the Question of the Schools?). But\\nwhat is your friend\\'s line? _Apropos_, what is his name?\"\\n\\nThese questions Madame Kukshin, as it were, mouthed, and did so with an\\naffected carelessness which waited for no reply, even as a spoilt child\\npropounds conundrums to its nurse.\\n\\n\"My name is Arkady Nikolaievitch Kirsanov,\" Arkady answered for\\nhimself. \"And my particular line is doing nothing at all.\"\\n\\nEvdoksia tittered.\\n\\n\"How nice!\" she exclaimed. \"Then you do not even smoke? Victor, I am\\nfurious with you!\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" enquired Sitnikov.\\n\\n\"Because I have just heard that you are again standing up for Georges\\nSand, that played-out woman. How is she even to be compared (that\\ncreature, who lacks a single idea on education or physiology or\\nanything else) with Emerson? In fact, I believe that never in her life\\nhas she so much as _heard_ of embryology--though in these days no one\\ncan get on without it.\" The speaker flung out her arms in an expressive\\ngesture. \"But what a splendid article was that of Elisievitch\\'s!\\nHe is indeed a talented gentleman!\" (This was another habit of\\nEvdoksia\\'s--the habit of persistently using the term \"gentleman\" for\\nthe ordinary word \"man\"). \"Bazarov, pray come and sit beside me on the\\nsofa. You may not know it, but I am dreadfully afraid of you.\"\\n\\n\"Why are you afraid of me (if you will forgive my curiosity)?\"\\n\\n\"Because you are a dangerous gentleman--you are a critic so caustic\\nthat in your presence my confusion leads me to begin speaking like\\na lady-landowner of the Steppes. _Apropos_, I am a lady-landowner\\nmyself; for, though I employ a local steward named Erothei (a sort of\\nCooper\\'s \\'Pathfinder,\\' but compounded with a blend of independence in\\nhis composition), I retain the ultimate reins of management in my own\\nhands. But how unbearable this town is!--yes, even though I have made\\nit my permanent home, seeing that nothing else was to be done!\"\\n\\n\"The town is what a town always is,\" remarked Bazarov indifferently.\\n\\n\"But its interests are so petty!\" continued Evdoksia.\\n\\n\"_That_ is what troubles me. Once upon a time I used to winter in\\nMoscow, but now good Monsieur Kukshin has to dwell there alone. And\\nMoscow itself is, is--well, not what it used to be. As a matter of\\nfact, I contemplate going abroad. I have spent the whole year in making\\nmy preparations for the journey.\"\\n\\n\"You will go to Paris, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and to Heidelberg.\"\\n\\n\"Why to Heidelberg?\"\\n\\n\"Because there the great Herr Bunsen[1] has his home.\"\\n\\nBazarov could not think of a suitable reply.\\n\\n\"Do you know Pierre Sapozhnikov?\" continued she.\\n\\n\"No, I do not.\"\\n\\n\"He is always to be found at Lydia Khostatov\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Even with her I am not acquainted.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Sapozhnikov is going to escort me on my travels. For at least I\\nam free--I have no children, thank God! Why I should have put in that\\n\\'Thank God!\\' I scarcely know.\"\\n\\nShe rolled another cigarette between her nicotine-stained fingers,\\nlicked it, placed it between her lips, and struck a match. The servant\\nentered with a tray.\\n\\n\"Ah! Here comes luncheon! Will you have some? Victor, pray uncork the\\nbottle. It is your function to do so.\"\\n\\n\"Mine, yes, mine,\" he hummed; then gave another of his shrill giggles.\\n\\n\"Have you any good-looking ladies in this town?\" Bazarov asked after a\\nthird glassful of champagne.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Evdoksia. \"But uniformly they are futile. For example, a\\nfriend of mine, a Madame Odintsov, is not bad-looking, and has nothing\\nagainst her except a doubtful reputation (a thing of no consequence\\nin itself); but, alas! she combines with it such a complete lack of\\nfreedom, or of breadth of view, or, in fact, of anything! The system\\nof bringing up women needs a radical change. I myself have given much\\nthought to the matter, and come to the conclusion that our women are\\nill-educated.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; the only thing to be done with them is to hold them in contempt,\"\\nagreed Sitnikov. To him any opportunity of despising, of expressing\\nscornful sentiments, was the most agreeable of sensations. Yet, though\\nhe thus chose women for his especial censure, he little suspected that\\nbefore many months were over he himself would be grovelling at the feet\\nof a wife--and doing so merely for the reason that she had been born a\\nPrincess Durdoleosov!\\n\\n\"No, to none of them would our conversation convey anything,\" he\\ncontinued. \"Nor is there a single one of them upon whom the attention\\nof a serious-minded man would be anything but thrown away.\"\\n\\n\"Scarcely need they _desire_ to have anything conveyed to them by our\\nconversation,\" remarked Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Of whom are you speaking?\" interposed Evdoksia.\\n\\n\"Of the smart women of the day.\"\\n\\n\"What? I suppose you agree with Proudhon\\'s[2] opinion on the subject?\"\\n\\nBazarov drew himself up.\\n\\n\"I agree with no man\\'s opinions,\" he remarked. \"I have some of my own.\"\\n\\n\"_A bas les autorités!_\" cried Sitnikov, delighted at this unlooked-for\\nopportunity of showing off in the presence of the man whom he\\nworshipped.\\n\\n\"But even Macaulay----\" began Madame Kukshin.\\n\\n\"_A bas_ Macaulay!\" roared Sitnikov. \"How can you defend those dolls of\\nours?\"\\n\\n\"I am not defending them at all,\" said Madame Kukshin. \"I am merely\\nstanding up for the rights of women--rights which I have sworn to\\ndefend to the last drop of my blood.\"\\n\\n\"_A bas_----\" began Sitnikov--then paused. \"I do not reject them,\" he\\nadded in a lower tone.\\n\\n\"But you _do_ reject them, for you are a Slavophil, as I can see very\\nclearly.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, I am _not_ a Slavophil; although, of course, I----\"\\n\\n\"But you _are_ a Slavophil: you believe in the principles of the\\n_Domostroi_,[3] and would like always to be holding over women a\\nscourge.\"\\n\\n\"A scourge is not a bad thing in its proper place,\" observed Bazarov.\\n\"But, seeing that we have reached the last drop of, of----\"\\n\\n\"Of what?\" said Evdoksia.\\n\\n\"Of champagne, most respected Avdotia Nikitishna--not of your blood.\"\\n\\n\"Never when I hear my sex abused can I listen with indifference,\"\\nresumed Evdoksia. \"It is all too horrible, too horrible! Instead of\\nattacking us, people ought to read Michel\\'s[4] _De l\\'Amour_. What a\\nwonderful work it is! Let us talk of love.\"\\n\\nShe posed her arm gracefully upon the tumbled cushions of the sofa.\\n\\nThere fell a sudden silence.\\n\\n\"What is there to say concerning love?\" at length said Bazarov. \"In\\npassing, you mentioned a certain Madame Odintsov (I think that was the\\nname?). Who is she?\"\\n\\n\"A very charming woman,\" squeaked Sitnikov, \"as well as clever, rich,\\nand a widow. Unfortunately, she is not sufficiently _developed_, and\\na closer acquaintance with our Evdoksia would do her a world of good.\\nEvdoksia, I drink to your health! Let us sing the honours. \\'Et toc, et\\ntoc, et tin, tin, tin! Et toc, et toc, et tin, tin, tin!\\'\"\\n\\n\"You scamp, Victor!\"\\n\\nThe luncheon proved a lengthy affair, for to the first bottle of\\nchampagne there succeeded a second, and to the latter a third, and to\\nthat a fourth. Meanwhile Evdoksia kept up an unceasing flow of chatter,\\nand received effective assistance from Sitnikov. In particular did\\nthe pair discuss the nature of marriage (\"the outcome of prejudice\\nand vice\"), the question whether people are born \"single,\" and the\\nconsistency of \"individuality.\" Then Evdoksia seated herself at the\\npiano, and, red in the face with wine which she had drunk, clattered\\nher flat finger-nails upon the keys, and essayed hoarsely to sing,\\nfirst of all some gipsy ditties, and then the ballad, \"Dreaming Granada\\nlies asleep\"; while, throwing a scarf over his head to represent the\\ndying lover, Sitnikov joined her at the words \"Your lips meet mine in a\\nburning kiss.\"\\n\\nAt length Arkady could stand it no longer.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he exclaimed, \"this is sheer Bedlam!\"\\n\\nAs for Bazarov, he yawned, for he had done little more than interject\\na satirical word or two--his attention had been devoted, rather, to\\nthe champagne. At length he rose, and, accompanied by Arkady, left the\\nhouse without so much as a word of farewell to the hostess. Sitnikov\\npursued the pair.\\n\\n\"Ah, ha!\" he exclaimed as he skipped about the roadway. \"Did I not tell\\nyou that she would prove a most remarkable personality? Would that more\\nof our women were like her! In her way, she is a moral phenomenon.\"\\n\\n\"And your father\\'s establishment?\" remarked Bazarov as he pointed\\nto a tavern which they happened to be passing. \"Is that also a moral\\nphenomenon?\"\\n\\nSitnikov vented another of his shrill giggles. But, being also ashamed\\nof his origin, he felt at a loss whether to plume himself upon, or to\\ntake offence at, Bazarov\\'s unexpected pleasantry.\\n\\n\\n[1] Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (1811-1899), chemist and physicist; inventor\\nof Bunsen\\'s burner and magnesium light; and originator (with Kirchhov)\\nof spectrum analysis.\\n\\n[2] Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865), a French doctrinaire who taught\\nthat anarchy is the culmination of all social progress.\\n\\n[3] A curious old sixteenth-century work which, usually attributed to\\nthe monk Sylvester, purports to be a \"guide to household management,\"\\nand, incidentally, gives a terrible picture of the power of the Russian\\nhusband over his wife.\\n\\n[4] Louise Michel (1830-1906), a French anarchist long resident in\\nLondon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\n\\nA few days later, the ball was held at the Governor\\'s, and Matvei\\nIlyitch figured thereat as the guest of honour. For his part, the\\nPresident of the Provincial Council (who was at loggerheads with the\\nGovernor) explained at large that only out of respect for Matvei had\\nhe deigned to be present, while the Governor continued, even when\\nstationary, his usual process of orders-giving. With Matvei\\'s suavity\\nof demeanour nothing could be compared save his pomposity. Upon every\\nman he smiled--upon some with a hint of superciliousness, upon others\\nwith a shade of deference; whilst to the ladies he bowed and scraped\\n_en vrai chevalier français_, and laughed, throughout, the great,\\nresonant, conspicuous laugh which a bigwig ought to do. Again, he\\nclapped Arkady upon the back, addressed him loudly as \"young nephew,\"\\nand honoured Bazarov (who had been with difficulty coaxed into an\\nancient tail-coat) both with a distant, yet faintly condescending,\\nglance which skimmed that individual\\'s cheek, and with a vague,\\nbut affable, murmur in which there could be distinguished only the\\nfragments \"I,\" \"Yes,\" and \"\\'xtremely.\" Lastly, he accorded Sitnikov\\na finger and a smile (in the very act, turning his head away), and\\nbestowed upon Madame Kukshin (who had appeared minus a crinoline and\\nin dirty gloves, but with a bird of paradise stuck in her hair) an\\n\"_Enchanté_!\" The throng present was immense; nor was a sufficiency\\nof cavaliers lacking. True, most of the civilian element crowded\\nagainst the walls, but the military section danced with enthusiasm,\\nespecially an officer who, being fresh from six weeks in Paris, where\\nhe had become acquainted with daring cries of the type of \"Zut!\"\\n\"Ah, fichtrrre!\" \"Pst, pst, mon bibi!\" and so forth, pronounced these\\nquips to perfection, with true Parisian _chic_; while also he said\\n\"_Si j\\'aurais_\" for \"_Si j\\'avais_,\" and \"_absolument_\" in the sense of\\n\"certainly.\" In short, he employed that Franco-Russian jargon which\\naffords the French such intense amusement whenever they do not think it\\nmore prudent to assure their Russian friends that the latter speak the\\ntongue of France _comme des anges_.\\n\\nAs we know, Arkady was a poor dancer, and Bazarov did not dance at all;\\nwherefore the pair sought a corner, and were there joined by Sitnikov.\\nSummoning to his visage his accustomed smile of contempt, and emitting\\nremarks mordantly sarcastic in their nature, the great Sitnikov glanced\\nhaughtily about him, and appeared to derive some genuine pleasure from\\nthus striking an attitude. But suddenly his face underwent a change.\\nTurning to Arkady, he said in a self-conscious way: \"Here is Madame\\nOdintsov just entering.\"\\n\\nLooking up, Arkady beheld, halted in the doorway, a tall woman in\\na black gown. In particular was he struck with the dignity of her\\ncarriage, and with the manner in which her bare arms hung beside\\nher upright figure. From her gleaming hair to her sloping shoulders\\ntrailed sprays of fuchsia flowers, while quietly, intelligently--I say\\n_quietly_, not dreamily--there gazed, with a barely perceptible smile,\\nfrom under a white and slightly prominent forehead a pair of brilliant\\neyes. In general, the countenance suggested latent, but gentle, kindly\\nforce.\\n\\n\"Do you know her?\" Arkady inquired.\\n\\n\"I do--intimately,\" replied Sitnikov. \"Shall I introduce you?\"\\n\\n\"If you please; but only when this quadrille has come to an end.\"\\n\\nBazarov\\'s attention also had been caught by this Madame Odintsov.\\n\\n\"What a face!\" he exclaimed. \"No other woman in the room has one\\nanything like it.\"\\n\\nAs soon, therefore, as the quadrille was over, Sitnikov conducted\\nArkady to Madame Odintsov; and though at first--whether through the\\nexcessive \"intimacy\" of Sitnikov\\'s acquaintance, or whether through the\\nfact that he happened to stumble over his words--she gazed at him with\\na shade of astonishment, she no sooner heard Arkady\\'s family name than\\nher face brightened, and she inquired whether he was the son of Nikolai\\nPetrovitch.\\n\\n\"I am,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\n\"Then I have twice had the pleasure of meeting your father. Also, I\\nhave heard much about him, and shall be most glad to know you.\"\\n\\nAt this point an aide-de-camp sidled up, and requested the honour of a\\nquadrille: which request she granted.\\n\\n\"Then you dance?\" exclaimed Arkady, but with great deference.\\n\\n\"I do. What made you think that I do not? Is it that I look too old?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, pardon me! By no means! Then perhaps I too might ask for a\\nmazurka?\"\\n\\nSmiling indulgently, she replied, \"If you wish,\" and then looked at him\\nnot so much in a \"superior\" manner as in that of a married sister who\\nis regarding a very, very young brother. Though she was not greatly\\nolder than Arkady (she had just attained her twenty-ninth year), her\\npresence made him feel the veriest schoolboy, and caused the difference\\nof years to seem infinitely greater than it was. Next, Matvei Ilyitch\\napproached her with a majestic air and a few obsequious words;\\nwhereupon Arkady moved away a little, while continuing to observe her.\\nIn fact, not until the quadrille was over did he find himself able\\nto withdraw his eyes from her bewitching person. Throughout, her\\nconversation with her partner and the guest of honour was accompanied\\nwith small movements of the head and eyes, and twice she uttered a\\nlow laugh. True, her nose erred a little on the side of thickness\\n(as do those of most Russian women), nor was the colour of her skin\\nunimpeachable; yet Arkady came to the conclusion that never in his life\\nhad he encountered a woman so charming of personality. Continuously\\nthe sound of her voice murmured in his ears, and the very folds of her\\ndress looked different from those of other women--they seemed to hang\\nstraighter and more symmetrically, and her every movement was smooth\\nand natural.\\n\\nNevertheless, when the strains of the mazurka struck up, and, reseating\\nhimself beside his partner, he prepared to enter into conversation\\nwith her, he felt a distinct touch of diffidence. Nor, though he kept\\npassing his hand over his hair, could he find a word to say. However,\\nthis timidity, this state of agitation, did not last long, for soon her\\ncalmness infected him, and within a quarter of an hour he was talking\\nto her of his father, his uncle, and life in St. Petersburg and the\\ncountry. For her part, she listened with kindly interest, while gently\\nopening and closing her fan. Thus only at moments when other cavaliers\\ncame to ask her for dances (Sitnikov did this twice) did Arkady\\'s\\nchatter become interrupted; and whenever she returned to her place,\\nto reseat herself with her bosom heaving not a whit more rapidly than\\nit had done before, he would plunge into renewed conversation, so\\ndelighted was he at the fact that he had found some one to sympathise\\nwith him, to whom he could talk, at whose beautiful eyes and forehead\\nand gentle, refined, intellectual features he could gaze at leisure.\\nShe herself said little, but her every word showed a knowledge of life\\nwhich pointed to the fact that already this young woman had thought and\\nfelt much.\\n\\n\"Who was the man with you before Sitnikov brought you to me?\" she\\ninquired.\\n\\n\"So you noticed my friend?\" exclaimed Arkady. \"Has he not a splendid\\nface? His name is Bazarov.\"\\n\\nAnd, once launched upon the subject, Arkady descanted so fully, and\\nwith such enthusiasm, that Madame Odintsov turned to observe his friend\\nmore closely. But soon the mazurka began to draw to a close, and Arkady\\nfound himself regretting the prospect of losing the companion with whom\\nhe had spent such a pleasant hour. True, he had felt, throughout, that\\nhe was being treated with condescension, and ought to be grateful; but\\nupon young hearts such an obligation does not press with any great\\nweight.\\n\\nThe music stopped with a jerk.\\n\\n\"_Merci_!\" said Madame Odintsov--then rose. \"You have promised to come\\nand see me. Also, bring with you your friend, for I am filled with\\ncuriosity to behold a man who has the temerity to believe in nothing.\"\\n\\nNext, the Governor approached Madame with a distraught air and an\\nintimation that supper was ready; whereupon she took his proffered arm,\\nand, as she departed, turned with a last smile and nod to Arkady, who,\\nin answer, bowed and stood following her with his eyes. How straight\\nher figure looked under the sheen of her black gown!\\n\\n\"Already she will have forgotten my existence,\" he thought to himself,\\nwhile an exquisite humility pervaded his soul. Then he rejoined Bazarov\\nin their joint corner.\\n\\n\"Well?\" his friend said. \"Have you enjoyed yourself? Some man or other\\nhas just been telling me that the lady in question is---- But in all\\nprobability the man was a fool. What do _you_ think of her?\"\\n\\n\"The allusion escapes me,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\n\"Come, come, young innocence!\"\\n\\n\"Or at all events your informant\\'s meaning escapes me. Madame is nice,\\nbut as cold and formal as, as----\"\\n\\n\"As a stagnant pool,\" concluded Bazarov. \"Yes, we all know the sort of\\nthing. You say that she is cold, but that is purely a matter of taste.\\nPerhaps you yourself like ice?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do,\" the other muttered. \"But of such things I am no judge;\\nand in any case she wishes to make your acquaintance as well as mine,\\nand has asked me to bring you with me to call.\"\\n\\n\"The description of me which you gave is easily imagined! On the other\\nhand, you did rightly to offer her us both, for no matter who she may\\nbe--whether a provincial lioness or only an \\'_émancipée_\\' like the\\nKukshin woman, she has at least such a pair of shoulders as I have not\\nseen this many a day.\"\\n\\nArkady recoiled from this cynicism, yet, as often happens in such\\ncases, started to reproach his friend for something wholly unconnected\\nwith the utterance which had given umbrage.\\n\\n\"Why do you refuse women freedom of thought?\" he asked under his breath.\\n\\n\"For the reason, dear sir, that, according to my observation of life,\\nno woman, unless she be a freak, thinks _with_ freedom.\"\\n\\nAnd here the conversation terminated, for supper had come to an end,\\nand the friends departed. As they left the room Madame Kukshin followed\\nthem with a nervous and wrathful, yet slightly apprehensive, smile in\\nher eyes. The reason of this was that she felt wounded in her conceit\\nat the fact that neither of the young men had taken any notice of her.\\nNevertheless, she remained at the ball until most of the rest of the\\ncompany had left; whereafter, it being four o\\'clock in the morning, she\\ndanced a polka-mazurka, _à la Parisienne_, with Sitnikov, and with this\\nedifying spectacle brought the Governor\\'s fête to a close.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\n\\n\"Now let us see to what category of mortals to assign this young\\nperson,\" said Bazarov to Arkady as, on the following day, the pair\\nmounted the staircase of the hotel where Madame Odintsov was staying.\\n\"Somehow I seem to scent impropriety in the air.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me!\" burst forth Arkady. \"Do _you_, Bazarov, do _you_\\nhold with the narrow-minded morality which----\"\\n\\n\"Idiot!\" exclaimed Bazarov contemptuously. \"Do you not know that\\nboth in our jargon and in the understanding of the ordinary person\\nthe term \\'improper\\' has now come to mean the same as \\'proper\\'? In\\nany case I seem to scent money here. You yourself told me, did you\\nnot, that Madame\\'s marriage was a very strange one?--though, for my\\npart, I look upon marrying a rich old man as anything but a strange\\nproceeding--rather, as a measure of prudence. True, I place little\\nreliance upon the gossip of townsfolk, but at least I prefer to suppose\\nthat that gossip has, as our cultured Governor would say, \\'a basis in\\nfact.\\'\"\\n\\nArkady did not respond, but knocked at the door of Madame\\'s suite;\\nand, the door having been opened, a liveried man-servant ushered the\\nvisitors into a large, hideously furnished room of the type which\\nis always to be found in Russian hotels--the only exception in the\\npresent case being that the apartment was adorned with flowers.\\nPresently Madame herself entered, clad in a plain morning gown, and\\nlooking even younger in the spring sunlight than she had done in the\\nballroom. Arkady duly presented Bazarov, and, as he did so, remarked\\nwith surprise that his friend seemed confused, while Madame was as\\nimperturbable as ever. This _gaucherie_ on his part Bazarov realised,\\nand felt vexed at.\\n\\n\"Phaugh!\" he thought to himself. \"The idea that I should be afraid of a\\nwoman!\"\\n\\nYet, like Sitnikov, he could only subside into a chair, and fall to\\ntalking with an exaggerated emphasis to the woman who sat with her\\nbrilliant eyes riveted with such attention upon him.\\n\\nAnna Sergievna Odintsov had had for father one Sergei Nikolaievitch\\nLoktev, a well-known gambler, speculator, and beau. After fifteen years\\nof flaunting it in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and dissipating his whole\\nsubstance, he had been forced to retire to the country, where soon\\nafterwards he had died and left to his daughter Anna (aged twenty) and\\nhis daughter Katerina (aged twelve) only a small joint competence.\\nAs for the girls\\' mother (who had come of the impoverished house of\\nthe Princes X.), she had expired during the heyday of her husband\\'s\\ncareer in St. Petersburg. Anna\\'s position after her father\\'s death was\\ntherefore a very difficult one, for the brilliant education which she\\nhad received in the capital had in no way fitted her for the care of\\na household and an estate, nor yet for the endurance of a life in the\\ncountry. Moreover, she possessed not a single acquaintance in that\\ncountry neighbourhood, nor any one to whom to turn for advice, since\\nher father had done his best to avoid associating with his neighbours,\\nin that he had despised them as much as they, in their several ways,\\nhad despised him. Howbeit, Anna kept her head, and straightway sent\\nfor her mother\\'s sister, the Princess Avdotia Stepanovna X., who, a\\nmalicious, presuming old woman, annexed, on the day of her arrival, all\\nthe best rooms in the house, raged and stormed from morning till night,\\nand even declined to walk in the garden unless she could be accompanied\\nby her only serf, a sullen-looking lacquey who wore a faded green\\nlivery, a blue collar, and a three-cornered hat. Nevertheless Anna put\\nup with these tantrums of her aunt\\'s, superintended the education of\\nher sister, and resigned herself to the idea of living in seclusion for\\nthe rest of her life. But fate had ordained otherwise. That is to say,\\na certain Odintsov--a rich, bloated, unwieldy, soured, semi-imbecile\\nhypochondriac of forty-six who was, nevertheless, neither stupid nor\\ncruel--happened to see her, and became so enamoured that he offered her\\nmarriage: and to this proposal she consented. For six years the pair\\nlived together, before the husband died, leaving her all his property.\\nThe following year she spent in the country; after which she went\\nabroad with her sister--but only as far as Germany, since she quickly\\nwearied of foreign parts, and was only too thankful to return to her\\nbeloved Nikolsköe, which lay some forty versts from the provincial town\\nof ----. At Nikolsköe she had at her disposal a splendid, tastefully\\nfurnished mansion, a beautiful garden, and a range of orangeries (the\\nlate Odintsov having denied himself in nothing); but inasmuch as she\\nmade but rare appearances in the town, and then only on flying visits\\nconnected with business, the provincial gentry conceived a grudge\\nagainst her, and took to gossiping of her marriage with Odintsov, and\\nrelating such impossible tales as that she had assisted her father in\\nhis nefarious schemes, that she had had her reasons for going abroad,\\nand that certain unfortunate results of that tour had had to be\\nconcealed. \"I tell you,\" the ardent retailer of such fables would say,\\n\"that she has been through the mill right enough.\" Eventually these\\nrumours reached her ears, but she ignored them altogether, since her\\nnature was at once bold and independent.\\n\\nSeating herself at full length in an armchair, and crossing one hand\\nover the other, she set herself to listen to Bazarov\\'s harangue.\\nContrary to his usual custom, he spoke without restraint, for he\\nwas clearly anxious to interest his listener. Arkady again felt\\nsurprised at this, though he failed to detect whether or not Bazarov\\nwas succeeding in his aim, seeing that Anna Sergievna\\'s face gave no\\nclue to the effect produced, so fixedly did her features retain their\\nfaintly polite expression, so unvaryingly did her beautiful eyes\\nreflect unruffled attention. True, at first Bazarov\\'s vehemence gave\\nher an unpleasant impression as of a bad smell or a jarring note; but\\nin time she began to understand that it came of his being ill at ease,\\nand she felt flattered at the fact. Only the paltry repelled her; and\\nno one could well have accused Bazarov of that quality. Indeed wonders\\nwere never to cease for Arkady, since, though he had expected Bazarov\\nto talk to Madame Odintsov as to a woman of intellect--to speak to her\\nof his views and convictions (seeing that she had expressed a desire\\nto behold a man who had \"the temerity to believe in nothing\"), he\\ndiscoursed only on medicine, homoeopathy, and botany. At the same time,\\nMadame had not wasted her life of solitude, but had read a large number\\nof standard works, and could express herself in the best of Russian;\\nand though at one point she diverted the conversation to music, she\\nno sooner perceived that he declined to recognise the existence of\\nthe art than she returned to botany, even though Arkady would gladly\\nhave continued the discussion of the importance of national melodies.\\nIn passing, her treatment of Arkady as a younger brother remained\\nthe same. What she valued in him was, evidently, the good humour and\\nsimplicity of youth--nothing more. Thus there was held, for three\\nhours, an animated, but intermittent, discursive conversation.\\n\\nAt length the friends rose to say farewell. With a kindly glance Anna\\nSergievna offered them her beautiful white hand; then, after a moment\\'s\\nreflection, said irresolutely, but with a pleasant smile:\\n\\n\"If neither of you fear finding the time tedious, will you come and pay\\nme a visit at Nikolsköe?\"\\n\\n\"I should deem it the greatest pleasure!\" cried Arkady.\\n\\n\"And you, Monsieur Bazarov?\"\\n\\nBazarov merely bowed: which again surprised Arkady, while also he\\nnoticed that his friend\\'s face looked flushed.\\n\\n\"Well?\" the younger man said as the pair issued into the street. \"Are\\nyou still of the opinion that she is, is----?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot say. But what an icicle she has made of herself!\" There was\\na pause. \"At all events, she is an imposing personage, a _grande dame_\\nwho lacks but a train to her gown and a coronet to her head.\"\\n\\n\"But none of our _grandes dames_ speak Russian as she does,\" remarked\\nArkady.\\n\\n\"No; for she has undergone a rebirth, and eaten of our bread.\"\\n\\n\"And what a charm is hers!\"\\n\\n\"You mean, what a splendid body--the very thing for a dissecting\\ntheatre!\"\\n\\n\"Stop, stop, for God\\'s sake! Her body differs from all other women\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"No need to lose your temper, young innocent. Have I not said that she\\nstands in the front rank of women? Yes, we must pay her that visit.\"\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"The day after to-morrow. Nothing else is to be done here, for we\\nneed not stay to drink champagne with the Kukshin woman, and listen\\nto the harangues of your kinsman, the Liberal bigwig. Not we! The day\\nafter to-morrow, therefore, let us give the whole thing the go-by. _A\\npropos_, my father\\'s place lies near Nikolsköe. For Nikolsköe is on the\\n---- road, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"It is.\"\\n\\n\"_Optime!_ Then we shall gain nothing by delay: only fools and clever\\npeople procrastinate. Her anatomy, I repeat, is splendid.\"\\n\\nWithin three days, in bright, but not too warm, weather, the two\\nfriends were bowling along the road to Nikolsköe. With a will did the\\nwell-fed stage horses trot out, and lightly swish their flanks with\\ntheir plaited, knotted tails; and as Arkady glanced along the road, he,\\nfor some unknown reason, smiled.\\n\\n\"Congratulate me!\" cried Bazarov of a sudden. \"To-day is the 22nd of\\nJune--the feast of my Patron Saint. Certainly he looks after me, does\\nhe not?\" Then the speaker added in a lower tone: \"But to-day, also,\\nthey are expecting me at home.... Well, let them expect me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI\\n\\n\\nThe manor-house in which Anna Sergievna resided stood on an open\\nhillock, and close to a yellow stone church with a green roof, white\\ncolumns, and an entrance surmounted by a fresco representative of Our\\nLord\\'s Resurrection--the latter executed in the \"Italian\" style, and\\nhaving as its most noticeable feature the figure of a swarthy warrior\\nwhose rounded contours filled the entire foreground. Behind the church,\\nthe village extended into two long wings, and had thatched roofs\\nsurmounted by a medley of chimneys; while the manor-house itself was\\nbuilt in a style homogeneous with the design of the church--that is\\nto say, in the style commonly known as \"Alexandrine,\" and embracing\\nyellow-painted walls, a green roof, white columns, and a front\\nadorned with a coat-of-arms. In fact, both buildings had been erected\\nby a provincial architect to the order of the late Odintsov, a man\\nimpatient (so he himself always expressed it) of \"vain and arbitrary\\ninnovations.\" Lastly, to right and left of the house there showed the\\ntrees of an antique garden, while an avenue of clipped firs led the way\\nto the principal entrance.\\n\\nThe friends having been met in the hall by two strapping lacqueys in\\nlivery, one of the latter immediately ran for the butler; who (a stout\\nman in a black tail-coat) proceeded to usher the guests up a carpeted\\nstaircase, and into a room which contained a couple of beds and the\\nusual appurtenances of the toilet. Evidently neatness was the order of\\nthe day in the establishment, for everything was both spotlessly clean\\nand as fragrant as the chamber wherein a Minister of State holds his\\nreceptions.\\n\\n\"Anna Sergievna will be glad to see you in half an hour,\" the butler\\nsaid. \"Meanwhile, have you any orders for me?\"\\n\\n\"No, worthy one,\" replied Bazarov. \"Except that you might so far\\ncondescend as to bring me a small glassful of _vodka_.\"\\n\\n\"It shall be done, sir,\" said the butler with a shade of hesitation;\\nwhereafter he departed with creaking boots.\\n\\n\"What grandeur!\" commented Bazarov. \"In your opinion, how ought our\\nhostess to be addressed? In the style of a duchess?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and of a very great duchess,\" replied Arkady. \"The more so,\\nseeing that she has invited such influential aristocrats as ourselves\\nto visit her.\"\\n\\n\"I presume that you are referring to your humble servant--a future\\ndoctor, the son of a doctor, and the grandson of a sexton? By the\\nway, are you aware that my grandparent was a sexton, even as was\\nSperansky\\'s?\"[1] A smile curled his lips. \"Thus you see that the lady\\nis mistaken, woefully mistaken. We haven\\'t such a thing as a tail-coat,\\nhave we?\"\\n\\nArkady shrugged his shoulders bravely; but he too was feeling a little\\nawe-stricken.\\n\\nAt the close of the half-hour the pair entered the drawing-room, which\\nthey found to be a large, lofty apartment of rich, but tasteless,\\nappointments. Against the walls, in the usual affected style, stood\\nheavy, expensive furniture, the walls themselves were hung with brown\\ncurtains to which were florid gilt borders (all these things the late\\nOdintsov had ordered through a Muscovite friend who kept a wineshop),\\nand above a divan in the centre of the room hung a portrait of a\\nwrinkled, sandy-haired individual who seemed to be regarding the\\nnewcomers with extreme distaste.\\n\\n\"_He_,\" whispered Bazarov.\\n\\nThe hostess herself then entered. She was clad in a light dress, and\\nhad her hair dressed behind the ears--a style which communicated to\\nher pure, fresh countenance an air of almost girlish juvenility.\\n\\n\"Thank you for having kept your promise,\" she said. \"And now that you\\nare come, I think that you will find the time not altogether dull. For\\none thing, I intend to introduce you to my sister, who is a skilful\\npiano-player (of course, Monsieur Bazarov, to you such things are a\\nmatter of indifference, but you, Monsieur Kirsanov, I know, adore the\\nart of music). Also, an elderly aunt lives with me as my companion, and\\nat intervals a neighbour looks in for a game of cards. You see our home\\ncircle. Now let us seat ourselves.\"\\n\\nMadame delivered this little speech with the precision of a lesson\\nwhich she had learnt by heart, and then turned to converse with Arkady.\\nOn finding that her mother had known his, and that the latter had\\nmade the former her confidant during her love affair with Nikolai\\nPetrovitch, the lad fell to speaking enthusiastically of his dead\\nparent, while Bazarov applied himself to the inspection of some albums.\\n\\n\"What a domesticated individual I am!\" thought he to himself.\\n\\nPresently, with much pattering of paws, there burst into the room a\\nsplendid Russian greyhound with a blue collar; and it was followed by\\na young girl of eighteen with a dark complexion, dark hair, a round,\\nbut pleasant, face, and small, dark eyes. She was carrying a basket of\\nflowers.\\n\\n\"My sister Katia,\" said Madame Odintsov, indicating the girl with her\\nhead.\\n\\nKatia seated herself beside Madame, and fell to arranging her flowers;\\nwhile the greyhound (whose name was Fifi) approached each of the guests\\nin turn, laid his cold nose in their hands, and wagged his tail.\\n\\n\"Have you gathered those flowers yourself?\" asked Madame Odintsov.\\n\\n\"Yes, Anna Sergievna,\" the girl replied.\\n\\n\"And is your aunt going to join us at tea?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nThese replies of Katia\\'s were accompanied with a frank, but gentle\\nand bashful, smile, and an upward glance half grave, half sportive.\\nEverything in her betokened youth and freshness--her voice, the down on\\nher cheeks, her little pink hands with their white, dimpled palms, and\\nthe slightly contracted shoulders. Also, she blushed without ceasing,\\nand drew her breath with a fluttering respiration.\\n\\nPresently Madame Odintsov turned to Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Surely it is only out of politeness that you are looking at those\\nphotographs?\" she said. \"They cannot possibly interest you. Pray move\\nnearer to us, and let us engage in an argument.\"\\n\\nBazarov approached her.\\n\\n\"What shall we argue about?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"About anything you like. But first let me warn you that I am a\\nredoubtable opponent.\"\\n\\n\"You?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly. You look surprised? Why so?\"\\n\\n\"Because, so far as I can tell, your temperament is one of the cold and\\nlethargic order, whereas argument needs impulsiveness.\"\\n\\n\"How have you contrived so quickly to appraise me? To begin with, I am\\nboth impatient and exacting. Ask Katia if I am not. Also, I am easily\\nmoved to impulse.\"\\n\\nBazarov darted a glance at her.\\n\\n\"Possibly,\" he said. \"Certainly you ought to know best. But, since\\nyou desire to argue, let us argue. While looking at those views of\\nSaxon Switzerland, I heard you remark that they could not interest\\nme. This you said, I presume, because you suppose me to be lacking in\\nthe artistic sense. Well, I am so. But might not those pictures be\\ninteresting to me solely from the geological point of view--from the\\nstandpoint of an observer, say, of the formation of mountains?\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, but, as a geologist, you would prefer to resort to some\\nspecial work on that science, not to a few pictures.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, not necessarily. For a picture may instantly present what a book\\ncould set forth only in a hundred pages.\"\\n\\nAnna Sergievna made no reply.\\n\\n\"Well,\" she resumed, leaning forward upon the table--a movement which\\nbrought her face closer to Bazarov\\'s, \"since you possess not a grain of\\nthe artistic instinct, how do you contrive to get on without it?\"\\n\\n\"Rather, I would ask you: What is the artistic instinct able to effect?\"\\n\\n\"It is able at least to help one to examine and to instruct one\\'s\\nfellow man.\"\\n\\nBazarov smiled.\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" he retorted, \"the prime requisite in that\\nconnection is experience of life; and, in the second place, the study\\nof detached personalities is scarcely worth the trouble. For all we\\nhuman beings are alike, in body as in spirit. In each of us there is an\\nidentical brain, an identical spleen, an identical heart, an identical\\npair of lungs, an identical stock of the so-called moral qualities\\n(trifling variations between which we need not take into account).\\nTherefore from a single specimen of the human race may all the rest be\\njudged. In fact, human beings are like trees in a forest. You never\\nfind a botanist studying its individual trunks.\"\\n\\nKatia, who had been arranging her flowers, glanced at Bazarov in\\namazement, and, in so doing, encountered his keen, contemptuous gaze,\\nand blushed to her ears. Anna Sergievna shook her head.\\n\\n\"Trees in a forest!\" she exclaimed. \"Think you, then, that there is no\\ndifference between the wise man and the fool, the good and the bad?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not,\" replied Bazarov. \"On the contrary, I believe that such\\ndifferences do exist. The point is that they exist only as between\\nthe sound and the ailing. For instance, a consumptive\\'s lungs are not\\nas yours and mine; yet they have been fashioned precisely as our own\\nhave been. Also, whereas, to a certain extent, we know whence bodily\\ndisorders arise, _moral_ disorders come of faulty education, the\\nthousand and one follies with which the human brain is afflicted, in\\nshort, any irregular condition of the social body. Rectify that body,\\nand moral sickness will soon cease to be.\"\\n\\nSpeaking as though he were saying to himself, \"Believe me or not as you\\nlike, it is all one to me,\" Bazarov drew his long fingers through his\\nwhiskers, while his eyes glowed like coals.\\n\\n\"Then you think,\" pursued Anna Sergievna, \"that, once the social body\\nhas been rectified, stupid and evil people will cease to exist?\"\\n\\n\"At all events, once the social body is properly organised, the\\nfact that a man be wise or stupid, good or bad, will cease to be of\\nimportance.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! I understand! That is because we all possess an identical spleen?\"\\n\\n\"Precisely so, madam.\"\\n\\nShe turned to Arkady.\\n\\n\"And what is your opinion, Arkady Nikolaievitch?\" she enquired.\\n\\n\"I agree with Evgenii,\" was his reply as, in his turn, he received a\\nglance of astonishment from Katia.\\n\\n\"I am surprised, gentlemen,\" said Madame. \"However, I can hear my aunt\\napproaching, so let us spare her ears, and discuss this later.\"\\n\\nAnna Sergievna\\'s aunt--a small, spare woman with a mallet-shaped face,\\na pair of narrow, malicious eyes, and a grey false front--bestowed\\nscarcely so much as a bow upon the guests, but at once relapsed into a\\nhuge velvet armchair which no one but herself was allowed to use. And\\neven when Katia hastened to place for her a footstool, the old woman\\ndid not thank her, nor even look at her, but chafed her hands under the\\nyellow shawl which covered the whole of her frail figure. Beyond all\\nthings was she fond of yellow; wherefore she had had her cap trimmed\\nwith ribands of the same hue.\\n\\n\"Have you slept well, Auntie?\" Madame Odintsov inquired with a raising\\nof her voice.\\n\\n\"That dog is here again!\" the old woman muttered on noticing that Fifi\\nwas taking an irresolute step or two in her direction. \"Turn the beast\\nout, I say! Out with it!\"\\n\\nCalling Fifi, Katia opened the door for the animal to leave the room;\\nwhereupon, though it bounded out in joyous mood (under the impression\\nthat it was about to be taken for a walk), it no sooner found itself\\nmarooned outside than it fell to whining and scratching at the panels;\\nwhich caused the Princess to frown, and necessitated Katia\\'s exit to\\nrectify matters.\\n\\n\"Tea is ready, I believe,\" Madame Odintsov continued. \"Gentlemen, pray\\ncome. Will you have some tea, Auntie?\"\\n\\nThe Princess rose from her chair in silence, and headed a procession\\nto the dining-room, where a Cossack footman pulled a padded armchair\\nfrom under the table (like the last, it was reserved for the Princess\\nalone), and she subsided into its depths. Katia poured out tea, and\\nhanded her aunt the first cup--a cup adorned with a coat-of-arms;\\nwhereafter the old woman added some honey to the beverage (she looked\\nupon tea-drinking with sugar as a sin of extravagance, and the more\\nso since never at any time would she consent to spend an unnecessary\\nkopeck), and then asked hoarsely:\\n\\n\"What has Prince Ivan to say in his letter?\"\\n\\nNo one answered, and in time Bazarov and Arkady apprised the fact that,\\nthough treated, certainly, with respect, the old woman attracted no\\none\\'s serious attention.\\n\\n\"They keep her here for show,\" Bazarov reflected. \"She is kept because\\nshe comes of a princely house.\"\\n\\nTea over, Anna Sergievna proposed a walk; but since at that moment a\\ndrop of rain came pattering down, the company (with the exception of\\nthe Princess) returned to the drawing-room. Presently the neighbour\\naddicted to a game of cards came in, and proved to be one Porphyri\\nPlatonitch--a stout, grey-headed, affable, diverting individual who,\\nin addition, could boast of a pair of legs as shapely as though turned\\nwith a lathe. Anna Sergievna then inquired of Bazarov (with whom she\\nhad again been in conversation) whether he would care to join them in\\nthe old-fashioned game of \"Preferences\"; and he consented on the ground\\nthat he could not too soon prepare himself for the post of a district\\nphysician.\\n\\n\"But take care,\" remarked his hostess. \"Porphyri Platonitch and I\\nare not unlikely to beat you. Meanwhile, do you, Katia, go and play\\nsomething on the piano for the benefit of Arkady Nikolaievitch. I know\\nthat he loves music, and we too shall be glad to listen to you.\"\\n\\nReluctantly Katia approached the piano; nor, in spite of Arkady\\'s\\nfondness for music, did he follow her any more eagerly.\\n\\nThe truth of it was that he felt himself to be being \"got rid of\" by\\nMadame Odintsov, and already there was simmering in his heart, as in\\nthe heart of any young man of his age, that vague, oppressive feeling\\nwhich is the harbinger of love.\\n\\nRaising the lid of the piano, Katia murmured under her breath, and\\nwithout looking at Arkady:\\n\\n\"What shall I play?\"\\n\\n\"Anything you wish,\" he replied with indifference.\\n\\n\"But what sort of music do you _prefer_?\" she persisted with unchanged\\nattitude.\\n\\n\"Classical music,\" was the reply delivered with equal nonchalance.\\n\\n\"Mozart?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--Mozart.\"\\n\\nSo Katia produced the Viennese master\\'s Sonata-Fantasia in C minor.\\nShe played it well, but coldly, and not with any excess of precision.\\nLikewise, she kept her lips compressed, her eyes upon the keys, and\\nher form erect and motionless. Only towards the close of the piece did\\nher face kindle at all, while at the same moment a tiny curl detached\\nitself from her loosely-bound hair, and fell over her dusky forehead.\\n\\nArkady also felt moved by the closing portion of the Sonata--the\\nportion where the charming, careless gaiety of the melody gives place\\nto sudden bursts of mournful, almost tragic lamentation. Yet the\\nthoughts which Mozart\\'s strains aroused in him bore no relation to\\nKatia. He merely looked at her now and then, and reflected:\\n\\n\"She plays well; nor is she bad-looking.\"\\n\\nThe Sonata over, Katia inquired, without removing her hands from the\\nkeyboard: \"Is that enough?\" and Arkady replied that he would not think\\nof troubling her further. Then he went on to talk of Mozart, and to\\nask her whether she herself had selected the Sonata, or whether it had\\nbeen selected for her by some one. Katia answered in monosyllables, and\\nfrom time to time went into hiding, retired into herself; and on each\\noccasion of this sort she made her reappearance but reluctantly, and\\nwith a face composed to a stubborn, almost a stupid, air. Yet she was\\nnot timid so much as diffident and a trifle overawed by the presence of\\nthe sister who had brought her up (not that the sister in question ever\\nsuspected it). Finally, she returned to her flowers, and Arkady found\\nhimself reduced to calling Fifi to his side, and stroking the dog\\'s\\nhead with a kindly smile.\\n\\nAs for Bazarov, he had to pay forfeit after forfeit, for Anna Sergievna\\nwas fairly clever at cards, and Porphyri Platonitch was a player\\nfully able to look after himself. Consequently the young doctor rose\\na loser, not by a considerable sum, but by one which, at all events,\\nwas sufficient to be scarcely agreeable. After supper Anna Sergievna\\nstarted a discussion on botany.\\n\\n\"I wish you would take me for a walk to-morrow morning,\" she said. \"I\\nwant you to teach me the Latin names of our field flowers, and also\\ntheir characteristics.\"\\n\\n\"But how could the Latin names benefit you?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"System is in all things necessary,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"A truly wonderful woman!\" Arkady commented the same evening, on\\nfinding himself alone with his friend in the bedroom.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Bazarov. \"She certainly possesses brains. Also, she has\\ndreamed dreams.\"\\n\\n\"In what sense?\"\\n\\n\"In the best sense, my friend--in the very best sense, O Arkady\\nNikolaievitch. Certain also am I that she manages her property well.\\nBut the marvellous phenomenon is not she, but her sister.\"\\n\\n\"What? That hoyden?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that hoyden. The hoyden contains an element of freshness and\\nvirginity and timidity and reticence and anything else you like which\\nmakes her really an object worthy of interest. Of the one you could\\nmake whatsoever you might desire, whereas of the other there is\\nnothing to be said save that she represents a yesterday\\'s loaf.\"\\n\\nArkady made no reply, and soon the two men were asleep and dreaming\\ntheir own dreams.\\n\\nThe same night Anna Sergievna devoted much thought to her two guests.\\nBazarov she liked both for his total lack of affectation and for\\nthe piquancy of his criticisms; so that she seemed to divine in him\\nsomething new, something which had hitherto remained unknown to her\\nexperience. All of which excited her curiosity.\\n\\nAnd she too was a strange being. Free from all prejudice, and devoid\\nof all strong beliefs, she rendered obeisance to nothing, and had\\nin view no goal. Again, though much was open to her sight, and much\\ninterested her, nothing really satisfied her, and she had no wish\\nfor such satisfaction, since her intellect was at once inquiring\\nand indifferent, and harboured doubts which never merged into\\ninsensibility, and aspirations which never swelled into unrest. True,\\nif she had been dowered with less wealth and independence, she might\\nhave plunged into the fray, and learnt the nature of passion; but, as\\nthings stood, she took life unhastingly, and, though often finding\\nit tedious, spent her days in a deliberate, rarely agitated manner.\\nTrue, at times rainbow colours gleamed even before _her_ eyes; yet\\nno sooner had they faded than she would draw her breath as before,\\nand in no way regret their disappearance. Again, though, at times,\\nher imagination exceeded the bounds of what is considered permissible\\nby conventional morality, her blood still coursed tranquilly through\\nher lethargic and bewitchingly shaped frame; and only when she was\\nissuing in a warm and tender glow from her comfortable bathroom would\\nshe fall to pondering upon the futility of life, its sorrow and toil\\nand cruelty, and feel her soul swell to sudden temerity, and begin to\\nseethe with noble aspirations. Yet even then, let but a draught happen\\nto blow in her direction from an open window, and at once she would\\nshrug her shoulders, commiserate herself, come very near to losing her\\ntemper, and become conscious of nothing but the thought that the one\\nthing necessary was to ensure that by hook or by crook that abominable\\ndraught should be averted.\\n\\nAgain, like all women who have never known what it is to fall in\\nlove, she was sensible of a persistent yearning for something wholly\\nundefined. There was nothing that she actually lacked, yet she seemed\\nto lack everything. The late Odintsov she had merely tolerated (the\\nmarriage having been one _de convenance_ only--though she would never\\nhave consented to become his wife had he not also been kindly of\\nheart), and from the experience she had derived a certain aversion to\\nthe male sex in general, which she conceived to be composed exclusively\\nof creatures slovenly, idle, wearisome, and weakly exacting in their\\nhabits. In fact, only once had she met (it was somewhere abroad) a\\nman who had in any way attracted her. He had been a young Swede of a\\nknightly countenance, honest blue eyes, and an open brow; but, for all\\nthe impression that he had made upon her, the impression in question\\nhad not prevented her from shortly afterwards returning to Russia.\\n\\n\"A strange man, that Bazarov,\" she thought to herself as she reposed\\nin her magnificent bed with its lace-embroidered pillows and its light\\nsilken coverlet. It may be said, that, in addition to having inherited\\nher late father\\'s fastidious and luxurious tastes, she still cherished\\nfor that wayward, but kindhearted, parent a considerable affection,\\nsince during his lifetime he had not only adored her and cracked jokes\\nwith her on equal terms, but also accorded her his whole confidence,\\nand made it his invariable custom to seek her advice. Of her mother she\\nhad but the scantiest of remembrance.\\n\\n\"Yes, a strange man is that Bazarov,\" she repeated; after which she\\nstretched her limbs, smiled, clasped her hands behind her head, ran an\\neye over the pages of two foolish French novels, let fall the second\\nof these volumes from her hands, and relapsed into slumber--a cold,\\nspotless figure in spotless, fragrant white.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over next morning, she set forth upon the botanising\\nexpedition with Bazarov; to return home just before luncheon time.\\nMeanwhile Arkady did not leave the house, but spent an hour with Katia,\\nnor found the time wearisome, seeing that of her own accord Katia\\nvolunteered to repeat the Sonata. Yet the instant that his eyes beheld\\nMadame Odintsov returning his heart leapt within him. She was crossing\\nthe garden with a slightly tired step, but with her cheeks rosy of hue,\\nher eyes shining under her round straw hat with even greater brilliancy\\nthan usual, and her fingers twirling between them the stalk of some\\nfield flower. Also, her light mantilla had slipped to her shoulders,\\nand the broad ribands of her hat were floating over her bosom.\\nBehind her walked Bazarov with his usual air of superciliousness and\\nself-assurance, while on his face there was an expression cheerful, and\\neven good-humoured. Yet somehow, Arkady did not like that expression.\\n\\nMuttering \"Good-morning,\" Bazarov passed towards his room, while Madame\\nOdintsov accorded the young man a negligent handshake--then similarly\\ncontinued her way.\\n\\n\"\\'Good morning!\\'\" thought Arkady to himself. \"One would think that she\\nand I had made one another\\'s acquaintance only to-day!\"\\n\\n\\n[1] Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (1811-1899), chemist and physicist; inventor\\nof Bunsen\\'s burner and magnesium light; and originator (with Kirchhov)\\nof spectrum analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII\\n\\n\\nAs we know, time either flies like a bird or crawls like a snail. Thus\\na man is in best case when he fails to notice either the rapidity or\\nthe slowness of its flight. Similarly did Bazarov and Arkady spend\\ntheir fortnight at Madame Odintsov\\'s. Of this another contributory\\ncause was the fact that alike in her household and in her daily life\\nshe maintained a _régime_ to which she herself strictly adhered, and\\nto which she constrained others to adhere; so that the daily domestic\\nround accomplished itself according to a fixed programme. At eight\\no\\'clock the company would assemble for breakfast; whereafter, until\\nluncheon time, individuals could do whatsoever they chose (the hostess\\nherself devoting her attention to her steward--she administered her\\nestate on the _obrok_ or tithes system--her household servants, and her\\nhead housekeeper). Next, before dinner, the company would reassemble\\nfor conversation or for reading aloud; and the rest of the evening\\nwould be devoted to a walk, to cards, or to music. Lastly, at half-past\\nten Anna Sergievna would withdraw to her room, issue her orders for the\\nfollowing day, and retire to bed.\\n\\nBut to Bazarov this measured, slightly formal regularity was not wholly\\nagreeable. \"Somehow it reminds one of running on a pair of rails,\" he\\nused to declare; while so much did the sight of liveried lacqueys and\\ngraded serfs offend his democratic instincts that once he averred that\\none might as well dine in the English fashion outright, and wear white\\nties and black tail-coats. These views he expressed to Anna Sergievna\\n(something in her always led men to lay bare their opinions in her\\npresence); and, after she had heard him out, she said: \"From your\\npoint of view, the matter is as you say, and perhaps I play the fine\\nlady too much; but in the country one cannot live anyhow; such a course\\nalways leads one to grow slovenly.\"\\n\\nSo she continued her _régime_ as before. Yet, though Bazarov grumbled,\\nhe and Arkady found that to that very formality they owed the fact that\\neverything in the establishment \"ran as on rails.\" In passing it may be\\nmentioned that between the two young men there had taken place a change\\nwhich dated from the day of their arrival at Nikolsköe, and manifested\\nitself, as regards Bazarov (for whom Anna Sergievna evidently\\nentertained a liking, though seldom did she agree with his _dicta_), in\\nthe form of an unwonted captiousness which led him easily to lose his\\ntemper, to speak always with reluctance, to glare about him, and to be\\nas unable to sit still as though mines had been exploding beneath his\\nseat. As for Arkady (now come finally to the conclusion that he was in\\nlove with Madame Odintsov), the change manifested itself, rather, in\\nhis falling a prey to a melancholy which in no way prevented him from\\nmaking friends with Katia, and even helped him to maintain with her\\nkindly and cordial relations.\\n\\n\"Whereas Madame cares nothing for me,\" he would reflect, \"_this_\\ngood-hearted creature does not give me the cold shoulder.\"\\n\\nAnd these reflections would cause his heart to taste once more the\\nsensuous joy of \"magnanimity.\" Dimly Katia herself divined that\\nher society afforded him a sort of comfort; wherefore she saw no\\nreason to deny either him or herself the pleasure of this innocent,\\nhalf-diffident, half-trustful _camaraderie_. True, in the presence,\\nand under the keen eye, of the elder sister (who always caused Katia\\nto retire precipitately into her shell) the pair never exchanged a\\nsingle word (indeed, as a man in love, Arkady could not well have\\npaid attention to any one but the object of his adoration while in\\nthe latter\\'s vicinity); but as soon as he found himself alone with\\nKatia he began, to a certain degree, really to enjoy himself. That is\\nto say, whereas he knew himself to be incompetent to interest Madame\\n(seeing that whenever he found himself alone with her he blushed and\\nlost his head, while she, on her side, did not know what to say to him,\\nso jejune was his mind as compared with her own), in Katia\\'s presence\\nhe felt perfectly at home, and could treat her with condescension,\\nand let her expound to him the impressions which she derived from\\nmusic and the reading of tales, poems, and other \"trifles.\" Nor did\\nhe notice, nor would he have consented to recognise had he noticed,\\nthe fact that those same \"trifles\" interested him as much as they did\\nKatia. At the same time, the latter in no way acted as a clog upon his\\nmelancholy; wherefore, just as Madame was at her ease with Bazarov,\\nso the young man was at his with Katia, and, after a short period of\\njoint converse, the two couples would usually diverge. This happened\\nespecially during walks, and the more readily in that, whereas Katia\\nadored nature, and Arkady too loved it (though he would never have\\nadmitted the fact), to Madame and Bazarov the charms of the natural\\nworld represented more or less a matter of indifference. Hardly need I\\nadd that from this constant separation between Arkady and Bazarov there\\nflowed inevitable results which brought about in the relations of the\\npair a gradual change. That is to say, Bazarov ceased to discourse on\\nMadame Odintsov--he ceased even to censure her for her \"aristocratic\\nmanners\"; and while, with regard to Katia, he sang her praises as usual\\n(at the same time advising the placing of a check upon her sentimental\\ntendencies), he took to uttering these encomiums only in a half-hearted\\nand a perfunctory way, and, in general, to lecturing his pupil less\\nthan he had formerly done. Rather, he seemed to avoid him, to feel in\\nsome way uncomfortable in his presence.\\n\\nThese things Arkady duly noted, but kept his observations to himself.\\n\\nThe real cause of the innovation was the feeling which Madame Odintsov\\ninspired in Bazarov\\'s breast, and which he found to be a torture and\\na madness to him. Yet, had any one hinted to him, ever so distantly,\\nthat what was taking place in his soul could ever have been possible,\\nhe would have denied it with a contemptuous laugh and a cynical\\nimprecation, seeing that, though a great devotee of feminine society\\nand feminine beauty, he looked upon love in the ideal, the \"romantic\"\\n(to use his own term) aspect as unpardonable folly, and upon the\\nsentiment of chivalry as a sort of aberration or malady which moved\\nhim frequently to express his astonishment that Toggenburg and his\\nMinnesingers and troubadours never ended by being clapped in a madhouse.\\n\\n\"Should a woman please you,\" he would say, \"strive to attain your goal;\\nbut if you cannot attain that goal, waste no further trouble--just turn\\naway. For the world does not rest upon a single keystone.\"\\n\\nIn similar fashion Madame Odintsov \"pleased\" Bazarov: yet, though the\\nwidespread reports in circulation about her might, with the freedom\\nand independence of her views and the undoubted _penchant_ which she\\nentertained for himself, have been reckoned to tell in his favour, he\\nsoon discovered that, in her case, the \"goal\" was _not_ to be attained.\\nAlso, he found to his surprise that he could not \"turn away\"--rather,\\nthat the mere thought of her made his blood boil. True, that symptom,\\nif it had been the only one, might have been dealt with; but there\\nbecame implanted in him something else--something which he had hitherto\\nrefused to admit, something of which he had hitherto made sport,\\nbut something which now aroused his pride. Therefore, although, when\\nconversing with Anna Sergievna, he poured added scorn upon everything\\n\"romantic,\" he recognised, during his hours of solitude, that even\\nin his own personality there lurked an element of \"Romanticism.\" And\\nat such times there was nothing for it but to rush out of doors into\\nthe woods, and to stride along at a pace which snapped off chance-met\\nboughs, and found vent in curses at both them and himself. Or he would\\nseek a hayloft or stable, and, stubbornly closing his eyes, strive to\\nwoo sleep, and almost invariably fail. Yet, as he sat there, there\\nwould come to him delusions that those proud lips _had_ once responded\\nto his kisses, that those chaste arms _had_ embraced his neck, that\\nthose soulful eyes _had_ gazed tenderly--yes, tenderly--into his: and\\nat such times his head would whirl, and for a second or two, and until\\nhis discontent returned, he would relapse into a state of trance, and,\\nas though urged by a demon, think thoughts of unavowable import. Again,\\nthere were times when he would conceive a change similar to his own to\\nhave taken place in _her_, and the expression of her face already to\\nbe charged with a special significance. Yet, this point reached, he\\nwould end merely by stamping his feet, grinding his teeth, and mentally\\nshaking his fist at himself.\\n\\nOnce, when walking with her in the garden, he announced to her in curt,\\ngruff tones that he intended soon to depart for his father\\'s place;\\nwhereupon Anna Sergievna turned pale, as though something had pricked\\nher heart, and pricked it in such a manner as to surprise even herself,\\nand to leave her wondering what it could portend. Yet not for the sake\\nof testing her, nor of seeing what might possibly come of it, had he\\nmentioned his purposed departure (never at any time did he indulge\\nin \"scheming\"). Rather, the reason was that, earlier that morning,\\nhe had had an interview with his father\\'s steward, Timotheitch, a\\nrough, but quick-witted, old fellow who, in past days, had acted as\\nhis nurse, and had now presented himself--with tousled, flaxen hair,\\nred, weather-beaten face, watery, sunken eyes, short, stout jacket of\\ngrey-blue cloth, leathern girdle, and tarred boots--at Nikolsköe.\\n\\n\"Good-day to you, ancient!\" had been Bazarov\\'s greeting.\\n\\n\"Good-day to _you, batiushka_!\" had responded the old man with a\\ngleeful smile which had covered his face with wrinkles.\\n\\n\"And how is it that I see you here?\" Bazarov had continued. \"Is it that\\nthey have sent you to fetch me?\"\\n\\n\"By no means, pardon me, _batiushka_!\" Timotheitch had stammered out\\nthis denial for the reason that he had suddenly recollected certain\\nstrict injunctions imposed upon him before starting. \"No, it is merely\\nthat I am on my way to the town on affairs connected with the estate,\\nand turned aside a little to pay my respects to your honour. No, not to\\ndisturb you at all--oh dear no!\"\\n\\n\"Do not lie,\" Bazarov had said. \"Is _this_ the way to the town?\"\\n\\nTimotheitch, cringing, had returned no reply.\\n\\n\"And how is my father?\" Bazarov had continued.\\n\\n\"Quite well, thank God!\"\\n\\n\"And my mother?\"\\n\\n\"Your mother is the same, thank God!\"\\n\\n\"And they are, I suppose, expecting me?\"\\n\\nThe old man had cocked his head with a knowing air.\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch, why should they _not_ be expecting you? Yes, as God\\nis my trust, I know that their hearts are simply aching for a sight of\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well! Do not make too long a stay of it, but tell them that I\\nwill come presently.\"\\n\\n\"I will, _batiushka_.\"\\n\\nYet it had been with a sigh that Timotheitch had replaced his cap\\non his head with both hands, left the house, remounted the shabby\\n_drozhki_ which he had left waiting at the gates, and disappeared at a\\ntrot--though _not_ in the direction of the town.\\n\\nThe same evening saw Madame sitting in her boudoir with Bazarov, and\\nArkady pacing the salon, and listening to Katia\\'s music. As for the\\nPrincess, she had gone to bed, for she could not abide the presence\\nof guests--least of all, of \"those upstarts and good-for-nothings\" as\\nshe termed our friends. In fact, though she confined herself, in the\\ndrawing-room or the dining-room, to sulking, she resorted, when alone\\nwith her maid in the bedroom, to abuse of Arkady and Bazarov which made\\nher cap and her false front fairly dance on her head. These things, of\\ncourse, Madame Odintsov knew.\\n\\n\"Why need you depart?\" she said to Bazarov. \"Have you forgotten your\\npromise?\"\\n\\nBazarov started.\\n\\n\"What promise?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Then you _have_ forgotten it! I mean the promise to give me a few\\nlessons in chemistry?\"\\n\\n\"How can I fulfil it? My father is expecting me at home, and I ought\\nnot to stay a day longer. You had better read through _Notions\\nGénérales de Chimie_, by Pelouse and Frémy. It is an excellent work,\\nand clearly written--the very thing you want.\"\\n\\n\"But you said that no book can adequately replace--I forget the exact\\nphrase you used, but you know what I mean, do you not?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot help myself,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, why go?\" She lowered her voice as she spoke. Bazarov\\nglanced at her as she leant back in her chair and crossed her arms\\n(which were bare to the elbow), and saw that by the light of the lamp\\n(softened with a shade of pleated paper) she was looking paler than\\nusual--also that the outlines of her figure were almost buried in a\\nsoft white gown, from underneath which there peeped forth the tips of\\nher toes, posed crosswise.\\n\\n\"What reason should I have for remaining?\" he replied.\\n\\nShe gave her head the faintest toss.\\n\\n\"What reason should you have?\" she re-echoed. \"Well, are you not happy\\nhere? Do you think that there will be no one to regret your departure?\"\\n\\n\"There will be no one. Of that I am certain.\"\\n\\n\"Then you are wrong,\" came the reply after a pause. \"But I do not\\nbelieve you--I have an idea that you are not speaking seriously.\"\\n\\nBazarov said nothing.\\n\\n\"Why do you not answer me?\" she persisted.\\n\\n\"What is there to say? In general, to regret people\\'s absence is not\\nworth while, and, least of all, the absence of people like myself.\"\\n\\n\"Why, again?\"\\n\\n\"Because I am a prosaic and eminently uninteresting individual. Nor do\\nI know how to talk.\"\\n\\n\"But you know how to play the esquire?\"\\n\\n\"No, not even that. And, as you know, the softer aspect of life, the\\naspect which you hold so dear, lies altogether beyond me.\"\\n\\nMadame Odintsov nibbled the corner of her handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Think what you like,\" she said, \"but at least _I_ shall find things\\ndull when you are gone.\"\\n\\n\"Arkady will remain,\" he hazarded.\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless I shall find the time wearisome,\" she repeated.\\n\\n\"Not for long.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because, as you have very truly said, things never seem dull to you\\nsave when your _régime_ is infringed. In fact, with such faultless\\nregularity have you ordered your life that there abides in it no room\\nfor dullness or depression or any other burdensome feeling.\"\\n\\n\"And I too am faultless, I suppose--I have ordered my life too\\nregularly ever to err?\"\\n\\n\"I daresay. Take an example of it. In a few minutes it will be ten\\no\\'clock; when, as I know by experience, you will request me to leave\\nyour presence.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, I shall not. You may remain. By the way, please open that\\nwindow. The room is simply stifling.\"\\n\\nBazarov rose and unfastened the casement, which swung backwards with a\\nsnap, for the reason that he had not expected it to open so easily, and\\nthat his hands were trembling. Into the aperture glanced the soft, warm\\nnight with its vista of dark vault of heaven, faintly rustling trees,\\nand pure, free, sweet-scented air.\\n\\n\"Also, please pull down the blind, and then resume your seat. I wish to\\nhave a little further talk with you before you go. Tell me something\\nabout yourself--a person to whom, by the way, you never refer.\"\\n\\n\"I would rather converse with you on more profitable subjects.\"\\n\\n\"What modesty! Nevertheless I wish to learn something of you, and of\\nyour family, and of the father for whose sake you are soon going to\\nabandon me.\"\\n\\n\"Why the word \\'abandon\\'?\" reflected Bazarov. Then he added aloud:\\n\"Things of that kind interest no one--least of all you. I and my people\\nare obscure folk.\"\\n\\n\"Whereas I, you imagine, am an aristocrat?\"\\n\\nBazarov looked up.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied with emphasis.\\n\\nShe smiled.\\n\\n\"Then I can see that your knowledge of me is small,\" she remarked.\\n\"But of course--you believe all human beings to be identical, and\\ntherefore not worth the trouble of studying. Some day I will tell you\\nmy history. But first tell me yours.\"\\n\\n\"You say that my knowledge of you is small?\" queried Bazarov. \"You may\\nbe right. Possibly _every_ human being is an enigma. Let us take an\\nexample of that. You have withdrawn from society, and find it irksome,\\nand limit your visitors\\' list to a couple of students. Yet why, with\\nyour intellect and your beauty, do you live in the country?\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" came the sharp rejoinder. \"But first be so good as to explain\\nwhat you mean by my \\'beauty.\\'\"\\n\\nBazarov frowned.\\n\\n\"That lies beside the point,\" he muttered. \"The point is that I cannot\\nunderstand why you settle in a rural spot of this kind.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot understand it, you cannot explain it?\"\\n\\n\"No. There is only one possible explanation: and that is that you\\nremain here because you are a person of self-indulgence who love\\ncomfort and the amenities of life, and are indifferent to aught else.\"\\n\\nAgain Madame Odintsov smiled.\\n\\n\"Then you are still determined to believe that I am incapable of being\\nmoved?\" she said.\\n\\nBazarov glanced at her from under his brows.\\n\\n\"By curiosity, yes,\" he said. \"But by nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Then I cease to wonder that you and I do not get on together.\\nYou are exactly like myself.\"\\n\\n\"That you and I do not get on together?\" echoed Bazarov vaguely.\\n\\n\"Yes. But I had forgotten--you must be longing to retire?\"\\n\\nBazarov rose. The lamp was casting a dim light, while into the\\nfragrant, darkened, isolated room there came wafted at intervals, under\\nthe swinging blind, the sensuous freshness of the night, and the sounds\\nof its mysterious whisperings. Madame Odintsov did not stir. Over her\\nwas stealing the same strange agitation which had infected Bazarov.\\nSuddenly he realised that he was alone with a young and beautiful woman.\\n\\n\"Need you go?\" she asked slowly.\\n\\nHe made no reply--he merely resumed his seat.\\n\\n\"Then you think me a spoilt, pampered, indolent person?\" she continued\\nin the same slow tone as she fixed her eyes upon the window. \"Yet this\\nmuch I know about myself: that I am very unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Unhappy? For what reason? Because you attach too much importance to\\npetty slanders?\"\\n\\nShe frowned. Somehow she felt vexed that he should have understood her\\nthus.\\n\\n\"No; things of that kind do not disturb me,\" she said. \"Never should\\nI allow them to do so--I am too proud. The reason why I am unhappy is\\nthat I have no wish, no enthusiasm, to live. I daresay you will not\\nbelieve me, and will think that a mere \\'petty aristocrat,\\' a person who\\nis lapped in lace and seated in an armchair, is saying all this (and I\\nwill not conceal from you that I love what you call \\'the comforts of\\nlife\\'): yet all the while I feel as though I had no desire to continue\\nmy existence. Pray reconcile that contradiction if you can. But perhaps\\nyou consider what I say \\'Romanticism\\'?\"\\n\\nBazarov shook his head.\\n\\n\"You are yet young,\" he said. \"Also, you are rich and independent. What\\nmore could you have? What more do you desire?\"\\n\\n\"What more?\" she re-echoed with a sigh. \"I do not know. I only know\\nthat I feel tired, antiquated; I feel as though I had been living a\\nlong, long time. Yes, I am growing old,\" she continued as she drew\\nthe ends of her mantilla around her bare shoulders. In doing so, she\\nglanced at Bazarov. Her eyes met his, and the faintest of blushes stole\\ninto her face. \"Behind me lie many memories--memories of my life in St.\\nPetersburg, of a period of wealth followed by poverty, of my father\\'s\\ndeath, of my marriage, of my travels abroad--yes, many such memories\\nthere are. Yet none of them are worth cherishing. And before me lies\\nonly a weary road with no goal to it, along which I have no desire to\\ntravel.\"\\n\\n\"You are disenchanted,\" said Bazarov.\\n\\n\"No,\" she replied with a shiver. \"Rather, I am dissatisfied. Oh that I\\ncould form a strong attachment of some kind!\"\\n\\n\"To fall in love _might_ save you,\" remarked Bazarov. \"But you are\\nincapable of that. That is where your misfortune lies.\"\\n\\nMadame dropped her eyes upon the sleeve of her mantilla.\\n\\n\"I am incapable of falling in love?\" she murmured.\\n\\n\"Not altogether. Moreover, I did wrong to call it a misfortune: for the\\nperson most to be pitied is the person who meets with that experience.\"\\n\\n\"What experience do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"The experience of falling in love.\"\\n\\n\"How come you to know that?\"\\n\\n\"By hearsay,\" he replied irritably, while to himself he added: \"You are\\na mere coquette whom sheer idleness is leading to weary and madden me.\"\\nAnd his heart swelled within him.\\n\\n\"On the other hand,\" he went on, \"it may be that you are too exacting?\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he bent forward and fell to playing with the tassels of his\\nchair.\\n\\n\"Possibly I am,\" she agreed. \"But, you see, I conceive that it ought to\\nbe everything or nothing. \\'A life for a life.\\' \\'Take my all, give your\\nall, and put a truce to regrets and any thought of return.\\' That is the\\nbest rule.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" queried Bazarov. \"Well, it is not a bad rule, and I am\\nsurprised that you should have failed to attain your desire.\"\\n\\n\"Self-surrender, you think, is an easy thing?\"\\n\\n\"Not if one considers matters first, and appraises oneself, and\\nsets upon oneself a definite value. It is only surrender _without_\\nconsideration that is easy.\"\\n\\n\"But how could one not value oneself? If one had value, no one would\\ndesire one\\'s surrender.\"\\n\\n\"That would not be your concern nor mine: some one else\\'s business\\nwould it be to determine our respective values. The one thing that\\nwould immediately concern us would be to know _how_ to surrender.\"\\n\\nMadame Odintsov sat up sharply.\\n\\n\"I still believe you to be speaking from experience,\" she said.\\n\\n\"No; words, idle words--words not meant to be taken personally.\"\\n\\n\"Then you yourself might be capable of surrendering?\"\\n\\n\"I might. But in any case I should not care to boast.\"\\n\\nBoth remained silent for a moment. From the drawing-room came the notes\\nof the piano.\\n\\n\"How late Katia is playing!\" remarked Anna Sergievna.\\n\\nBazarov raised his head.\\n\\n\"Yes, it _is_ late,\" he said. \"Time for you to go to rest.\"\\n\\n\"Wait a moment, however. Why should you hurry away? I have something\\nmore to say to you.\"\\n\\n\"What may it be?\"\\n\\n\"Wait,\" she repeated. As she did so, her eyes gazed at him as though\\nstudying his personality. For a few moments he paced the room--then\\nsuddenly approached her, said \"Good night,\" squeezed her hand until she\\ncould have shrieked with the pain, and departed.\\n\\nRaising her fingers to her lips, she blew after him a kiss. Then,\\nrising with an abrupt, convulsive movement, she ran towards the door\\nas though to call him back. But at that moment her maid entered with\\na decanter on a silver tray, and Madame halted, bid the maid begone,\\nreseated herself, and sank into a reverie. Her hair, like a winding\\nblack snake, had broken loose from its fastenings. Dimly illumined by\\nthe lamp, she sat motionless, save that at intervals she chafed her\\nhands, for the night air was beginning to grow chilly.\\n\\nTwo hours later Bazarov re-entered his bedroom in a state of\\ndishevelment and despondency, and with his boots soaked with dew.\\nArkady was seated, fully dressed, at the writing-table, with a book in\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\"So you are not in bed yet?\" Bazarov remarked irritably.\\n\\nArkady\\'s only reply was to ask the counter-question:\\n\\n\"You have been sitting with Anna Sergievna, have you not?\"\\n\\n\"I have,\" replied Bazarov. \"I was sitting there while you and Katia\\nwere playing the piano.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _I_ was not playing,\" retorted Arkady. Then he stopped, for he\\nfelt the tears to be very near his eyes, and had no wish to let them\\nfall in the presence of his satirical mentor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\n\\nWhen Madame Odintsov entered the breakfast-room next morning, Bazarov\\nhad been sitting over his cup for a considerable time. He glanced\\nsharply at her as she opened the door, and she turned in his direction\\nas inevitably as though he had signed to her to do so. Somehow her face\\nlooked pale, and it was not long before she returned to her boudoir,\\nwhence she issued again only at luncheon time. Since dawn the weather\\nhad been too rainy to admit of outdoor expeditions, and therefore the\\nparty adjourned to the drawing-room, where Arkady began to read aloud\\nthe latest number of some journal, while the Princess manifested her\\nusual surprise at his conduct (as though it had been conduct of an\\nindecent nature!), and fixed upon him a gaze which, though one of\\nlasting malignancy, proved also to be one of which he took not the\\nslightest notice.\\n\\n\"Pray come to my boudoir, Evgenii Vasilitch,\" said Anna Sergievna. \"I\\nhave something to ask you. I think that last night you mentioned some\\ntextbook or another?\"\\n\\nRising, she moved towards the door, whilst the Princess stared around\\nthe room as much as to say: \"Dear, dear! This does surprise me!\" Then\\nshe brought her eyes back to Arkady, who, raising his voice, and\\nbending towards Katia (by whose side he was sitting), continued his\\nreading as before.\\n\\nMeanwhile Madame Odintsov walked hurriedly to her boudoir, and Bazarov\\nfollowed with his eyes fixed upon the floor, and his ears open to\\nno sound but the faint rustling of a silk dress. Arrived at her\\ndestination, Madame seated herself in the chair which she had occupied\\novernight, and Bazarov also took a seat where he had sat on the\\noccasion in question.\\n\\n\"What is the title of the book?\" she asked after a brief pause.\\n\\n\"_Notions Générales_, by Pelouse and Frémy. I can also recommend\\nGanot\\'s _Traité Élémentaire de Physique Expérimentale_, which is more\\ndetailed in its plates than the other work, and, in general, is----\"\\n\\nBut Madame Odintsov held up her hand.\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" she interrupted. \"I have not brought you here to discuss\\ntextbooks. I have brought you here to renew our conversation of last\\nnight, at the point where you left the room so abruptly. I hope that I\\nshall not weary you?\"\\n\\n\"I am entirely at your service. What was it we were discussing?\"\\n\\nShe glanced at him.\\n\\n\"Happiness, I think,\" she said. \"In fact, I was speaking to you of\\nmyself. The reason why I mention happiness is the following. Why is it\\nthat when one is enjoying, say, a piece of music, or a beautiful summer\\nevening, or a conversation with a sympathetic companion, the occasion\\nseems rather a hint at an infinite felicity existent elsewhere than a\\nreal felicity actually being experienced? Perhaps, however, you have\\nnever encountered such a phenomenon?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Where we are not, there do we wish to be,\\'--you know the proverb.\\nLast night you said that you are dissatisfied. Such a thought never\\nenters into my head.\"\\n\\n\"Is it that such thoughts seem to you ridiculous?\"\\n\\n\"No--rather, that they never occur to me.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Well, to know what your thoughts _are_ is a thing which I\\ngreatly wish to attain.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you.\"\\n\\n\"Then listen. For a long time past I have been wishing to have this out\\nwith you. Do not tell me--you yourself know that it is useless to do\\nso--that you are a man apart. As a matter of fact, you are a man still\\nyoung, with all your life before you. I wish to know for what you are\\npreparing, and what future awaits you, and what is the goal which you\\nare seeking to reach, and whither you are travelling, and what you have\\nin your mind--in short, who and what you are.\"\\n\\n\"I am surprised! Already you know that I dabble in natural science;\\nwhile, as regards my future----\"\\n\\n\"Yes? As regards your future?\"\\n\\n\"I have told you that I purpose to become a district physician.\"\\n\\nAnna Sergievna waved her hand impatiently.\\n\\n\"Why tell me that, when you yourself do not believe it? It is for\\nArkady to return me such answers, not you.\"\\n\\n\"And is Arkady in any way----?\"\\n\\n\"Wait. Do you mean to tell me that such a modest rôle will really\\nsatisfy you, when you yourself have asserted that the science of\\nmedicine does not exist? No, no! You have given me that answer for the\\nreason that you desire to keep me at arm\\'s length, that you have no\\nfaith in me. Then let me tell you that I _am_ capable of understanding\\nyou, that I too have known poverty and ambition, that I too have had my\\nexperiences.\"\\n\\n\"I daresay: yet pardon me when I intimate that I am not accustomed to\\nbare my soul. Moreover, there is fixed between you and me such a gulf\\nthat----\"\\n\\n\"A gulf? Do you again say that I am an aristocrat? Come, come, Evgenii\\nVasilitch! Have I not already told you that I----?\"\\n\\n\"Can it avail anything to discuss the future when, for the most part,\\nour futures are wholly independent of ourselves? Should the occasion\\narise to be up and doing, well and good: but, should the occasion _not_\\narise, at least let us leave ourselves room for thankfulness that we\\ndid not waste time in useless chatter.\"\\n\\n\"What? You call a friendly talk \\'useless chatter\\'? Then do you deem me,\\nas a woman, unworthy of your confidence, or do you despise all women?\"\\n\\n\"You I do not despise: and that you know full well.\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing of the kind. Of course I can understand your reluctance\\nto speak of your future career; but as to what is taking place within\\nyou at the present moment----\"\\n\\n\"\\'Taking place within me at the present moment\\'?\" Bazarov exclaimed.\\n\"One would think I was a state or a community! Nor is it a process\\nwhich interests me; while, in addition, a man cannot always put into\\nwords \\'what is taking place within him.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I do not see it. Why should you hesitate to express what may be in\\nyour soul?\"\\n\\n\"Could _you_ do as much?\" asked Bazarov.\\n\\n\"I could,\" came the reply after a brief hesitation.\\n\\nBazarov bowed in an ironical manner.\\n\\n\"Then you have the advantage of me,\" he said.\\n\\nHer glance quickened into a note of interrogation.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"Yet I will venture to say that you and I\\nhave not met in vain, and that we shall always remain good friends.\\nMoreover, I feel certain that in time your secretiveness and reserve\\nwill disappear.\"\\n\\n\"Then have you noticed in me much such \\'secretiveness and reserve\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I have.\"\\n\\nBazarov rose, and moved towards the window.\\n\\n\"Do you really want to know the cause of that \\'secretiveness, and\\nreserve\\'?\" he asked. \"Do you really want to know \\'what is taking place\\nwithin\\' me?\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" she replied. Yet even as she spoke she felt run through her a\\ntinge of apprehension for which she could not account.\\n\\n\"And you will not be angry with me if I tell you?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"No?\"\\n\\nHe approached her and halted behind her.\\n\\n\"Learn, then,\" he said, \"that I love you with a blind, insensate\\npassion. You have forced it from me at last!\"\\n\\nShe stretched out her arms before her, while Bazarov, turning, pressed\\nhis forehead against the window-pane. His breath caught in his throat,\\nand his whole body was quivering. Yet this was not the agitation born\\nof the diffidence of youth, nor was it the awe inspired by a first\\nconfession of love. Rather, it was the beating of a strong and terrible\\nemotion which resembled madness and was, perhaps, akin to it. As for\\nMadame Odintsov, a great horror had come over her--also a great feeling\\nof compassion for him.\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch!\" she cried. In the words there rang an involuntary\\nnote of tenderness.\\n\\nWheeling about, he devoured her with his glance. Then he seized her\\nhands in his, and pressed her to his bosom.\\n\\nShe did not free herself at once. Only after a moment did she withdraw\\nto a corner, and stand looking at him. He rushed towards her again, but\\nshe whispered in hurried alarm:\\n\\n\"You have mistaken me!\"\\n\\nHad he taken another step, she would have screamed.\\n\\nBiting his lips, he left the room.\\n\\nHalf an hour later her maid brought her a note. It consisted of a\\nsingle line only, and said: \"Must I depart to-day, or may I remain\\nuntil to-morrow?\"\\n\\nTo it Anna Sergievna replied: \"Why depart? I have failed to understand\\nyou, and you have failed to understand me--that is all.\"\\n\\nBut mentally she added: \"Rather, I have failed to understand myself.\"\\n\\nUntil dinner time she remained secluded, and spent the hours in pacing\\nher room with her hands clasped behind her. Occasionally she would halt\\nbefore the window-panes or a mirror, to draw a handkerchief across a\\nspot on her neck which seemed to be burning like fire. And every time\\nthat she did so she asked herself what had led her to force Bazarov\\'s\\nconfidence; also, whether or not she had had any suspicion that such a\\nthing might result.\\n\\n\"Yes, I _am_ to blame,\" she finally decided. \"Yet I could not have\\nforeseen the whole _dénouement_.\"\\n\\nThen she recalled Bazarov\\'s almost animal face as he rushed to seize\\nher in his arms. And at the thought she blushed.\\n\\n\"Or is it that----?\" Here she stopped, and shook back her curls. The\\nreason was that she had seen herself in a mirror, and, as in a flash,\\nhad learnt from that image of a head thrown back, with a mysterious\\nsmile lurking between a pair of half-parted lips and in a pair of\\nhalf-closed eyes, something which confounded her.\\n\\n\"No, no! Again no!\" she cried. \"Only God knows what might come of it.\\nSuch things are not to be played with. Freedom from worry is the chief\\nthing in the world.\"\\n\\nNor had her _sangfroid_ really been shattered. Rather, she was a\\nlittle agitated--so little that, when, for some unknown reason, she\\nshed a tear or two, those tears owed their origin not to any deep\\nemotion, to the fact that she was wounded, but to a sense of having\\ninvoluntarily been at fault in permitting certain vague yearnings--a\\ncertain consciousness of the transience of life, a certain desire for\\nnovelty--to urge her towards the boundary line. And over that boundary\\nline she had peeped. And in front of her she had beheld, not an abyss,\\nbut a waste, a sheer ugliness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX\\n\\n\\nIn spite of her self-command, in spite of her superiority to\\nconvention, Madame Odintsov could not but feel a little uncomfortable\\nwhen she entered the dining-room for the evening meal. Nevertheless the\\nmeal passed off without incident, and after it Porphyri Platonitch came\\nin, and related various anecdotes on the strength of a recent visit\\nto the neighbouring town--among other things, a story to the effect\\nthat Governor \"Bardeloue\" had commanded his whole staff of officials\\nto wear spurs, in order that, if need be, he could dispatch them on\\ntheir errands on horseback! Meanwhile, Arkady talked in an undertone\\nto Katia, and also paid diplomatic attention to the Princess; while\\nBazarov maintained such an obstinate, gloomy silence that Madame,\\nglancing at him (as she did twice, and openly, not covertly), thought\\nto herself, as she scanned his stern, forbidding face, downcast eyes,\\nand all-pervading expression of rigid contempt: \"No, no! Again, no!\"\\n\\nDinner over, she conducted her guests into the garden, and, perceiving\\nthat Bazarov desired a word with her, walked aside a little, halted,\\nand waited for him. Approaching with his eyes on the ground, he said in\\na dull way:\\n\\n\"I must beg your pardon, Anna Sergievna. Surely you must be feeling\\nextremely angry with me?\"\\n\\n\"No, not angry so much as grieved,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"So much the worse! But I have received sufficient punishment, have I\\nnot? My position now (I am sure that you will agree with me) is a very\\nawkward one. True, you wrote in your message: \\'Why need you depart?\\'\\nbut I cannot and will not remain. By to-morrow, therefore, I shall have\\ndeparted.\"\\n\\n\"But why need you, need you----?\"\\n\\n\"Why need I depart?\"\\n\\n\"No, I was going to have said something quite different.\"\\n\\n\"We cannot recover the past,\" he continued, \"and it was only a question\\nof time before this should happen. I know only of one condition under\\nwhich I could remain. And that condition is never likely to arise. For\\n(pardon my presumption) I suppose you neither love me now nor could\\never do so?\"\\n\\nWith the words there came a flash from under his dark brows.\\n\\nShe did not reply. Through her brain there flitted only the one\\nthought: \"I am afraid of this man!\"\\n\\n\"Farewell,\" he continued, as though he had divined that thought. Then\\nhe moved away towards the house.\\n\\nEntering the house a little later, Anna Sergievna called to Katia, and\\ntook the girl by the arm: nor throughout the rest of the evening did\\nshe once part from her. Also, instead of joining in a game of cards,\\nshe sat uttering laugh after laugh of a nature which ill consorted with\\nher blanched and careworn face. Gazing at her perplexedly, as a young\\nman will do, Arkady kept asking himself the question: \"What can this\\nmean?\" As for Bazarov, he locked himself in his room, and only appeared\\nto join the rest at tea. When he did so, Anna Sergievna yearned to say\\nsomething kind to him, but could think of no words for the purpose. To\\nher dilemma, however, an unexpected incident put an end. This was the\\nentry of the butler to announce Sitnikov!\\n\\nTo describe the craven fashion in which the young Progressive\\nentered the room would be impossible. Although, with characteristic\\nimportunity, he had decided to repair to the residence of a lady\\nwith whom he was barely acquainted, and who had not accorded him an\\ninvitation (his pretext for such presumption being that, according\\nto information received, she happened to be entertaining guests who\\nwere both intellectual and \"very intimate\" with himself), he had since\\nfelt his courage ebb to the marrow of his bones, and now, instead of\\nproffering all the excuses and compliments which he had prepared in\\nadvance, blurted out some ridiculous story to the effect that Evdoksia\\nKukshin had sent him to inquire after the health of Anna Sergievna,\\nand that Arkady Nikolaievitch had always spoken of him in terms of the\\nhighest respect. But at this point he began to stammer, and so lost his\\nhead as to sit down upon his own hat! No one bade him depart, however,\\nand Anna Sergievna even went so far as to present him to her aunt and\\nsister. Accordingly it was not long before he recovered his equanimity,\\nand shone forth with his accustomed brilliancy. Often the appearance\\nof the paltry represents a convenient phenomenon in life, since it\\nrelaxes over-taut strings, and sobers natures prone to conceit and\\nself-assurance by reminding them of their kinship with the newcomer.\\nThus Sitnikov\\'s arrival caused everything to become duller and a trifle\\nmore futile, but also rendered things simpler, and enabled the company\\nto partake of supper with a better appetite, and to part for the night\\nhalf an hour earlier than usual.\\n\\n\"Let me recall to you some words of your own,\" said Arkady when he had\\ngot into bed, and Bazarov was still undressing. \"I refer to the words:\\n\\'Why are you down-hearted? Have you just fulfilled a sacred duty?\\'\"\\n\\nBetween the two there had become established those half-quizzical\\nrelations which are always a sign of tacit distrust and a smouldering\\ngrudge.\\n\\n\"To-morrow I intend to set out for my father\\'s place,\" remarked\\nBazarov, in disregard of what Arkady had said.\\n\\nThe latter raised himself on his elbow. Though surprised, he also, for\\nsome reason, felt glad.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"Then _that_ is why you are down-hearted?\"\\n\\nBazarov yawned.\\n\\n\"When you are come to be a little older,\" he replied, \"you will know\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"And what of Anna Sergievna?\" continued Arkady.\\n\\n\"Well? What of her?\"\\n\\n\"Is it likely that she will let you go?\"\\n\\n\"I am not her hireling.\"\\n\\nArkady relapsed into thought, and Bazarov sought his bed, and turned\\nhis face to the wall.\\n\\nFor a few moments silence reigned.\\n\\n\"Evgenii,\" said Arkady suddenly.\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"I too intend to leave to-morrow.\"\\n\\nBazarov made no reply.\\n\\n\"True, I shall be returning to Marino,\" continued Arkady, \"but we might\\nbear one another company as far as Khokhlovskïe Viselki, and there you\\ncould hire horses of Thedot. Of course, I should have been delighted to\\nmake your family\\'s acquaintance, but, were I to accompany you, I might\\nact as a source of constraint upon them and yourself alike. You must\\npay us another visit at Marino later.\"\\n\\n\"I will. As a matter of fact, I have left some of my things there.\"\\nBazarov still had his face turned to the wall.\\n\\n\"Why does he not ask _me_ the reason of _my_ departure--a departure as\\nsudden as his?\" reflected Arkady. \"Why is either of us departing, for\\nthat matter?\"\\n\\nAs he continued to reflect he realised that, while unable to return a\\nsatisfactory answer to the question propounded, he seemed to have got\\na heartache somehow, to be feeling that he would find it hard to part\\nwith the life at Nikolsköe to which he was grown so accustomed. Yet he\\ncould not remain there alone. That would be worse still.\\n\\n\"Between him and her there is something in the wind,\" he reflected.\\n\"That being so, what would my sticking here avail after he had gone? I\\nshould weary Anna Sergievna, and lose my last chance of pleasing her.\"\\n\\nThen he began to draw a mental picture of the lady whom he had just\\nnamed: until there cut across the fair presentment of the young widow\\nanother set of features.\\n\\n\"Katia too I shall miss,\" he whispered to his pillow (which had already\\nreceived one of his tears). At length, raising his curly poll, he\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"What, in the devil\\'s name, brought that idiot Sitnikov here?\"\\n\\nHe heard Bazarov stir under the bedclothes, then remark:\\n\\n\"You yourself are an idiot. We need the Sitnikovs of this world. Such\\ndonkeys are absolutely necessary to us, to _me_. The gods ought not to\\nhave to bake pots.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" reflected Arkady. For, as in a flash, there had become revealed\\nto him the bottomless profundity of Bazarov\\'s conceit.\\n\\n\"Then you and I are the gods?\" he said aloud. \"Or are you a god, and I\\na donkey?\"\\n\\n\"You are,\" came the gruff reply. \"As yet, at all events, you are.\"\\n\\nNo particular astonishment was evinced by Madame Odintsov when, on\\nthe following day, Arkady informed her that it was his intention to\\naccompany Bazarov. Rather, she looked distraught and weary. Katia\\nglanced at him gravely and in silence, and the Princess went so far as\\nto cross herself under her shawl--a precaution against the young men\\nobserving the gesture. Sitnikov too was dumbfounded at having just\\nentered the breakfast-room in a new and most elegant suit (this time\\n_not_ of \"Slavophil\" cut, not to mention the fact that he had also had\\nthe pleasure of amazing his temporary valet with the multitude of his\\nshirts), only to find himself confronted with the prospect of being\\ndeserted by his comrades! He shuffled and wriggled like a hare driven\\nto the edge of a covert, and blurted out, almost in panic-stricken\\nfashion, that he too had a great mind to depart. Nor did Madame\\nOdintsov make any great effort to dissuade him.\\n\\n\"I have an exceedingly comfortable _koliaska_,\" the unfortunate young\\nman said to Arkady, \"and I could give you a lift in it, and leave\\nEvgenii Vasilitch to use your _tarantass_, which would suit him better\\nthan the _koliaska_.\"\\n\\n\"But I should not like to take you so far out of your way, for the\\ndistance to my home is considerable.\"\\n\\n\"That would not matter, that would not matter. I have plenty of time to\\nspare, and also some business to do in that direction.\"\\n\\n\"What? Leasehold business again?\" inquired Arkady disparagingly. But\\nSitnikov was so distraught that he forbore to giggle in his usual\\nfashion.\\n\\n\"I can guarantee that the _koliaska_ is comfortable,\" he repeated.\\n\"Indeed, it could hold all three of us.\"\\n\\n\"Do not vex Monsieur Sitnikov by refusing,\" put in Madame Odintsov.\\n\\nSo, with a meaning glance at her, Arkady nodded assent to Sitnikov.\\n\\nBreakfast over, the guests departed. Anna Sergievna offered Bazarov her\\nhand.\\n\\n\"I hope we shall meet again?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Only if you wish it,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"Then we _shall_ meet again.\"\\n\\nThe first to issue upon the verandah and enter Sitnikov\\'s _koliaska_\\nwas Arkady. The butler assisted him obsequiously, although Arkady could\\nwith equal readiness have struck the man or burst into tears. As for\\nBazarov, he took possession of the _tarantass_.\\n\\nKhokhlovskïe Viselki reached, Arkady waited until Thedot, the local\\nposting-master, had harnessed fresh horses, and then, approaching the\\n_tarantass_, said to Bazarov with his old smile:\\n\\n\"Evgenii, take me with you. I should like to come to your place, after\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"Get in, then,\" muttered Bazarov.\\n\\nThis made Sitnikov, who had been walking up and down beside his\\nconveyance, and whistling, fairly gasp. Nevertheless the heartless\\nArkady removed his luggage from the _koliaska_, seated himself beside\\nBazarov, and, according his late fellow-traveller a courteous bow,\\nshouted: \"Right away!\" The _tarantass_ started, and soon was lost to\\nview. Much taken aback, Sitnikov gazed at his coachman. But the latter\\nwas flicking the flanks of the trace horse with his whip, and therefore\\nSitnikov had no choice but to leap into the vehicle, to shout to a\\ncouple of peasants: \"Off with your caps, you rascals!\" and be driven\\nto the town, whither he arrived at a late hour, and where, on the\\nfollowing day, he declared to Madame Kukshin that he had had enough of\\n\"those odious churls and upstarts.\"\\n\\nOn Arkady seating himself beside Bazarov in the _tarantass_, he pressed\\nhis hand, and Bazarov seemed to divine the meaning of the silent\\nhand-clasp, and to appreciate it. During the previous night the elder\\nman had never once closed his eyes. Also, for several days past he had\\nneither smoked a cigar nor eaten more than the merest scrap of food.\\nIndeed, as he sat in the _tarantass_, his fine-drawn profile, under the\\novershadowing cap, looked sharper and grimmer than ever.\\n\\n\"Give me a cigar, will you?\" he said. \"Also, pray look at my tongue,\\nand tell me if it has a bilious appearance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it has,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\n\"I thought so, for this cigar seems tasteless. Moreover, the infernal\\nthing has come unrolled.\"\\n\\n\"You have changed a good deal of late?\" hazarded Arkady.\\n\\n\"I daresay. But I shall be myself again, soon. The only thing now\\ntroubling me is the fact that my mother is so good-naturedly fussy.\\nShould one\\'s paunch not be projecting, or should one not eat at least\\nten meals a day, she relapses into despair. My father, of course, is\\ndifferent, for he has been all over the world, and knows what is what.\\nThis cigar is simply unsmokable.\" And Bazarov consigned it to the dust\\nof the roadway.\\n\\n\"The distance to your place is twenty-five versts, I suppose?\" queried\\nArkady.\\n\\n\"It is so. But inquire of that sage there.\" And Bazarov pointed to the\\npeasant (an _employé_ of Thedot\\'s) who was seated on the box.\\n\\nThe \"sage\" in question replied that he \"could not say exactly,\" since\\nthe verst-posts in those parts had not been measured out; after\\nwhich he went on to swear at the shaft horse for \"kicking\" its \"jowl\\nabout\"--that is to say, jerking its head up and down.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye,\" commented Bazarov. \"Take warning from me, my young friend.\\nAn instructive example sits before you--an example of the vanity of\\nthis world. By a single thread does the destiny of every man hang, and\\nat any moment there may open before him an abyss into which he and his\\nmay plunge. For always he is laying up for himself misfortune.\"\\n\\n\"At what are you hinting?\" asked Arkady.\\n\\n\"At nothing. I am merely saying outright that you and I have behaved\\nvery foolishly. However, why talk of it? I have noticed that in\\nsurgical operations it is the patient who fights against his hurt who\\nsoonest gets well.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you,\" Arkady said. \"So far as I can see, you have\\nnothing whatsoever to complain of.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot understand me? Well, mark this: that you had far better\\ngo and break stones by the roadside than allow a woman to obtain\\neven the least hold over you. Such a thing is sheer\" (he nearly said\\n\"Romanticism,\" but changed his mind) \"rubbish.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you do not believe me?\" he went on. \"Nevertheless, I tell you\\nthat, though you and I have been cultivating feminine society, and\\nenjoying it, the sense of relief when such society is abandoned is like\\ntaking a cold bath on a summer\\'s day. Never ought a man to touch such\\nfollies. Always he ought, as the excellent Spanish saying has it, \\'to\\nremain as the beasts of the field.\\' Look here,\" he added to the peasant\\non the box. \"Do you, my man of wisdom, possess a wife?\"\\n\\nThe peasant turned a portion of a flat, near-sighted visage in the\\nfriends\\' direction.\\n\\n\"A wife?\" he repeated. \"Yes, I do. Why shouldn\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that. Do you ever beat her?\"\\n\\n\"My wife? Sometimes. But never without good cause.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent! And does she ever beat _you_?\"\\n\\nThe peasant gave his reins a jerk.\\n\\n\"What a thing, _barin_!\" he exclaimed. \"Surely you must be joking?\"\\nEvidently the question had offended him.\\n\\n\"You hear that, Arkady Nikolaievitch?\" said Bazarov. \"You and I have\\nbeen similarly beaten. That is what comes of being gentry.\"\\n\\nArkady laughed in spite of himself, but Bazarov turned away, and did\\nnot speak again until the end of the journey.\\n\\nTo Arkady the twenty-five versts seemed like fifty; but at length there\\ncame into view, on the slope of a low hill, the homestead of the manor\\nwhere Bazarov\\'s parents resided. On one side of it, amid a clump of\\nyoung birch trees, there could be seen the servants\\' quarters under\\ntheir thatched roofs; while at the door of the nearest hut a couple of\\nfur-capped peasants were engaged in a contest of mutual abuse.\\n\\n\"You are an old pig!\" one of them said to the other. \"And that is worse\\nthan being a young one.\"\\n\\n\"Your wife is a witch,\" retorted the other.\\n\\n\"From the lack of restraint in their bearing,\" commented Bazarov, \"as\\nwell as from the playfulness of their terms of speech, you will gather\\nthat my father\\'s peasantry are not downtrodden. But here is my father\\nhimself. I can see him stepping out on to the verandah. He will have\\nheard the sound of our collar-bells. Yes, it _is_ he! I recognise his\\nfigure. But how grey he looks, poor old fellow!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX\\n\\n\\nBazarov leant forward from the _tarantass_, and Arkady, peering\\nover his friend\\'s shoulder, beheld, on the entrance steps of the\\nmanor-house, a tall, thin man with dishevelled hair and a narrow,\\naquiline nose. Clad in an old military tunic of which the front was\\nflying open, he was standing with legs apart, a long pipe in his mouth,\\nand eyes blinking in the glare of the sunlight.\\n\\nThe horses pulled up.\\n\\n\"So you have come at last!\" exclaimed Bazarov\\'s father, still\\ncontinuing to smoke (though, as he did so, the stem of the pipe was\\nrattling and shaking between his fingers). \"Now, jump out, jump out!\"\\n\\nAgain and again he embraced his son.\\n\\n\"Eniusha, Eniusha!\"[1] the tremulous voice of an old woman also cried\\nas the door of the house opened and there appeared on the threshold\\na short, rotund old dame in a white cap and a short striped blouse.\\nGasping and staggering, she would have fallen had not Bazarov hastened\\nto support her. As he did so her fat old arms clasped him around the\\nneck, and her head sank upon his bosom. All then was still for a\\nmoment. Only her convulsive sobs broke the silence. Meanwhile Bazarov\\nSenior breathed hard, and blinked more vigorously than ever.\\n\\n\"Enough, enough, Arisha!\" he said at length with a glance at Arkady,\\nwho had remained standing beside the _tarantass_ (and even the peasant\\non the box-seat had turned away his head). \"Pray cease, I tell you.\\nThis is not necessary. I beg of you to cease.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Vasili Ivanitch!\" whimpered the poor old woman. \"To think of the\\nlong while since last I saw my Eniusha, my own, my darling boy!\" Still\\nkeeping her arms clasped around Bazarov, she withdrew her ruffled,\\nconvulsed, tear-stained face from his breast, looked at him for a\\nmoment with blissful, yet comical, eyes, and glued herself again to his\\nbosom.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Vasili Ivanitch. \"Such is in the nature of things. But\\nhad we not better go indoors? See! Evgenii has brought a guest!\"\\n\\nWith a slight scrape and a bow, he added to Arkady:\\n\\n\"Pray pardon us, sir, but you will understand the situation. A woman\\'s\\nweakness--ahem!--and a mother\\'s heart.\"\\n\\nHis lips, chin, and eyebrows too were working. Evidently he was\\nstriving to master himself, and to appear totally indifferent. Arkady\\nresponded to his bow with a like salutation.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, dear mother; let us go indoors,\" said Bazarov. Leading\\nthe shaking old lady into the house, he seated her in a cosy chair,\\nbestowed upon his father another hurried embrace, and then presented\\nArkady.\\n\\n\"I am glad indeed to make your acquaintance!\" said Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\"I am glad indeed! But do not expect too much of us, my dear sir. My\\nestablishment is organised on simple lines; it is placed on what I\\nmight call \\'a war footing.\\' Come, come, Arina! Pray calm yourself, and\\nattend to your duties as a hostess. Oh, fie, to give way in such a\\nmanner! What will our guest think of you?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I do not know the gentleman\\'s name,\" the old lady sobbed\\nthrough her tears.\\n\\n\"Arkady Nikolaievitch,\" prompted Vasili Ivanitch in an undertone, but\\nwith great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Then pray pardon a foolish old woman, sir.\" Arina Vlasievna blew her\\nnose, inclined her head to right and left, and wiped each eye in turn\\nas she did so. \"Yes, pray pardon me, but I had thought never again to\\nsee my darling boy before I died.\"\\n\\n\"But, you see, we _have_ seen him again,\" said Vasili Ivanitch. \"Here,\\nTaniushka!\"--this to a barefooted serf girl of thirteen who, clad in a\\nbright red cotton frock, had been an interested, but timid, observer\\nin the doorway. \"Bring your mistress a glass of water on a salver.\\nDo you hear? And you, gentlemen,\" he continued with old-fashioned\\nsprightliness, \"will you be so good as to step into the study of a\\nretired veteran?\"\\n\\n\"First another kiss, Eniusha,\" gasped Arina Vlasievna. Then, as Bazarov\\nbent over her form, she added: \"How handsome you have grown!\"\\n\\n\"Handsome or not, he is human,\" said Vasili Ivanitch. \"Wherefore, now\\nthat you have satisfied your mother\\'s heart, I look to you to see also\\nto the satisfaction of our honoured guests. For than yourself no one\\nknows better that nightingales cannot be fed on air.\"\\n\\nThis caused the old lady to rise from her chair, and to exclaim:\\n\\n\"Yes, yes: in one moment, Vasili Ivanitch. The table shall be laid, and\\nI myself will hurry to the kitchen, and see that the _samovar_ be got\\nready. Everything shall be done. Why, it must be three years since last\\nI gave Eniusha a meal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, three years, dear wife. But now bustle about, and do not let\\nyourself get flurried. Gentlemen, accompany me, I beg of you. But here\\nis Timotheitch coming to pay you his respects. How delighted he looks,\\nthe old rascal! Now, pray favour me with your company.\"\\n\\nAnd he strode fussily ahead with much shuffling and creaking of\\nflat-soled slippers.\\n\\nThe Bazarovian establishment consisted of six small rooms, of which\\none--the room to which Vasili Ivanitch was now conducting our\\nfriends--was looked upon as the study. Between its two windows there\\nstood a fat-legged table, strewn with dusty, fusty papers; on the walls\\nhung a number of Turkish weapons, _nagaiki_,[2] and swords, a couple\\nof landscapes, a few anatomical plates, a portrait of Hufeland,[3] a\\nblack-framed monogram done in hair, and a diploma protected with a\\nglass front; between two large birchwood cupboards stood a ragged,\\nbattered leathern sofa; on shelves lay huddled a miscellany of books,\\nboxes, stuffed birds, jars, and bladders; and, lastly, in a corner\\nreposed a broken electric battery.\\n\\n\"Already I have warned you,\" said Vasili Ivanitch to Arkady, \"that we\\nlive here, so to speak, _en bivouac_.\"\\n\\n\"Make no excuses,\" put in Bazarov. \"Kirsanov knows that you and I are\\nnot Croesuses, and that no butler is kept. But where can we find Arkady\\na bed? That is the question.\"\\n\\n\"We have an excellent room in the wing, where he would be most\\ncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\"You have added a wing, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Evgenii Vasilitch,\" Timotheitch interposed. \"At least, a\\nbathroom.\"\\n\\n\"But it is to a room _next_ the bathroom that I am referring,\" Vasili\\nIvanitch hastened to explain. \"However, that will not matter, since it\\nis now summer time. I will run up there at once, and see that it is\\nput in order. Meanwhile, Timotheitch, fetch in the luggage. To you,\\nEvgenii, I will allot the study. _Cuique suum._\"[4]\\n\\n\"There!\" said Bazarov to Arkady as soon as his father had left the\\nroom. \"Is he not just such a jolly, good-hearted, queer old fellow as\\nyour own father, though in a different way? He chatters just as he\\nalways used to do.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and your mother seems an excellent woman.\"\\n\\n\"She is. Moreover, you can see that she does not attempt to hide her\\nfeelings. Only wait and see what a dinner she will give us!\"\\n\\n\"But as you were not expected to-day,\" put in Timotheitch, who had just\\nre-entered with Bazarov\\'s portmanteau, \"no beef has been got into the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind. Let us dine _without_ beef--or, for that matter, without\\nanything at all. \\'Poverty is no crime.\\'\"\\n\\n\"How many souls[5] are there on your father\\'s property?\" asked Arkady.\\n\\n\"It is not his property; it is my mother\\'s. The number of souls on it\\nis, I think, fifteen.\"\\n\\n\"No, twenty-two,\" corrected Timotheitch with an air of pride. The next\\nmoment the sound of shuffling slippers was heard once more, and Vasili\\nIvanitch re-entered.\\n\\n\"Your room will be ready for you in a few minutes,\" he announced\\ngrandiloquently to Arkady. \"Meanwhile, here is your servant.\" He\\npointed to a close-cropped urchin who, clad in an out-at-elbows blue\\n_kaftan_ and an odd pair of shoes, had also made his appearance. \"His\\nname is Thedika, and, for all my son\\'s injunction, I had better repeat\\nto you not to expect too much of him--though certainly he will be able\\nto fill your pipe for you. I presume that you smoke?\"\\n\\n\"I do, but only cigars.\"\\n\\n\"A commendable rule! I too prefer cigars, but find them extremely\\ndifficult to procure in this isolated part of the country.\"\\n\\n\"Have done with bewailing your poverty,\" Bazarov good-naturedly\\ninterrupted. \"Rather, seat yourself on this sofa, and take a rest.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch smilingly did as he was bidden. Extremely like his son\\nin features (save that his forehead was lower and narrower, and his\\nmouth a trifle wider), he was for ever on the move--now shrugging his\\nshoulders as though his coat cut him under the armpits, now blinking,\\nnow coughing, now twitching his fingers. In this he was sharply\\ndifferentiated from his son, whose most distinguishing characteristic\\nwas his absolute immobility.\\n\\n\"Have done with bewailing my poverty?\" repeated the old man. \"Why,\\nyou cannot surely think that I would weary our guest with complaints\\nconcerning our isolation? As a matter of fact, a man of brains need\\n_never_ be isolated, and I myself do everything in my power to avoid\\nbecoming moss-grown, and falling behind the times.\"\\n\\nExtracting from his pocket a new yellow handkerchief which he had\\ncontrived to lay hands upon while proceeding to Arkady\\'s room, he\\ncontinued, as he flourished the handkerchief in the air:\\n\\n\"Of the fact that, at some cost to myself, I have organised my\\npeasantry on the _obrok_ system, and apportioned them one-half, even\\nmore, of my land, I will not speak, since I conceive that to have been\\nmy duty, as well as a measure dictated by prudence (though no other\\nlandowner in the neighbourhood would have done as much). Rather, I am\\nreferring to scholarships and to science.\"\\n\\n\"I see that you have here _The Friend of Health_ for 1855,\" remarked\\nBazarov.\\n\\n\"Yes, a friend sent it me,\" Vasili Ivanitch hastened to explain.\\n\"Phrenology too we take into account\" (he addressed this last to Arkady\\nrather than to Bazarov, while accompanying it with a nod towards a\\nsmall plaster bust of which the cranial surface was divided into a\\nseries of numbered squares). \"Yes indeed! Nor are we ignorant of\\nSchönlein[6] and Rademacher.\"\\n\\n\"In the province of ---- you still believe in Rademacher?\" queried\\nBazarov.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch laughed.\\n\\n\"In the province of ---- we still believe in ----? Ah, gentlemen!\\nHardly could you expect us to move as fast as you do. You find us in\\na state of transition. In my day, the humoralist Hoffmann and the\\nvitalist Braun had already come to be looked upon with ridicule (and\\ntheir fulminations undoubtedly seem absurd); but now you have replaced\\nRademacher with a new authority, and are making obeisance to that\\nauthority exactly as though in twenty years\\' time he too will not have\\nfallen into contempt.\"\\n\\n\"Let me tell you, for your comforting,\" said Bazarov, \"that we ridicule\\nall medicine, and render obeisance to no one.\"\\n\\n\"What? Do you not wish to become a doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but the one thing does not preclude the other.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch raked out his pipe until only a glowing morsel of ash\\nremained.\\n\\n\"Perhaps so, perhaps so,\" he said. \"That point I will not dispute.\\nFor who am I that I should dispute such things--I who am a mere\\nretired army doctor, _et voilà tout_--an army doctor who has taken to\\nagriculture?\"\\n\\nWith that he turned to Arkady.\\n\\n\"Do you know, I served under your grandfather,\" he said. \"He was then\\nin command of a brigade. Many and many a review have I seen. And the\\nsociety in which I mixed, the men whom I had as comrades! Yes, this\\nhumble individual has felt the pulses of Prince Vitzentschein and\\nZhukovsky, and also known all the leaders of the Southern Army of \\'14.\"\\nHe pursed his lips impressively. \"At the same time, of course, my\\ndepartment was a separate one from theirs. It was the department of the\\nlancet, you understand. Your grandfather stood high in the esteem of\\nevery one, and was a true soldier.\"\\n\\n\"We will agree that he was a decent old curmudgeon,\" drawled Bazarov.\\n\\n\"To think of speaking so, Evgenii!\" exclaimed the old man. \"General\\nKirsanov was not one of those who----\"\\n\\n\"Never mind him. As we were driving hither I greatly admired your birch\\nplantation. It is doing splendidly.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch\\'s face brightened instantly.\\n\\n\"Yes, and see what a garden I have made!\" he exclaimed. \"Every tree in\\nit has been planted with my own hands--orchard trees, and bush fruit\\ntrees, and every sort of medicinal herb. Ah, young sirs, though you may\\nbe wise in your generation, many a truth did old Paracelsus[7] discover\\n_in herbis et verbis et lapidibus_. For myself, I have now retired from\\npractice; yet twice a week am I given a chance to refurbish my ancient\\nstore of knowledge, since folk come to me for advice, and I cannot well\\nturn them away. In particular do the poor seek my help, since there is\\nno other doctor hereabouts. Yet stay! A certain retired major dabbles\\nin the art. Once I asked him whether he had ever _studied_ medicine,\\nand he replied that he had not, that all that he did he did \\'out of\\nphilanthropy\\'! \\'Out of philanthropy\\'! Ha, ha, ha! What think you of\\nthat, eh? Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"Fill me a pipe, Thedika,\" said Bazarov curtly.\\n\\n\"And there was another doctor who came to visit a patient in this\\nneighbourhood,\" continued Vasili Ivanitch in a tone of mock despair.\\n\"But by the time he arrived the patient had already joined his\\nforefathers, and the servant of the house would not admit the doctor,\\nsaying that the latter\\'s services were no longer required. This the\\ndoctor had scarcely expected, and he was rather taken aback. \\'Did the\\n_barin_ gasp before he died?\\' he inquired. \\'He did, sir,\\' was the\\nreply. \\'Very much?\\' \\'Yes, very much.\\' \\'Good!--And the doctor returned\\nhome. Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nYet no one laughed except the old man himself. True, Arkady contrived\\nto summon up a smile, but Bazarov only stretched himself and yawned.\\nThe conversation lasted about an hour, and then Arkady managed to\\nget away to his room, which he found to consist of the vestibule to\\nthe bathroom, but at the same time to be clean and inviting. Soon\\nafterwards Taniushka arrived to announce dinner.\\n\\nThe meal, though hastily prepared, was excellent, and even sumptuous.\\nOnly the wine proved to be rather of the \"gooseberry\" order--the\\ndark-coloured sherry procured by Timotheitch from a certain wine\\nmerchant in the town smacking in equal parts of resin and of honey.\\nAlso, in addition, the flies made themselves a nuisance, owing to the\\nfact that the page boy whose duty it was to keep them at bay with a\\ngreen whisk had, for the nonce, been banished, lest he should excite\\ntoo much comment on the part of the up-to-date visitors. Lastly, Arina\\nVlasievna had robed herself in gala attire--that is to say, in a\\nhigh-peaked cap with yellow ribands and a blue, embroidered shawl. She\\nburst into renewed weeping on beholding her beloved Eniusha, but, this\\ntime, gave her husband no occasion to chide her, so speedily did her\\nown fear of staining her shawl cause her to wipe away the tears. None\\nbut the two young men ate anything, for the host and hostess had long\\nago dined; while as waiters there officiated Thedika (much burdened\\nwith the novelty of wearing shoes) and a woman of a masculine type of\\nface, and with a hump on her back, who was also accustomed to execute\\nthe functions of housekeeper, keeper of the poultry, and sempstress.\\nDuring the meal Vasili Ivanitch paced to and fro, and discussed,\\nin cheerful, and even rapturous, terms, the grave fears which\\nNapoleon\\'s[8] policy and the intricacy of the Italian question inspired\\nin his breast. Arina Vlasievna, for her part, quite disregarded Arkady,\\nand offered him not a single dish, but, seated with her hand supporting\\nher face (to which a pair of puffy, cherry-coloured lips and a few\\nmoles communicated a kindly expression), kept her eyes fixed upon her\\nson, while her breath came in a succession of pants. Her great desire\\nwas to ask her son how long he was going to stay, but she dared not\\ndo so for fear he should reply: \"Only for two days,\" or something\\nof the kind--which was a prospect of a nature to make her heart die\\nwithin her. On the roast being served, Vasili Ivanitch disappeared, and\\nreturned, the next moment, with an uncorked bottle of champagne.\\n\\n\"See here,\" he exclaimed. \"Rustic though we may be, we still keep\\nsomething to make merry with on state occasions.\"\\n\\nThat said, he filled three tumblers and a wine-glass, proposed a health\\nto \"our inestimable guests,\" heel-tapped his glass in the military\\nfashion, and forced his wife to drain hers to the dregs. Presently the\\npastry course supervened; during which, though Arkady could not bear\\nanything sweet, he deemed it his duty to partake of no less than four\\nout of the many confections which had been prepared for his benefit.\\nAnd this obligation he felt to be the more binding in that Bazarov\\nbluntly declined all, and lit a cigar. Lastly there appeared tea,\\ncream, biscuits, and butter; after which Vasili Ivanitch conducted the\\nparty into the garden, in order that the guests might admire the beauty\\nof the evening. As he passed a certain bench he whispered in Arkady\\'s\\near:\\n\\n\"This is where I love to sit and meditate as I watch the sun sinking.\\nIt is just the spot for a hermit like myself. And, further on, I have\\nplanted a few of Horace\\'s favourite trees.\"\\n\\n\"What trees?\" asked Bazarov, who had partially overheard.\\n\\n\"Acacia trees.\"\\n\\nThe other yawned, and, on observing this, Vasili Ivanitch hastened to\\nsay:\\n\\n\"I expect that you travellers would like now to seek the arms of\\nMorpheus?\"\\n\\n\"We should,\" Bazarov assented. \"Yes, that is a true saying.\"\\n\\nUpon which the son said \"Good night\" to his mother, and kissed her\\non the forehead, while she bestowed upon him a threefold embrace and\\n(covertly) a blessing; while Vasili Ivanitch conducted Arkady to his\\nroom, and wished him \"such God-given rest as I myself used to enjoy\\nduring the happier years of my life.\"\\n\\nAnd certainly Arkady slept splendidly in the mint-scented annexe to\\nthe bathroom, where the only sound to be heard was that of a cricket\\nchirping lustily against a rival from behind the stove.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on leaving Arkady, Vasili Ivanitch repaired to the study,\\nwhere, squatting at the foot of the sofa, he was about to enter into a\\ndiscursive conversation with his son when the latter dismissed him, on\\nthe plea that he desired, rather, to go to sleep. Yet never once did\\nBazarov close his eyes that night, but lay staring into the darkness,\\nsince his memories of childhood had less power to move him than had\\nthe remembrance of the bitter experience through which he had recently\\npassed.\\n\\nFor her part, Arina Vlasievna said her prayers with an overflowing\\nheart, and then indulged in a long talk with Anfisushka; who, planted\\nlike a block before her mistress, with her solitary eye fixed upon\\nthe latter, communicated in a mysterious whisper her opinions and\\nprognostications on the subject of Evgenii Vasilitch. Finally Arina\\nVlasievna\\'s pleasurable emotion, coupled with the wine and the tobacco\\nsmoke, so caused the old lady\\'s head to start whirling that, when\\nher husband came to bed, he found himself obliged to moderate her\\nexuberance with a gesture.\\n\\nArina Vlasievna was a true Russian housewife of the old school. That\\nis to say, she ought to have lived a couple of hundred years earlier,\\nduring the period when the ancient Muscovite Empire was in being.\\nAt once pious and extremely nervous, she believed in every species\\nof portent, divination, proverb, and vision; also in such things as\\n_urodivïe_,[9] household demons, wood spirits, unlucky encounters,\\nspells, popular medicines, Thursday salt, and an ever-imminent end\\nto the world. Again, she placed much faith in such ideas as that, if\\na lighted candle lasts through the night preceding Easter Day, the\\nbuckwheat crops will come up well; that, should a human eye chance to\\nfall upon a mushroom during the process of its growth, such growth\\nwill terminate forthwith; that the devil loves to be where-soever\\nthere is water; and that all Jews bear on their breasts a blood-red\\nstain. Again, she stood in great awe of mice, adders, frogs, sparrows,\\nleeches, thunder, cold water, draughts, horses, billy-goats, fair\\nmen, and black cats, and also looked upon crickets and dogs as\\nunclean creatures. Again, she never ate veal, pigeons, crabs, cheese,\\nasparagus, artichokes, hare, or water melons (the last-named for the\\nreason that, when split open, they reminded her of the head of John\\nthe Baptist!). Nor could she ever speak of oysters without a shudder.\\nAgain, though she loved eating, she observed every fast; though she\\nslept ten hours out of the twenty-four, she never even went to bed if\\nVasili Ivanitch had got a headache; she read no books beyond _Alexis_\\nor _Siskins of the Forest_; she wrote, at most, two letters a year; she\\nknew every wrinkle as regards the departments of housekeeping, boiling,\\nand baking (and that even though she herself never laid a finger upon\\nanything, and hated even to have to stir from her place); she was\\naware that there were certain folk in the world who must command, and\\nothers who must serve--wherefore she loved servility and genuflexions;\\nshe treated all her subordinates with kindness and consideration; she\\nsent never a beggar away empty; and she condemned no one for a fault,\\nalthough at times she had a tendency to talk scandal. Likewise, in\\nher youth she had been comely, and a player of the clavichord, and\\nable to speak a little French; but, owing to long residence with a\\nhusband whom she had married purely for love, she had grown rusty in\\nthose accomplishments, and forgotten alike her French and her music;\\nshe loved and feared her son to a degree almost beyond expression; she\\ndeputed the management of her property entirely to Vasili Ivanitch, and\\nnever interfered with it, but would fall to gasping, and waving her\\nhandkerchief about, and affrightedly raising her eyebrows, whenever\\nher helpmeet happened to broach some new plan or some necessary reform\\nwhich he had in his mind\\'s eye; and, lastly, she was of so apprehensive\\na temperament that she lived in constant fear of some unknown\\nmisfortune, and would burst into tears should any one mention anything\\nof a mournful character.\\n\\nSuch women are now extinct; and only God knows whether we ought to be\\nglad of the fact.\\n\\n\\n[1] An endearing diminutive of Evgenii.\\n\\n[2] Cossack whips.\\n\\n[3] Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762-1836), a well-known German\\nphysicist whose treatise _Makrobiotik_, or _The Art of Prolonging\\nLife_, has been translated into almost every European language.\\n\\n[4] \"To each his own.\"\\n\\n[5] _i.e._ serfs.\\n\\n[6] Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793-1864), a noted German physician.\\n\\n[7] Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493-1541), most commonly\\nknown by his self-coined name of Paracelsus, and a German-Swiss\\ntraveller and physician.\\n\\n[8] Napoleon III.\\n\\n[9] _Urodivïe_, or \"sacred imbeciles,\" were persons who, deficient of\\nintellect in the ordinary sense, were yet believed by ancient Russia\\nto enjoy particularly intimate communication with the divine and the\\nunseen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen, in the morning, Arkady rose and opened the window, the first\\nobject to greet his eyes was Vasili Ivanitch. Clad in a smock-frock,\\nand belted with a handkerchief, the old man was busily digging in his\\nvegetable garden. As soon as he noticed his young guest, he leaned upon\\nhis spade, and cried:\\n\\n\"Good morning! How have you slept?\"\\n\\n\"Splendidly,\" replied Arkady.\\n\\n\"And I, as you see, am imitating Cincinnatus, and preparing a bed of\\nlate turnips. By the mercy of God do the times compel every man to\\nwin his bread with his own hands. At all times, indeed, is it useless\\nto rely upon others: it is best to work oneself. Thus Jean Jacques\\nRousseau was right. Half an hour ago, however, you would have seen me\\nin a very different rôle--first of all, injecting opium into a woman\\nwho had come to me with what the peasants call I the goad,\\' and we\\ndysentery, and then pulling out some teeth for a second woman. And,\\nwould you believe it, when I proposed administering ether to the second\\nwoman she would have none of it! These things I do gratis, you know,\\nand as an amateur. Yet, let that not surprise you, for, after all, I am\\nbut a plebeian, but a _homo novus_. Come downstairs to sit in the shade\\nand enjoy the freshness of the morning until breakfast shall be ready.\"\\n\\nArkady did as invited.\\n\\n\"You confer a favour upon me,\" said Vasili Ivanitch, raising his hand\\nin military fashion to the battered skull-cap which adorned his head.\\n\"You see, I know you to be used to luxury and ease. Yet even the folk\\nof the great world need not disdain to snatch a brief respite under the\\nroof of a cottage.\"\\n\\n\"I neither belong to the great world nor am used to luxury,\" protested\\nArkady.\\n\\n\"Come now!\" Vasili Ivanitch indulged in an amiable affectation of\\nincredulity. \"I myself, though I am now on the shelf, have rubbed about\\nin my time, and can tell a bird by its flight. Also, I dabble a little\\nin physiognomy and psychology. For that matter, I will not hesitate\\nto say that, had I _not_ enjoyed those advantages, I should long ago\\nhave come to rack and ruin, for the reason that, being one of the small\\nfry, I should soon have been jostled out of the way by the crowd. Also,\\nwithout flattery, I may say that the friendship which I discern to\\nbe existing between you and my son affords me the greatest pleasure.\\nOnly this moment I was speaking to him; for (as probably you know) he\\njumps out of bed at a very early hour, and goes careering all over the\\ncountryside. M-might I make so bold as to ask you whether you have\\nknown him long?\"\\n\\n\"Only since last winter.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Also, might I make so bold as to ask whether--But sit you\\ndown, will you not?--might I also, as his father, venture to ask your\\nfrank opinion of him?\"\\n\\n\"Your son is the most remarkable man that I have ever met,\" came the\\nenthusiastic reply.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch\\'s eyes closed suddenly, while his cheeks quivered, and\\nthe spade slipped from his hand.\\n\\n\"Then you think?\" he began.\\n\\n\"I do not _think_--I am certain that there lies before your son a\\nfuture which will make your name famous. I have felt certain of this\\nsince the first moment I met him.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Indeed?\" Vasili Ivanitch could scarcely articulate the words,\\nbut on his capacious lips there had dawned, and become fixed, a smile\\nof triumph.\\n\\n\"Would you like to hear how our first meeting came about?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I should! And any other details you like.\"\\n\\nArkady therefore plunged into a discourse on Bazarov of the same ardour\\nand the same enthusiasm as he had displayed on the night of the mazurka\\nwith Madame Odintsov. As Vasili Ivanitch listened, he blew his nose,\\nrolled his handkerchief into a ball, coughed, and ruffled his hair;\\nuntil, no longer able to contain himself, he reached over in Arkady\\'s\\ndirection, and pressed his lips to the young man\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"You have indeed cheered my heart!\" he exclaimed, still smiling. \"I\\nsimply idolise my son! But while my dear old wife is able to stand\\non rather a different footing with Evgenii--she is his mother, you\\nknow--I myself dare not express my whole feelings in his presence,\\nfor the reason that he dislikes such things, and is opposed to any\\nmanifestations of emotion. For the same reason some folk accuse him of\\nhardness of heart and pride and insensibility; but men like Evgenii\\ncannot be measured by ordinary standards, can they? For example, any\\none but he would have gone on acting as a drag upon his parents; but,\\nwould you believe it? never once since his birth has he asked us for a\\n_kopeck_ more than he absolutely needed! There, by God!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, your son is a sincere, single-minded man,\" agreed Arkady.\\n\\n\"Yes, single-minded,\" affirmed Vasili Ivanitch. \"And not only do I\\nidolise him--I am proud of him, and have as my one conceit the hope\\nthat some day there may stand in his biography the following words: \\'He\\nwas the son of a plain military doctor who, nevertheless, had the wit\\nto divine the merits of the subject of this book, and to spare no pains\\nin his education.\\'\"\\n\\nThe old man\\'s voice faltered for a moment, but presently resumed:\\n\\n\"What think you? Will the field of medicine bring him the fame which\\nyou have foretold?\"\\n\\n\"Not the field of medicine alone--though in it, as elsewhere, he will\\nbecome a leader.\"\\n\\n\"What field, then, Arkady Nikolaievitch?\"\\n\\n\"I could not say. But in any case he will rise to fame.\"\\n\\n\"\\'He will rise to fame\\'!\" The old man relapsed into a state of ecstatic\\ncontemplation.\\n\\nPresently Anfisushka arrived with a large plate of raspberries and the\\nmessage:\\n\\n\"Arina Vlasievna has sent me to say that breakfast is ready.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch started from his reverie.\\n\\n\"Bring us also some nice cool plums,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I will, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, mind that they are cool. Arkady Nikolaievitch, do not stand on\\nceremony, but help yourself. Is Evgenii Vasilitch yet back, Anfisushka?\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" called Bazarov from Arkady\\'s room.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch wheeled about.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he cried. \"So you have gone to pay your friend a visit? But you\\nare too late, _amice_: he and I have been having a long conversation\\ntogether, and it is now breakfast time, and your mother is calling us.\\nBy the way, Evgenii, a word or two with you.\"\\n\\n\"Concerning what?\"\\n\\n\"Concerning a peasant who is suffering from jaundice.\"\\n\\n\"Jaundice?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of a very chronic and stubborn kind. I have prescribed scurvy\\ngrass and St. John\\'s wort, and ordered the man to eat carrots, and\\ngiven him a dose of soda; but such things are mere palliatives--I want\\nsomething of a more drastic nature. That you laugh at medicine I am,\\nof course, aware; but none the less I feel certain that you could give\\nme some good, practical advice. But that you can do later. At the\\npresent moment, let us go in to breakfast.\"\\n\\nAnd he leapt from the bench on which he had been seated, trolling gaily\\nthe couplet:\\n\\n    \"Let us take for our rule, for our rule let us take it,\\n    To live but for pleasure, and never forsake it!\"\\n\\n\"What high spirits!\" Bazarov remarked as he retired from the window.\\n\\nLater, when the noontide sun was glowing from behind a thin canopy of\\ndense, pale vapour, and all was still save that the chirping of a few\\nbirds in the trees lulled the hearer to a curious, drowsy lethargy, and\\nthe incessant call of a young hawk on a topmost bough made the air ring\\nwith its strident note, Arkady and Bazarov made for themselves pillows\\nof sweet, dry, fragrant, crackling hay, and stretched themselves in the\\nshadow of a rick.\\n\\n\"Do you see that aspen tree?\" remarked Bazarov. \"I mean the one growing\\nat the edge of a depression, where a brick kiln used to stand? Well,\\nwhen I was a boy I used to believe that, together, the depression and\\nthe aspen tree constituted a special talisman, in that, when near them,\\nI never found time hang heavy upon my hands. Of course, the explanation\\nis that in those days I failed to understand that that immunity from\\n_ennui_ was due to the very fact of my being a boy. But, now that I am\\ngrown up, the talisman seems to have lost its power.\"\\n\\n\"How long were you here in those days?\"\\n\\n\"Only two years. After that we moved elsewhere. In fact, we led a\\nwandering life, and spent it mostly in towns.\"\\n\\n\"Is the house an old one?\"\\n\\n\"It is. My maternal grandfather built it.\"\\n\\n\"Who was he?\"\\n\\n\"The devil only knows! I think a major of some sort, a man who had\\nserved under Suvorov,[1] and could tell all manner of tales about\\ncrossing the Alps--though I daresay he told plenty of lies too.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! I noticed a portrait of Suvorov in the drawing-room.\\nCheerful-looking old houses like this I simply love. Somehow they seem\\nto have a smell of their own.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--a smell of lamp-oil mingled with trefoil,\" agreed Bazarov with a\\nyawn. \"But what flies they contain as well!\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. Then Arkady resumed:\\n\\n\"Were you strictly kept when you were a boy?\"\\n\\n\"You have seen for yourself what my parents are like. Surely they do\\nnot seem very severe folk.\"\\n\\n\"And do you love them very much?\"\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly they seem to love _you._\"\\n\\nBazarov was silent. Presently, however, clasping his hands behind his\\nhead, he asked:\\n\\n\"Do you know what is in my mind?\"\\n\\n\"No. What?\"\\n\\n\"I am thinking of the pleasant life that my parents must lead. To\\nthink that at sixty my father can still fuss about, and talk of\\n\\'palliatives,\\' and doctor people, and do the bountiful to the peasants,\\nand, in short, enjoy himself, and that my mother has her days so\\ncrammed full of occupations (including sighing and groaning) that she\\ndoes not know which to begin upon first! On the other hand, _I_----\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you?\"\\n\\n\"Am doing what you see--lying under a rick. The space occupied by my\\nbody is small indeed compared with the surrounding immensity in which\\nit has neither part nor lot, and the portion of time allotted to me\\nhere on earth is insignificant indeed compared with the eternity\\nwhich I have never known, and shall never enter! Yet in this same\\natom, in this same mathematical point which I call my body, the blood\\ncirculates, and the brain operates at will. A fine discrepancy for\\nyou--a fine futility!\"\\n\\n\"I would remark that what you have just said applies to every human\\nbeing in creation.\"\\n\\n\"True. What I mean is that my parents know not a single tedious\\nmoment, nor are in the least distressed with the thought of their\\ninsignificance--it is a thought which never stinks in their nostrils;\\nwhereas _I_--well, I feel nothing but weariness and rancour in my\\nbreast.\"\\n\\n\"Rancour? Why rancour?\"\\n\\n\"How can you ask? Have you forgotten the recent past?\"\\n\\n\"No: only, I do not recognise your right to be _angry_: unhappy,\\nperhaps, but not----\"\\n\\n\"I perceive you to understand love as it is understood by all our\\nmodern young men. That is to say, chirping \\'Tsip, tsip, tsip!\\'\\nlike pullets, you take to your heels as soon as ever you see love\\napproaching. I, however, am different.--But enough of this. What is\\npast help is best not talked about.\" Bazarov rolled over on to his\\nelbow. \"Ah! Here is a young ant towing in its wake a half-dead fly.\\nPull, brother, pull! Never mind that the fly hangs back, but avail\\nyourself of your animal right to abjure all sympathy, seeing that our\\nfriend has only himself to thank for his trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Do not speak like that,\" expostulated Arkady. \"How are you yourself to\\nthank for your trouble?\"\\n\\nBazarov raised his head.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"I was but jesting. Never have I got myself into\\ntrouble, and never shall any woman do it for me. Amen! I have spoken.\\nNever will you hear from me another word on the subject.\"\\n\\nFor a while the two friends lay without speaking.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued Bazarov, \"man is a strange being. Contemplating from\\na distance the dull life led by my parents, one would almost feel\\ninclined to say to oneself: \\'What could be better than that, seeing\\nthat in that existence one merely eats and drinks and knows oneself to\\nbe acting in a sane and regular manner?\\' Yet a man will still become\\ndepressed, and yearn for company, even though he may curse it when he\\nhas got it.\"\\n\\n\"One ought so to order one\\'s life that every moment in it shall be of\\nsignificance,\" said Arkady sententiously.\\n\\n\"Of course; but while the significant, and even the\\npseudo-significant--yes, the absolutely insignificant as well--may be\\nbearable, it is trifles, trifles that matter.\"\\n\\n\"Unless a man recognise their existence, they do not exist.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! A contra-platitude.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"This--that, should you say that education is useful, you will be\\nuttering a platitude; but, should you say that education is harmful,\\nyou will be uttering a contra-platitude. The one is identical with the\\nother, except that they differ a little in elegance of expression.\"\\n\\n\"And which has right on its side?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Which has right on its side?\\' I can only re-echo: \\'Which?\\'\"\\n\\n\"Come! You are out of spirits to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Am I? Then the sun must have touched me a little, or else I must have\\neaten too many raspberries to be good for me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would do well to have a sleep.\"\\n\\n\"I think you are right. Only, do not look at me while I sleep, for a\\nman cuts his very worst figure at such a time.\"\\n\\n\"Surely _you_ do not care for people\\'s opinion?\"\\n\\n\"I do, even though a man in the best sense of the term ought never to\\ntrouble his head about such things, seeing that such a man is either\\nabove criticism or too feared and hated for critics to wish to tackle\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Curious! For I myself never hate any one.\"\\n\\n\"And I hate a great many people. You, you see, are a tender soul,\\nyou are so much pap, and therefore hatred could never come within\\nyour purview. People as retiring, as devoid of self-confidence as you\\nare----\"\\n\\n\"What about your own self-confidence?\" interrupted Arkady. \"What about\\nyour own opinion of yourself?\"\\n\\nBazarov paused--then replied:\\n\\n\"As we were passing the hut of your _starosta_ to-day (what a neat,\\npretty little place it looked!) you said to me: \\'Not until every\\npeasant shall have come to own such a place as this, and every one of\\nus shall have contributed his mite to that end, will Russia attain\\nperfection.\\' But, for my part, I abominate the scurvy churl for whom\\nI am supposed to jump out of my skin, even though never a \\'thank you\\'\\nshould I get from him for doing so. For why should he thank me? His\\n_métier_ happens to be living in a white hut, and mine to be----\"\\n\\n\"Come, come, Evgenii! One is almost forced to agree with those who\\naccuse us of being unprincipled.\"\\n\\n\"You talk like your uncle. No such thing as principle exists. That\\nyou seem never to have divined. Instincts only exist, and upon them\\neverything depends.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"Thus. We will take myself as an example. Owing to the nature of my\\ninstincts, I am prone to deny--I am prone to deny because my brain\\nis so constituted. In the same way, if you were to ask me why I am\\ninterested in chemistry, and why you like apples, I should reply that\\nthe same reason holds good in each case--that our respective instincts\\nare what they are. In other words, there exists between your instincts\\nand mine a certain affinity. Deeper it is not given us to probe.\"\\n\\n\"Then is honour an instinct?\"\\n\\n\"It is.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Evgenii!\" cried Arkady sorrowfully.\\n\\n\"Do you dislike the conversation? Then let us philosophise no more, but\\n\\'permit nature to waft upon us the silence of sleep,\\' to quote Pushkin.\"\\n\\n\"Pushkin never said any such thing,\" objected Arkady.\\n\\n\"Then, if he did not, he ought, being a poet, to have done so. Perhaps\\nhe had served in the army?\"\\n\\n\"Never did he serve in the army.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Why, in his every line we come across \\'To battle, to battle,\\nfor the honour of Russia!\\'\"\\n\\n\"That is a mere invention on your part. The statement is an absolute\\ncalumny.\"\\n\\n\"A calumny? What matters a calumny? What is there in the term to be\\nafraid of? Slander a man as much as you like, yet for himself he will\\nhear things twenty times worse.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose we sleep,\" said Arkady irritably.\\n\\n\"With pleasure,\" Bazarov replied.\\n\\nNevertheless neither succeeded in the effort, for almost every\\nsleep-destroying sentiment happened to be in the ascendant. So, after\\nfive minutes of such ineffectual striving, both opened their eyes, and\\nlay mutely gazing about then.\\n\\n\"Look!\" cried Arkady after a pause. \"Do you see that withered maple\\nleaf fluttering to the ground? Are not its movements exactly like those\\nof a butterfly? Strange that an object so joyous and full of life\\nshould be able so to counterfeit an object mournful and dead!\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" protested Bazarov, \"let me make at least _this_ request of\\nyou: that you do not talk in \\'beautiful language.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I talk as I am able. I decline to be domineered over. Should a thought\\nchance to enter my head, why should I not express it?\"\\n\\n\"Similarly am I at liberty to express the thought that to talk in\\n\\'beautiful language\\' is sheerly indecent.\"\\n\\n\"Indecent? Then swearing is _not_ indecent?\"\\n\\n\"Aha! I perceive you still to be minded to follow in your uncle\\'s\\nfootsteps. How the idiot would have rejoiced if he could have heard\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"_What_ did you call Paul Petrovitch?\"\\n\\n\"I called him merely what he is--merely an idiot.\"\\n\\n\"Have done!\" shouted Arkady.\\n\\n\"Therein I detect the tie of blood,\" said Bazarov calmly. \"It is a\\nvery stubborn factor, I have noticed, in some people. A man may abjure\\neverything else, and cut himself adrift from every other prejudice,\\nyet still remain powerless to confess that the brother who habitually\\nsteals his shirts is a thief. You see, the difficulty lies in the word\\n\\'my.\\' Is not that so?\"\\n\\n\"No. It was from a sense of justice, rather than from a sense of\\nkinship, that I spoke. But since you have no understanding of the\\nformer, as an instinct which you simply do not possess, you are not in\\na position to pass judgment upon such a feeling.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, \\'I, Arkady Kirsanov, am altogether above your\\ncomprehension,\\' Well, I make mute obeisance to that.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come, Evgenii! We shall end by quarrelling.\"\\n\\n\"Oh that you _would_ do me the favour to quarrel! We could have a real\\nset-to _à outrance_, and with our coats off.\"\\n\\n\"To the end that----?\"\\n\\n\"To the end that we might rend one another in pieces. Why not? Here,\\namid the hay, in this idyllic setting, far from the madding crowd and\\nevery human eye, it would be not at all a bad thing. No, you shall\\n_not_ make it up with me! Rather will I seize you by the throat!\"\\n\\nAs he extended his long, sharp fingers, Arkady rolled over and prepared\\njestingly to grapple with his assailant. But the next moment the sight\\nof Bazarov\\'s face, with its expression of malice and the non-jesting\\nmenace which lurked in the twisted smile and the flashing eyes, gave\\nhim a shock, and filled him with involuntary awe.\\n\\n\"_This_, then, is where you have got to!\" cried Vasili Ivanitch from\\nbehind them as, vested in a home-made cotton pea-jacket and a home-made\\nstraw hat, the old military doctor suddenly confronted the pair. \"I\\nhave been searching for you everywhere, and certainly you have chosen\\na capital spot, and are engaged also in a capital occupation--in the\\noccupation of lying on the earth and gazing at the heavens. For my\\npart, I believe that such an occupation can have its uses.\"\\n\\n\"I gaze at the heavens only when I am going to sneeze,\" said Bazarov.\\nThen, turning to Arkady, he added in an undertone: \"Forgive me if I\\nhurt you.\"\\n\\n\"Do not mention it,\" was Arkady\\'s rejoinder in a similar undertone, as\\ncovertly he pressed his friend\\'s hand.\\n\\nShocks of such a kind, however, were bound, in time, to react upon\\ntheir friendship.\\n\\n\"As I look at you, young gentlemen,\" Vasili Ivanitch continued as,\\nnodding his head, he rested his hands upon a crooked stick, his\\nown manufacture, which had a Turk\\'s head for a handle, \"I cannot\\nsufficiently admire you. What strength you embody! How you speak of\\nthe flower of youth, of capacity, and of talent! You resemble Castor\\nand Pollux themselves.\"\\n\\n\"To think of your flaunting your mythology like that!\" said Bazarov.\\n\"At the same time, you must have been a fine Latin scholar in your day.\\nIn fact, did not you once receive a silver medal for an essay?\"\\n\\n\"The Dioscuri, the Dioscuri themselves!\" continued the old man\\necstatically.\\n\\n\"Come, come, father! Do not play the fool,\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well! No, I have not sought you out to pay you compliments: I have\\ncome to inform the pair of you that dinner is nearly ready, and also to\\ngive you, Evgenii, a warning. I know that, as a man of sense, as well\\nas a man well versed in the world, you will be charitable. The case\\nis this. This morning your mother took it into her head to organise a\\nthanksgiving ceremony on the occasion of your return.--No, do not think\\nthat I am inviting you to the ceremony: on the contrary, it is over.\\nAll that I am going to say is that Father Alexis----\"\\n\\n\"The priest?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and our private confessor. Well, this Father Alexis is going\\nto dine with us, even though I had not expected it, and it was\\nnot my suggestion, but merely an arrangement which has come about\\nsomehow--probably through his having failed to understand me aright.\\nNot that we look upon him as anything but a man of rectitude and good\\nsense.\"\\n\\n\"Surely you do not mean to imply that he is likely to devour my portion\\nof the food, do you?\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch burst out laughing.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"I feel easy, then,\" continued Bazarov. \"In fact, never do I mind with\\nwhom I sit at table.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch\\'s face brightened at once.\\n\\n\"I felt sure of that in advance,\" he said. \"Yes, I knew that you, a\\nyoung man, are as superior to prejudice as I am at sixty-two\" (Vasili\\nhad none the less shrunk from confessing that he had wished for the\\nthanksgiving ceremony as much as his wife had, since his piety was\\nfully equal to hers). \"In any case Father Alexis would like to make\\nyour acquaintance; while you, for your part, will very likely take to\\nhim, seeing that he not only plays cards, but also (though this is\\nquite between ourselves) smokes a pipe!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? After dinner, then, we will have a game, and I will despoil\\nhim utterly.\"\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha! We shall see, we shall see.\"\\n\\n\"Then at times you hark back to old days?\" Bazarov asked with a tinge\\nof surprise.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch\\'s bronzed cheeks took on a faint flush.\\n\\n\"For shame, Evgenii!\" he muttered. \"Remember that the past is the past.\\nNevertheless, even in this gentleman\\'s presence I am ready to confess\\nthat in my youth I had my addictions, and that, since, I have paid for\\nthem. But how hot the weather is! Let me seat myself beside you; though\\nI hope that, in doing so, I shall not interrupt your conversation?\"\\n\\n\"By no means,\" replied Arkady with alacrity.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch subsided with a grunt and the remark:\\n\\n\"Your _logement_ reminds me of my military bivouacking days--this rick\\nbeing a dressing-station.\" There followed a sigh. \"Aye, many and many\\nan experience have I had in my time. For instance, let me tell you a\\ncurious story about the black death in Bessarabia.\"\\n\\n\"When you received the order of St. Vladimir?\" said Bazarov. \"Yes, I\\nknow the story. But why do you never wear the badge of the order?\"\\n\\n\"As I have told you, I care not a jot for appearances,\" protested\\nVasili Ivanitch (though only on the previous day had he had the red\\nriband of the order removed from his coat). He then embarked upon the\\nstory.\\n\\n\"Evgenii has gone to sleep,\" presently he whispered to Arkady with a\\ngood-humoured wink and a pointing finger. \"Come, come, Evgenii!\" he\\nadded in a louder tone. \"It is time to get up! Time for dinner!\"\\n\\nFather Alexis--a stout, good-looking man with thick, well-combed hair\\nand an embroidered girdle over a lilac cassock--proved a clever,\\nresourceful guest who, taking the initiative as regards shaking hands\\nwith Arkady and Bazarov (somehow he seemed to divine that they did not\\nrequire his blessing), bore himself, in general, with complete absence\\nof restraint, and, while neither demeaning himself nor imposing general\\nconstraint, made merry over scholastic Latin, defended his archbishop,\\nquaffed a couple of glasses of wine (refusing a third), and accepted\\none of Arkady\\'s cigars, though, instead of smoking it, he put it into\\nhis pocket to take home with him. The only thing that was at all\\nunpleasant was the fact that every now and then, on raising a stealthy\\nhand to brush from his face a fly, he, in lieu of doing so, crushed the\\ninsect flat!\\n\\nDinner over, he seated himself with modest zest at the card-table, and\\nended by despoiling Bazarov of two-and-a-half roubles in paper money\\n(this rural establishment took no account of the system of computing\\ncash in silver). During the game the hostess sat beside her son with\\nher cheek resting on her hand as usual, and only rose from the table\\nwhen it became necessary to order further relays of refreshment. Yet\\nto caress Bazarov was more than she dared do; nor did he give her the\\nleast encouragement in that direction; in addition to which Vasili\\nIvanitch further restrained her ardour by whispering at intervals:\\n\"Do not worry our Evgenii. Young men do not like that sort of thing.\"\\nAlso, hardly need it be said that the dinner of which the company\\nhad just partaken had been of the usual sumptuousness, seeing that at\\nbreak of day Timotheitch had set out for Circassian beef, and that\\nthe _starosta_ also had galloped in quest of trout, eels, and crabs,\\nwhile a sum of forty-two kopecks had been paid to peasant women for\\nmushrooms. Arina Vlasievna\\'s eyes, fixed immovably upon Bazarov, had in\\nthem something more than tenderness and affection. In them there were\\nalso sadness, curiosity, a touch of apprehension, and a kind of painful\\ndeference. Yet never did he mark their expression, since never did he\\nturn in her direction, save to put to her the curtest of questions,\\nand, once, to ask her to lay her hand in his, \"for luck.\" On the latter\\noccasion she slipped her plump fingers into his hard, capacious palm,\\nwaited a little, and then asked him:\\n\\n\"Has that helped you at all in your play?\"\\n\\n\"It has not,\" he replied with a contemptuous grimace. \"On the contrary,\\nthings are even worse than they were before.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the cards seem to be against you,\" remarked Father Alexis with an\\nassumed air of sympathy as he stroked his handsome beard.\\n\\n\"But beware of the Code Napoleon, my father,\" observed Vasili Ivanitch\\nas he played an ace. \"Beware of the Code Napoleon.\"\\n\\n\"Which, in the end, brought Napoleon to St. Helena,\" retorted the\\nfather as he trumped the ace.\\n\\n\"A glass of currant wine, Eniushka dear?\" asked Arina Vlasievna.\\n\\nBazarov replied with a shrug of his shoulders.\\n\\nNext day he said to Arkady:\\n\\n\"To-morrow I must depart. The place wearies me, for I wish to work, and\\nit is impossible to do so here. I will come to your place, I think,\\nfor all my chemical preparations are there. Moreover, one can at least\\nlock one\\'s door at your place; whereas here, though my father keeps\\nsaying, \\'My study is entirely at your disposal, and no one shall\\ndisturb you,\\' he himself is never absent for a moment. And, for that\\nmatter, I should be ashamed to lock him outside, or my mother either.\\nSometimes I can hear her groaning in the next room. Yet no sooner do I\\ngo out to her than I find that I have not a word to say.\"\\n\\n\"She will be much distressed at your departure,\" said Arkady. \"And so\\nwill he.\"\\n\\n\"But I intend to return.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly when?\"\\n\\n\"When I am on my way back to St. Petersburg.\"\\n\\n\"I am particularly sorry for your mother.\"\\n\\n\"Why so? Has she been stuffing you with fruit?\" Arkady lowered his eyes.\\n\\n\"You do not know her,\" he said. \"She is not only a good woman, but also\\na very wise one. This morning I had half an hour\\'s very practical and\\ninteresting talk with her.\"\\n\\n\"A talk in which she told you all about me?\"\\n\\n\"We spoke of other topics besides yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Possibly. Possibly, too, you, as an outsider, may see things clearer\\nthan I do. Yet when a woman can talk for half an hour it is a good\\nsign, and I will depart as I have said.\"\\n\\n\"But you will not find it easy to break the news to her, for her plans\\nfor us extend over a couple of weeks.\"\\n\\n\"No, it may not prove easy, as you say; and the less so since the devil\\nled me to vex my father this morning. It was like this. A few days ago\\nhe had one of his serfs flogged, and therein did rightly. No, you need\\nnot look at me with such indignation. I say my father did rightly for\\nthe reason that the peasant in question had proved himself to be an\\narrant thief and drunkard. Unfortunately, my father had not expected\\nme to get to hear of the occurrence; wherefore he was the more put\\nout when he found that I had done so. Well, now his vexation will be\\ntwofold! However, no matter. He will get over it before long.\"\\n\\nYet, though Bazarov had said \"No matter,\" he let the whole of the rest\\nof the day elapse before he could make up his mind to acquaint Vasili\\nIvanitch with his intention. Finally, just as he was saying good-night\\nto his father in the study, he observed with a prolonged yawn:\\n\\n\"By the way, I had almost forgotten to request you to have our horses\\nsent forward to Thedot\\'s.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch looked thunderstruck.\\n\\n\"Then is Monsieur Kirsanov leaving us?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I am going with him.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch fidgeted for a moment or two.\\n\\n\"You say that you are going with him?\" he murmured.\\n\\n\"Yes. I _must_ go. So pray have the horses sent forward as requested.\"\\n\\n\"I--I will, I will,\" the old man stuttered. \"So they are to go to\\nThedot\\'s? Yes, yes, very well. Only, only--is there any particular\\nreason for this change of plan?\"\\n\\n\"There is. I am engaged to pay Arkady a short visit. That done, I will\\nreturn to you.\"\\n\\n\"Only to be a _short_ visit? Good!\" And Vasili Ivanitch pulled out his\\npocket-handkerchief, and blew his nose. In doing so, he bent his head\\nvery low--almost to the ground. \"Well, well! Things shall be as you\\ndesire. Yet we had hoped that you would have stayed with us a little\\nlonger. Three days only! Three days after three years of absence! Ah,\\nthat is not much, Evgenii--it is not much!\"\\n\\n\"But I tell you I intend to return soon. You see, I _must_ go.\"\\n\\n\"You have no choice, eh? Very well, very well. Of course, engagements\\nmust be kept. Yes, yes; of course they must be kept. And I am to\\nsend the horses forward? Very good. Naturally, Arina and I had not\\naltogether looked for this. Only to-day she has been to a neighbour to\\nbeg flowers for your room.\"\\n\\nNor of the fact that, each morning, he had gone downstairs in his\\nslippers to confer with Timotheitch; nor of the fact that, producing,\\nwith tremulous fingers, one ragged banknote after another, he had\\ncommissioned his henchman to make various purchases with special\\nreference to the question of eatables (in particular, of a certain red\\nwine which he had noticed the young men to like); no, of none of these\\nfacts did Vasili Ivanitch make any mention.\\n\\n\"The greatest thing in the world is one\\'s freedom,\" he went on. \"I,\\ntoo, make it my rule. Never should one let oneself be hampered or----\"\\n\\nA sudden break occurred in his voice, and he made for the door.\\n\\n\"I promise you that we will return soon, my father. I give you my word\\nof honour upon that.\"\\n\\nBut Vasili Ivanitch did not look round--he just waved his hand and\\ndeparted. Mounting to the bedroom, he found Arina asleep, so started to\\nsay his prayers in an undertone, for fear of awaking her. But at once\\nshe opened her eyes.\\n\\n\"In that you, Vasili Ivanitch?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, mother.\"\\n\\n\"Have you just left Eniusha? Do you know, I am anxious about him. Does\\nhe sleep comfortably on the sofa? To-day I told Anfisushka to lay him\\nout your travelling mattress and the new pillows. Also, I would have\\ngiven him our feather bed had he not disliked soft lying.\"\\n\\n\"Do not fret, mother dear. He is quite comfortable. \\'Lord, pardon us\\nsinners!\\'\" And Vasili Ivanitch went on with his prayers. Yet his heart\\nwas full of an aching compassion for his old companion; nor did he\\nwant to tell her overnight of the sorrow which was awaiting her on the\\nmorrow.\\n\\nNext day, therefore, Arkady and Bazarov departed. From earliest morn an\\nair of woe pervaded the household. Anfisushka let fall some crockery,\\nand Thedika\\'s perturbation ended in his taking off his shoes. As for\\nVasili Ivanitch, he fussed about, and made a brave show--he talked in\\nloud tones, and stamped his feet upon the floor as he walked; but his\\nface had suddenly fallen in, and his glance could not meet that of\\nhis son. Meanwhile Arina Vlasievna indulged in quiet weeping. Indeed,\\nbut for the fact that her husband had spent two hours that morning in\\ncomforting her, she would have broken down completely, and lost all\\nself-control.\\n\\nBut at last, when, after reiterated promises to return within, at most,\\na month, Bazarov had freed himself from the arms which sought to detain\\nhim, and entered the _tarantass_; when the horses had started, and\\ntheir collar-bow had begun to tinkle, and the wheels to revolve; when\\nto gaze after the vehicle any longer had become useless, and the dust\\nhad subsided, and Timotheitch, bent and tottering, had crawled back\\ninto his pantry; when the old couple found themselves alone in a house\\nwhich seemed suddenly to have grown as dishevelled and as decrepit as\\nthey--then, ah, then did Vasili Ivanitch desist from his brief show of\\nwaving his handkerchief in the verandah, and sink into a chair, and\\ndrop his head upon his breast.\\n\\n\"He has gone for ever, he has gone for ever,\" he muttered. \"He has gone\\nbecause he found the life here tedious, and once more I am as lonely as\\nthe sand of the desert!\"\\n\\nThese words he kept repeating again and again; and, each time that he\\ndid so, he raised his hand, and pointed into the distance.\\n\\nBut presently Arina Vlasievna approached him, and, pressing her grey\\nhead to his, said:\\n\\n\"Never mind, my Vasia. True, our son has broken away from us; he is\\nlike a falcon--he has flown hither, he has flown thither, as he willed:\\nbut you and I, like lichen in a hollow tree, are still side by side, we\\nare not parted.... And ever I shall be the same to you, as you will be\\nthe same to me.\"\\n\\nTaking his hands from his face, Vasili Ivanitch embraced his old\\ncomrade, his wife, as never--no, not even during the days of his\\ncourtship--he had done before. And thus she comforted him.\\n\\n\\n[1] Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov (1729-1800), the great Russian\\ngeneral who, after defeating Napoleon in Italy, crossed the Alps to\\njoin hands with Korsakov, but found the latter to have been routed by\\nMassena.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII\\n\\n\\n\\nIn silence, or merely exchanging a few unimportant words, the\\ntravellers made their way to Thedot\\'s posting-house. Arkady felt\\nanything but pleased with Bazarov, and Bazarov felt anything but\\npleased with himself. Moreover, the younger man\\'s heart was heavy with\\nthe sort of unreasoning depression which is known only to youth.\\n\\nThe driver hitched his horses, and then, mounting to the box, inquired\\nwhether he was to drive to the right or to the left.\\n\\nArkady started. The road to the right led to the town, and thence to\\nhis father\\'s house; while the road to the left led to Madame Odintsov\\'s\\nestablishment.\\n\\nHe glanced at Bazarov.\\n\\n\"To the left, Evgenii?\" he queried.\\n\\nBazarov turned away his head.\\n\\n\"Why that folly again?\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"Folly, I know,\" said Arkady, \"but what does that matter? We need but\\ncall in passing.\"\\n\\nBazarov pulled his cap over his eyes.\\n\\n\"Do as you like,\" he said.\\n\\n\"To the left, then,\" cried Arkady to the coachman; and the _tarantass_\\nstarted in the direction of Nikolsköe. Nevertheless, for all that the\\nfriends had decided upon this foolish course, they remained as silent\\nand downcast as ever.\\n\\nIndeed, Madame Odintsov\\'s butler had not even made his appearance\\nupon the verandah before the pair divined that they had done unwisely\\nto yield to such an impulse. The fact that no one in the house had\\nexpected them was emphasised by the circumstance that when Madame\\nentered the drawing-room they had already spent a considerable time\\nthere in awkward silence. However, she accorded them her usual suave\\nwelcome, though she seemed a little surprised at their speedy return,\\nand, at heart, not over-pleased at it. For this reason they hastened\\nto explain that theirs was a mere passing call, and that in about four\\nhours they would be continuing their journey to the town. In reply she\\nsaid nothing beyond that she requested Arkady to convey her greetings\\nto his father, and then sent for her aunt; and inasmuch as the Princess\\nentered in a state of having just overslept herself, her wrinkled old\\nface betokened even greater malignity than usual. Katia was not well,\\nand did not leave her room at all: and this caused Arkady suddenly to\\nrealise that he would have been as glad to see her as Anna Sergievna.\\nThe four hours were filled with a desultory conversation which Anna\\nSergievna carried on without a single smile: nor until the very moment\\nof parting did her usual friendliness seem to stir within her soul.\\n\\n\"I am out of humour to-day,\" she said, \"but that you must not mind.\\nCome again soon. I address the invitation to you both.\"\\n\\nBazarov and Arkady responded with silent bows, re-entered the\\n_tarantass_, and drove forward to Marino, whither they arrived, without\\nincident, on the following evening. _En route_, neither of the pair\\nmentioned Madame Odintsov, and Barazov in particular scarcely opened\\nhis mouth, but gazed towards the horizon with a hard look in his eyes.\\n\\nBut at Marino every one was delighted to see them, for Nikolai\\nPetrovitch had begun to feel uneasy at the prolonged absence of his\\nson, and now leapt from the sofa with a cry of joy when Thenichka ran\\nto announce that \"the young gentlemen\" were arriving. Yes, even Paul\\nPetrovitch felt conscious of a touch of pleasant excitement, and smiled\\nindulgently as he shook hands with the wanderers. Ensued then much\\ntalking and questioning, in which Arkady took the leading part, and\\nmore especially during supper, which lasted far into the night, since\\nNikolai Petrovitch ordered up several bottles of porter which had\\njust arrived from Moscow, and made so merry that his cheeks assumed a\\nraspberry tint, and he fell to venting half-boyish, half-hysterical\\nlaughs. Moreover, the general enlivenment extended even to the kitchen,\\nwhere Duniasha kept breathlessly banging doors, and at three o\\'clock\\nin the morning Peter essayed to execute on the guitar a Cossack waltz\\nwhich would have sounded sweet and plaintive amid the stillness of the\\nnight had not the performance broken down after the opening cadenza,\\nowing to the fact that nature had denied the cultured underling a\\ntalent either for music or for anything else.\\n\\nIndeed, of late, life at Marino had been far from comfortable. In\\nparticular had poor Nikolai Petrovitch been in a bad way, for his\\ntroubles in connection with the estate--troubles of an exclusively\\nfutile and hopeless order--were growing greater from day to day. The\\nworst of them came of the system of hired labour, which enabled some\\nof the workmen to keep demanding either their discharge or an increase\\nof wages, and others to depart as soon as ever they had received their\\nearnest-money. Also, some of the horses had fallen sick, certain\\nimplements had been burnt, all hands were performing their tasks in a\\nslovenly manner, a milling machine ordered from Moscow had turned out\\nto be useless owing to its weight, a second such machine had broken\\ndown on its first being used, half the cattle sheds had disappeared\\nin a conflagration caused by a blind old serf woman \"smoking\" her cow\\nwith a firestick during blustery weather (though she herself asserted\\nthat the trouble had come of the _barin\\'s_ manufacturing new-fangled\\ncheeses and lacteal products in general), and, lastly, the steward\\nhad grown so fat and lazy (as do all Russians who fall upon \"easy\\ntimes\"), and permitted his dislike of Nikolai Petrovitch so to limit\\nhis activities, that he had come to doing no more than bestowing an\\noccasional prod upon a passing pig, or threatening some half-naked\\nserf boy, while spending the rest of the time in bed. Again, such of\\nthe peasants as had received allotments under the _obrok_ system had\\nfailed to pay their dues, as well as applied themselves to stealing\\ntimber to such an extent that, almost every night, the watchman had to\\napprehend a culprit or two, as well as to impound horses which peasants\\nhad turned out to graze in the meadows attached to the manor. For\\nillicit grazing of this sort Nikolai Petrovitch had decreed forfeiture\\nof the horses; but usually the matter ended in the animals being kept\\nfor a day or two at the _barin\\'s_ expense, and then restored to their\\nowners. Lastly, the peasants had taken to quarrelling among themselves,\\nthrough brothers conceiving the idea of demanding a share of each\\nother\\'s earnings, and through their wives suddenly finding themselves\\nunable to get on in the same hut; wherefore feuds had arisen which\\nhad caused whole households to spring to their feet as at a word of\\ncommand, and to flock to the portico of the estate office, where,\\nbreaking in upon the _barin\\'s_ privacy (very often with bruised faces\\nand drunken gait), they demanded justice and an immediate settlement,\\nwhile female sobs and whimperings mingled with the curses of the male\\nportion of the throng. Whenever this had happened Nikolai Petrovitch\\nhad had to part the hostile factions from one another, and to shout\\nhimself hoarse, even though he had known in advance that no equitable\\ndecision was feasible. Finally, there had been a deficiency of hands\\nfor the harvest, since a neighbouring _odnovorzty_[1] of benign aspect\\nwho had undertaken taken to provide harvesters at two roubles per\\n_desiatin_ had cheated without compunction, and supplied women workers\\nwho also demanded extortionate wages. Meanwhile the grain had rotted\\nin the fields, and, later on, the women had not got through the mowing\\nbefore the Board of Overseers had begun to press for immediate payment\\nof percentage dues and arrears.\\n\\n\"I can do nothing,\" would be Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s despairing\\nexclamation \"My principles forbid me either to contend with these\\npeople or to send for the _stanovoi_[2] yet, without the power to\\nthreaten punishment, one can make no headway with such folk.\"\\n\\n\"_Du calme, du calme_,\" Paul Petrovitch would advise. Then he would\\ngrowl, frown, and twist his moustache.\\n\\nFrom these brawls Bazarov kept entirely aloof: nor, as a guest, was\\nhe called upon to interfere in them, but was free, from the day of\\nhis arrival, to apply himself solely to his frogs, infusoria, and\\nchemical compositions. On the other hand, Arkady considered himself\\nbound, if not to help his father, at all events to offer to help him;\\nwherefore he listened to Nikolai\\'s complaints with patience, and on\\none occasion even tendered him advice (though not advice meant to\\nbe taken, but advice designed to manifest the interest felt by him,\\nArkady, in current affairs). As a matter of fact, estate-management\\nwas not wholly distasteful to him, and he could find pleasure in\\nthinking out agricultural problems; but his mind was filled with other\\npreoccupations. For one thing, he discovered to his surprise that his\\nthoughts were constantly turning in the direction of Nikolsköe; and\\nthough there had been a time when he would have shrugged his shoulders\\nupon being told that he would ever come to find residence under the\\nsame roof as Bazarov--least of all, when that roof was his father\\'s--a\\ndull affair, he found time hang heavy on his hands, and his attention\\neasily stray elsewhere. So he tried the expedient of walking until\\nthoroughly worn out, but even this did not help him; until eventually\\nhe learnt, in conversation with his father, that recently some letters\\nof great interest had been chanced upon--letters which Arkady\\'s mother\\nhad indited to the mother of Madame Odintsov. And from that moment\\nonwards he never rested until he had induced Nikolai Petrovitch to\\nre-discover the said letters, and to turn out, during the search, a\\nscore of boxes and drawers. Then only, when the half-mouldy documents\\nhad been dragged to light, did the young man feel easier in his soul,\\nand bear himself as though now he saw before him the goal of his\\nexistence.\\n\\n\"\\'I address the invitation to both of you,\\'\" he kept whispering to\\nhimself. \"Yes, that is what she said. Damn it, I will go.\"\\n\\nBut next there would recur to his memory the recent visit and its cold\\nreception; until once more he would be seized with his old timidity\\nand awkwardness. In the end, however, the spirit of adventurous youth,\\naided by a secret desire to try his luck, to test his strength unaided,\\nand without a protector, contrived to win the day.\\n\\nTen days later, therefore, he invented a pretext, in the shape of a\\ndesire to study the working of Sunday schools, to drive to the town,\\nand thence to Nikolsköe. As he drove, the manner in which he encouraged\\nhis postilion communicated to his progress the character, rather,\\nof a young officer\\'s trip to fight his first duel, for diffidence,\\nimpatience, and delight were well-nigh choking him.\\n\\n\"Above all things,\" he kept reflecting, \"I must not think too much of\\nmyself.\" And though the postilion who had fallen to his lot was of the\\ntype of rascal who pulls up at every tavern door, there hove in sight,\\nbefore long, the familiar, high-pitched roof of the mansion.\\n\\n\"But what am I doing?\" now occurred to him the thought. \"Indeed, would\\nit not be better to go back?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, to the sound of the postilion\\'s whistlings and\\ntongue-clickings the _troika_ of horses trotted bravely forward, and\\npresently the bridge thundered under the combined weight of the hooves\\nand wheels. Ah, _there_ was the avenue of clipped firs! Yes, and\\n_there_ was a glimpse of a pink dress amid some dark foliage! Yes, and\\n_there_ a glimpse of a young face peering from the shade of a silken\\nparasol! Yes, yes--it _was_ Katia! He had recognised her in an instant,\\nas she him! Bidding the postilion pull up, Arkady leapt from the\\ncarriage, and approached the maiden.\\n\\n\"So it is you?\" she exclaimed. And at the same moment a blush\\noverspread her face. \"Let us go and look for my sister. She is in the\\ngarden, and will be delighted to see you.\"\\n\\nSo she conducted him thither. How lucky that he had met her as he had\\ndone! More pleased he could not have felt if she had been his own\\nsister. Yes, things were indeed fortunate! Now there would have to be\\nno butler, and no formal announcement of his arrival.\\n\\nOf Anna Sergievna he caught sight at a turn in the path. She had\\nher back to him, but presently, on hearing the sound of approaching\\nfootsteps, faced about.\\n\\nOnce more confusion seized Arkady in its grip. Yet no sooner had she\\nspoken than he felt his courage return.\\n\\n\"How do you do?\" she said in her even, kindly way as she advanced to\\nmeet him with a smile that was slightly tempered with the sun and wind.\\n\"Where did you find him, Katia?\"\\n\\n\"I have brought with me something which you are unlikely to have been\\nexpecting,\" he said. \"For I----\"\\n\\n\"But you have brought me yourself,\" she rejoined. \"And that is the best\\nbringing of all.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] A freeholder, a member of the class which, in the days of this\\nstory, stood midway between the _pomiestchik_, or landowner, and the\\n_Krestianin_, or serf.\\n\\n[2] Magistrate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII\\n\\n\\nAfter speeding Arkady on his way with satirical expressions of regret\\n(as well as giving him to understand that the satirist laboured under\\nno delusions as to the object of the young man\\'s journey), Bazarov\\nwithdrew into complete seclusion, since a perfect fever for work had\\ncome upon him. Nor did he quarrel any longer with Paul Petrovitch,\\nand the less so since the latter had now come to adopt an exclusively\\naristocratic attitude, and to express his sentiments only in\\nmonosyllables, not in words. Once, and once only, did he allow himself\\nto engage in a controversy with Bazarov over the then current question\\nof the rights of the _dvoriané_. But suddenly he checked himself, and\\nsaid with an air of cold politeness:\\n\\n\"It is clear that we shall never understand one another. At all events\\n_I_ have not the honour to understand _you_.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" agreed Bazarov. \"For a man may understand the precipitation\\nof ether, and be _au fait_ with what is taking place in the sun, yet,\\nconfront him with the fact that another man blows his nose differently\\nfrom the manner in which he blows his own, and at once that man will\\nbecome lost in perplexity.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, there were occasions when Paul Petrovitch requested\\npermission to attend the other\\'s experiments; and once he went so far\\nas to apply his perfumed, clean-shaven features to the microscope, for\\nthe purpose of observing how a transparent infusorium could swallow a\\ngreenish-looking particle, and then masticate the same with fang-like\\nprotuberances which grew in its throat. Still more frequently was\\nNikolai Petrovitch present in Bazarov\\'s room. Indeed, but for the\\ncounter-distraction of estate-management, he would have spent his whole\\ntime in the process of what he called \"self-improvement.\" Yet he never\\nhampered the young naturalist: on the contrary, he would seat himself\\nin a remote corner of the room, and, but for a guarded question or\\ntwo, confine himself solely to silently and absorbedly watching the\\nexperiments. Also, at meal times he always endeavoured to turn the\\nconversation in the direction of physics or geology or chemistry, for\\nthe reason that he divined in any other direction (that of industry,\\nor, still more, that of politics) there lay a greater danger of\\ncollisions, or, at all events, of mutual soreness. For rightly did\\nhe divine that his brother\\'s enmity towards Bazarov had by no means\\nabated. And to this conclusion an incident which occurred at a juncture\\nwhen cholera had just made its appearance in the neighbourhood, and\\ncarried off two victims from Marino itself, lent additional colour.\\nOne night Paul Petrovitch happened to be seized with a fainting fit,\\nyet refused to apply to Bazarov for assistance; and when Bazarov, on\\nmeeting him on the following day, inquired why such a course had not\\nbeen adopted, Paul Petrovitch--still pale, but as carefully brushed and\\ncombed as ever--retorted: \"Did not you yourself tell me that you have\\nno belief in medicine?\"\\n\\nThus day followed day. Yet, though Bazarov devoted himself wholly to\\nwork, there was one person in the house whom he did not hold at arm\\'s\\nlength, but was always willing to talk to. That person was Thenichka.\\nMostly he encountered her in the early mornings, when she was walking\\nin the garden or the courtyard; but never did he enter her room, nor\\ndid she ever come to his door, save once, for the purpose of asking\\nhim to help her with Mitia\\'s bath. And she not only trusted Bazarov;\\nshe also held him in no awe, and allowed herself more freedom in\\nhis presence than she did in that of Nikolai Petrovitch himself.\\nThe reason is difficult to determine. Perhaps it was the fact that\\nunconsciously she detected in Bazarov none of the _dvorianin_ element,\\nnone of that superiority which at once attracts and repels; the young\\nNihilist, to her, was just a clever doctor, and no more. At all events,\\nshe was so free from shyness in his presence that she would dandle her\\nchild unabashed, and, on one occasion, when seized with a headache,\\nwent so far as to accept at his hands a spoonful of medicine. True,\\nin Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s presence she seemed to shun Bazarov; but this\\nwas done more out of a sense of decorum than through subtlety. As for\\nPaul Petrovitch, she feared him as much as ever, for he had taken to\\nwatching her with a keen, steady eye, and to making his appearance\\nbehind her as though his figure, clad in its inevitable English\\nsuit, and posed in its usual attitude of hands in trousers pockets,\\nhad suddenly sprung from the floor. \"Whenever I see him I feel cold\\nall over,\" once she complained to Duniasha; whereupon that maiden\\'s\\nthoughts reverted longingly to another \"unfeeling\" individual who had,\\nall unwittingly, come to be \"the cruel tyrant\" of her heart.\\n\\nThenichka, therefore, liked Bazarov, and Bazarov liked Thenichka.\\nIndeed, no sooner did he speak to her than his face would undergo a\\nchange, and, assuming a bright, almost a good-humoured, expression,\\nexchange its habitual superciliousness for something like playful\\nsolicitude. Meanwhile she grew more beautiful daily. In the lives of\\nyoung women there is a season when they begin to unfold and bloom\\nlike the roses in summer: and to that period Thenichka had just come.\\nEverything, even the July heat then prevalent, contributed to it.\\nDressed in a gown of some light white material, she looked even lighter\\nand whiter than it; and though she escaped actual sunburn, the heated\\nair imparted to her cheeks and ears a faint tan, and, permeating her\\nframe with gentle indolence, imbued her exquisite eyes with dreamy\\nlanguor. No longer could she do any work; she could only let her hands\\nsink upon her lap, and there remain. Seldom going even for a stroll,\\nshe spent the most of her time in a state of gently querulous and\\npanting, but not distasteful, inertia.\\n\\n\"You should go and bathe as often as you can,\" Nikolai Petrovitch said\\nto her one day (he had had a large, canopied bathing-place constructed\\nin one of the last few ponds on the estate).\\n\\n\"Ah!\" she gasped. \"Even to walk to the pond half-kills me: and to walk\\nback from it half-kills me again. There is no shade in the garden, you\\nsee.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" he agreed, wiping his forehead.\\n\\nAt seven o\\'clock one morning, when Bazarov was returning from a walk,\\nhe encountered Thenichka in the midst of a lilac clump which, though\\npast the season of flowering, was still green and leafy. As usual, she\\nhad a white scarf thrown over her head, and beside the bench on which\\nshe was sitting there was a bunch of red and white roses with the dew\\nyet glistening on their petals. He bade her good morning.\\n\\n\"It is you, then, Evgenii Vasilitch!\" she exclaimed as she put aside a\\ncorner of her scarf to look at him--a movement which bared her arm to\\nthe elbow.\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked as he seated himself beside her. \"Is it\\na nosegay you are making?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, for the breakfast table. Nikolai Petrovitch is so fond of such\\nthings.\"\\n\\n\"But breakfast is not yet. What a waste of flowers!\"\\n\\n\"I know, but I gather them now because later the weather becomes too\\nhot for walking. This is the only time when it is possible even to\\nbreathe. The heat makes me faint, and I am afraid of falling ill with\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Mere fancy. Let me feel your pulse.\"\\n\\nHe took her hand in his, and found the pulse to be beating with such\\nregularity that he did not trouble even to count its throbs.\\n\\n\"You will live to be a hundred,\" he said as he relinquished her wrist.\\n\\n\"God preserve me from that!\" exclaimed she.\\n\\n\"Why so? Surely you would like to live a long time?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I should; but not for a hundred years. You see, my grandmother\\nlived to be eighty-five, but suffered terribly. Long before she died\\nshe had a constant cough, and was also blind and deaf and crooked, and\\nhad become a burden to herself. What would be the use of a life like\\nthat?\"\\n\\n\"You think that it is better to be young?\"\\n\\n\"I do. And why not?\"\\n\\n\"How is it better? Tell me that.\"\\n\\n\"How is it better? Oh, as long as one is young one can do what one\\nwants to do--one can walk about, and carry things, and not be dependent\\nupon other folk. Is not that the best way?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. At all events _I_ care not whether I be young or old.\"\\n\\n\"What makes you say that? Surely you cannot mean it?\"\\n\\n\"No? Well, think of what my youth means to me. I am a lonely man, a man\\nwithout home or--\"\\n\\n\"But all depends upon yourself.\"\\n\\n\"No, it does not. I only wish that some one would take pity upon my\\nloneliness!\"\\n\\nShe glanced at him, but said nothing. After a pause she resumed:\\n\\n\"What is that book of yours?\"\\n\\n\"This? It is a learned, scholarly work.\"\\n\\n\"How you study! Do you never grow tired of it? By this time, I should\\nthink, you must know everything.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do not.... But try reading a few lines of the book.\"\\n\\n\"I should never understand them. Is it a Russian book?\" (She took the\\nheavily bound volume into her hands.)\\n\\n\"What a large book!\" she continued.\\n\\n\"Yes. Also, it is a Russian book.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless I should not be able to understand it.\\n\\n\"I do not want you to understand it. I merely want to be able to watch\\nyou as you read. For when you read you twitch your little nose most\\ncharmingly!\"\\n\\nShe began to read aloud a page \"on Creosote,\" but soon burst out\\nlaughing, and replaced the book upon the bench, whence it slipped to\\nthe ground.\\n\\n\"I love to see you laugh,\" said Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Say no more,\" she interrupted.\\n\\n\"Also, I love to hear you speak. Your voice is like the bubbling of a\\nbrook.\"\\n\\nShe turned away her head, and fell to sorting her flowers. Presently\\nshe resumed:\\n\\n\"Why do you love to hear me speak? You must have talked to many much\\nfiner and cleverer ladies?\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, nevertheless, that all the I fine and clever ladies\\' in\\nthe world are worth less than your little finger.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come!\" And she crossed her hands.\\n\\nBazarov picked up the book.\\n\\n\"It is a work on medicine,\" he observed. \"Why did you throw it away?\"\\n\\n\"It is a work on medicine?\" she re-echoed, and turned to him again. \"Do\\nyou know, ever since you gave me those capsules--you remember them, do\\nyou not?--Mitia has slept splendidly! I can never sufficiently thank\\nyou. You are indeed good!\"\\n\\n\"But the physician ought to be paid his fee,\" remarked he with a\\nsmile. \"Doctors never do their work for nothing.\"\\n\\nUpon this she raised her eyes. They looked all the darker for the\\nbrilliant glare which was beating upon the upper portion of her face.\\nAs a matter of fact, she was trying to divine whether he was speaking\\nin earnest or in jest.\\n\\n\"Of course I should be delighted to pay you!\" she said. \"But first I\\nmust mention the matter to Nikolai Petrovitch.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" he exclaimed. \"You really think it is _money_ I want? No, I do\\nnot require of you money.\"\\n\\n\"What, then?\" she queried.\\n\\n\"What? Well, guess.\"\\n\\n\"How can I guess?\"\\n\\n\"Then I must tell you. I want, I want--I want one of those roses.\"\\n\\nShe burst into a peal of laughter, and clapped her hands with delight\\nat the request. Yet the laughter was accompanied with a certain sense\\nof relief. Bazarov eyed her.\\n\\n\"Ah, you must excuse my laughing, Evgenii Vasilitch,\" she said (bending\\nover the seat of the bench, she fumbled among the roses). \"Which sort\\nshould you prefer? A red rose or a white one?\"\\n\\n\"A red one, and not too large.\"\\n\\n\"Then take this one,\" she said, sitting up again. Yet even as she spoke\\nshe drew back her outstretched hand, and, biting her lips, glanced in\\nthe direction of the entrance to the arbour, and listened intently.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked Bazarov. \"Do you hear Nikolai Petrovitch coming?\"\\n\\n\"No. Besides, every one has gone out to the fields. Nor do I fear any\\none except Paul Petrovitch. I merely thought that, that----\"\\n\\n\"You thought what?\"\\n\\n\"That some one _might_ be coming this way. It seems I was wrong. Take\\nthis rose.\"\\n\\nShe handed Bazarov the gift.\\n\\n\"_Why_ do you fear Paul Petrovitch?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"I do so because he frightens me--when I speak to him he returns me no\\nanswer; he just stares at me in a meaning sort of way. You, too, do not\\nlike him, I believe? It was with him that you had such a quarrel, was\\nit not? What it was all about I do not know, but at least I know that\\nyou worsted him like, like With a gesture she signified the manner in\\nwhich she considered Bazarov to have routed Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"And, had _he_ worsted _me_,\" he inquired, \"would you have taken my\\npart?\"\\n\\n\"How could I? We should have agreed no better than you and he.\"\\n\\n\"You think so? Then let me tell you that a certain little hand could\\ntwist me around its little finger.\"\\n\\n\"Whose hand is that?\"\\n\\n\"I expect you can guess. But smell this rose which you have just given\\nme.\"\\n\\nShe bent forward in the direction of the flower, and as she did so her\\nscarf slipped from her head to her shoulders, and revealed a mass of\\ndark, soft, fluffy, glossy hair.\\n\\n\"Wait,\" said Bazarov. \"I, too, will smell the rose.\" And, reaching\\nforward, he kissed her full on her parted lips.\\n\\nShe started back, and pressed her hands against his breast as though\\nto repel him; but so weak was the act of repulsion that he found it\\npossible to renew and to prolong his kiss.\\n\\nSuddenly there sounded from among the lilac bushes a dry cough, and\\njust as Thenichka darted to the other end of the bench Paul Petrovitch\\nappeared, bowed slightly to the pair, said with a sort of melancholy\\nacidity in his tone: \"It is you, then?\" and turned on his heel and\\ndeparted. The next moment Thenichka picked up her roses and rushed from\\nthe arbour. As she passed Bazarov she whispered in his ear: \"That was\\nindeed wrong of you, Evgenii Vasilitch!\" And the words voiced a note of\\nreproach that was palpably genuine and unfeigned.\\n\\nInstantly Bazarov\\'s thoughts recurred to another scene in which he\\nhad recently taken part, and he became conscience-stricken, as also\\ncontemptuous of himself, and vexed. He shook his head, congratulated\\nhimself ironically on his folly, and departed to his room.\\n\\nAs for Paul Petrovitch, he left the garden and walked slowly into the\\nforest. He remained there a considerable time; and, on returning to\\nbreakfast, looked so dark of mien that Nikolai Petrovitch inquired\\nanxiously whether he were not ill.\\n\\n\"As you know,\" replied the other quietly, \"I suffer habitually from\\nbiliousness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV\\n\\n\\nTwo hours later he knocked at Bazarov\\'s door.\\n\\n\"I feel that I must apologise for disturbing you in your pursuits,\" he\\nsaid as he seated himself near the window and rested both hands upon\\na fine ivory-headed cane which he had brought with him (as a rule he\\ndid not carry one). \"But the fact is that circumstances compel me to\\nrequest five minutes of your time.\"\\n\\n\"The _whole_ of my time is at your disposal,\" replied Bazarov, across\\nwhose features, as Paul Petrovitch had crossed the threshold, there had\\nflitted a curious expression.\\n\\n\"No; five minutes will be sufficient. I have come to ask you a simple\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"And what might that question be?\"\\n\\n\"Listen. When first you came to stay in my brother\\'s house, and I had\\nnot yet been forced to deny myself the pleasure of conversing with you,\\nit fell to my lot to hear you hold forth on many different subjects.\\nBut, unless my memory deceives me, never once did the conversation\\nbetween you and myself, or in my presence, happen to fall upon the\\nsubject of the duel or single combat. Would you, therefore, mind\\nputting yourself out to the extent of giving me the benefit of your\\nviews on the subject mentioned?\"\\n\\nBazarov, who had risen to receive his visitor, now reseated himself\\nupon the edge of the table, and folded his arms upon his breast.\\n\\n\"My views are as follows,\" he replied. \"From the theoretical\\nstandpoint, the duel is a sheer absurdity. From the practical\\nstandpoint, it is another matter altogether.\"\\n\\n\"You intend to convey (if I have understood you aright?) that,\\napart from your theoretical views on the duel, you would not, in\\npractice, allow yourself to be insulted without subsequently demanding\\nsatisfaction?\"\\n\\n\"You have guessed my meaning precisely.\"\\n\\n\"Good! It is a view which I am indeed glad to hear you express, in that\\nit delivers me from a dilemma.\"\\n\\n\"You mean, from a state of indecision?\"\\n\\n\"They are one and the same thing. I express myself in this manner to\\nthe end that you may understand me. I am not one of your college rats.\\nConsequently I repeat that through your words I am relieved of the\\nnecessity of resorting to what would have been a painful expedient. To\\nspeak plainly, I have made up my mind to fight you.\"\\n\\nBazarov raised his eyebrows a little.\\n\\n\"To fight me?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes, to fight you.\"\\n\\n\"And for what reason--if you do not mind telling me?\"\\n\\n\"For a reason which I might explain, but concerning which I prefer to\\nremain silent. Suffice it for me to intimate that your presence offends\\nme, that I detest and despise your person, and (should the foregoing be\\ninsufficient) that I----\"\\n\\n\"Enough!\" interrupted Bazarov. His eyes had flashed even as Paul\\'s had\\ndone. \"Further explanations would be superfluous. You have presumed to\\nwhet upon me your chivalrous spirit; wherefore, though I might have\\nrefused it, I will afford you satisfaction to the top of your bent.\"\\n\\n\"I have to express to you my sincere obligation. From the first did\\nI feel encouraged to hope that you would accept my challenge without\\nconstraining me to resort to more forcible measures.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, and speaking without metaphor, to that cane?\" said\\nBazarov in a tone of supreme indifference.\\n\\n\"Well, that is fair enough. Further insults are not needed--nor would\\nyou have found the offering of them altogether free from danger.\\nPray, therefore, remain a gentleman. It is as one that I accept your\\nchallenge.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" replied Paul Petrovitch; and he laid aside his cane. \"Next, a\\nfew words on the subject of the conditions of our duel. First, pray be\\nso good as to inform me whether or not you deem it necessary to resort\\nto the formality of some such small difference of opinion as might\\nserve as an ostensible excuse for my challenge?\"\\n\\n\"I think that unnecessary. Such things are best done without\\nformalities of any kind.\"\\n\\n\"I agree--that is to say, I, like you, consider that to go into the\\ntrue reasons for our antagonism would be inexpedient. Let us therefore\\nallege to the world that we could not abide one another. What need\\nwould there be to say more?\"\\n\\n\"What indeed?\" echoed Bazarov in a tone decidedly ironical.\\n\\n\"Also, with regard to the actual conditions of the duel. Inasmuch as we\\nhave no seconds--for where could we find them?----\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. Where indeed?\"\\n\\n\"I have the honour to propose to you the following. Let us fight\\nto-morrow morning--say, at six o\\'clock: the rendezvous to be behind the\\ncopse, the weapons to be pistols, and the distance ten paces.\"\\n\\n\"Ten paces. Quite so! You and I abhor each other even at ten paces.\"\\n\\n\"Eight, then, if you wish?\"\\n\\n\"The same applies to eight.\"\\n\\n\"And the number of shots to be two apiece. Also, in case either of us\\nshould fall, let each of us previously place in his pocket a letter\\nlaying upon himself the entire blame for his demise.\"\\n\\n\"To that condition I wholly demur,\" said Bazarov.\\n\\n\"I think that you are straying into the pages of a French novel, and\\naway from reality.\"\\n\\n\"Possibly I am. But, also, you will agree that to incur an unmerited\\nsuspicion of murder is a prospect not pleasant to contemplate?\"\\n\\n\"I do. Yet still there remains another method of avoiding such an\\nawkward imputation. That is to say, though we shall have no seconds, we\\ncan have a witness.\"\\n\\n\"Whom precisely, if I might ask?\"\\n\\n\"Peter.\"\\n\\n\"Peter? What Peter?\"\\n\\n\"Peter the valet, a man who stands at the apex of contemporary culture,\\nand could therefore play the rôle, and perform the functions, proper to\\nsuch an occasion pre-eminently _comme il faut._\"\\n\\n\"I think that you are jesting, my good sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am not. If you will deign to give my proposal consideration you\\nwill speedily arrive at the conviction that it is as simple as it is\\ncharged with good sense. Schiller it would be impossible to hide in a\\nbag, but I will undertake to prepare Peter for the part, and to bring\\nhim to the rendezvous.\"\\n\\n\"Still you are pleased to jest,\" said Paul Petrovitch as he rose. \"But\\nas you have so kindly met me, I have not the right to make further\\nclaims upon your time. All is arranged, then? In passing, have you any\\npistols?\"\\n\\n\"How should I have any pistols? I am not a man of war.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps you will allow me to offer you some of mine? Rest assured\\nthat they have not been fired by me for five years.\"\\n\\n\"A very comforting assurance!\"\\n\\n\"Lastly,\" said Paul Petrovitch as he reached for his cane, \"it only\\nremains for me to thank you, and to leave you to your pursuits. I have\\nthe honour to bid you good-day.\"\\n\\n\"And I to say farewell until our pleasant meeting.\"\\n\\nWith which Bazarov escorted his visitor to the door.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch gone, Bazarov stood awhile in thought. Then he\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"Splendid indeed! Yet also unutterably stupid! What a comedy to play!\\nTalk of educated dogs dancing on their hind legs!... However, I could\\nnot have refused him, for, otherwise, he would have struck me and\\n_then_\"--Bazarov turned pale, for his pride had been aroused--\"well,\\n_then_ I should have strangled him like a kitten!\"\\n\\nHe returned to his microscope, but found his heart to be still\\nbeating, and the coolness necessary to scientific observation to have\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\"I suppose he saw us this morning,\" he continued to himself. \"Yet\\nsurely he is not doing this on his brother\\'s behalf? For what is there\\nin a kiss? No; something else is in the background. Bah! What if it\\nshould be that he himself is in love with her? Yes, that is it. It is\\nas clear as day. What a mess! Truly a horrible mess, however it be\\nviewed! For first of all I am to have my brains blown out, and then I\\nam to be made to leave this place! And there is Arkady to consider, and\\nthat old heifer Nikolai Petrovitch. Awkward! Awkward indeed!\"\\n\\nHowever, the day dragged its slow length along. Thenichka remained\\npractically non-existent (in other words, she kept to her room as\\nclosely as a mouse to its hole), Nikolai Petrovitch walked about with\\na careworn air (it had been reported to him that mildew had begun to\\nattack the wheat), and Paul Petrovitch\\'s mien of icy urbanity succeeded\\nin damping the spirits of Prokofitch himself.\\n\\nPresently Bazarov sat down to write a letter to his father, but tore it\\nup, and threw the pieces under the table.\\n\\n\"Should I be killed,\" he reflected, \"my parents will hear of it soon\\nenough. But I shall _not_ be killed--I have yet far to wander about the\\nworld.\"\\n\\nNext he ordered Peter to call him at dawn; and inasmuch as the order\\nwas accompanied with a mention of important business, Peter jumped\\nto the conclusion that it was Bazarov\\'s intention to take him to St.\\nPetersburg. Bazarov then retired to rest. Yet, late though he had done\\nso, he was troubled with fantastic visions. Ever before him there\\nflitted Madame Odintsov, who was also his mother. And ever behind her\\nthere walked a black cat, which was also Thenichka. For his part, Paul\\nPetrovitch figured as a forest which the dreamer was engaged to fight.\\n\\nAt length, when four o\\'clock arrived, Peter came to rouse him. Hastily\\ndressing himself, he left the house with the valet. The morning was\\nfine and fresh, and though a few wisps of cloud were trailing across\\nthe pale-blue transparency of the zenith, a light dew had coated the\\ngrass and foliage with drops, and was shining like silver on spiders\\'\\nwebs. The steaming earth seemed still to be seeking to detain the\\nroseate traces of dawn in her embrace; but presently every quarter of\\nthe sky became lit up, and resounded again to the songs of larks.\\n\\nBazarov walked straight ahead until he reached the copse--then seated\\nhimself at the shadowy edge of the trees, and explained to Peter the\\nservices which he looked to the latter to perform; upon which the\\n\"cultured\" menial came near to fainting, and was calmed only with\\nan assurance that he would but have to stand at a distance, as a\\nlooker-on, and that in no case would responsibility attach to his\\nperson.\\n\\n\"And think,\" Bazarov concluded, \"in what an important rôle you are\\nabout to figure!\"\\n\\nBut Peter, extending his hands deprecatingly, only turned up his eyes,\\nbecame green in the face, and went and leant against a birch tree.\\n\\nThe copse was skirted by the road from Marino, and the light coating of\\ndust bore no mark of having been disturbed since the previous evening,\\nwhether by wheel or by foot. Involuntarily Bazarov kept glancing along\\nthis road as, plucking and chewing stems of grass, he repeated again\\nand again to himself: \"What a piece of folly!\" More than once, too,\\nthe morning air made him shiver, and Peter gaze plaintively in his\\ndirection; but Bazarov only laughed, for _he_ at least was no coward.\\n\\nAt length hoofs sounded along the road, and there came into sight from\\nbehind the trees a peasant driving two horses with traces attached. As\\nthe man passed Bazarov he looked at him inquisitively, but failed to\\ndoff his cap; and this circumstance impressed Peter unfavourably, since\\nthe valet considered it a bad omen.\\n\\n\"Like ourselves, that peasant has risen early,\" thought Bazarov. \"But\\nwhereas _he_ has risen to work, _we_----!\"\\n\\n\"Some one else is coming, I believe,\" whispered Peter.\\n\\nBazarov raised his head, and saw Paul Petrovitch, in a light check\\njacket and a pair of snow-white trousers, walking briskly along the\\nroad. Under his arm was a green, baize-covered box.\\n\\n\"Pardon me for having kept you waiting,\" he said with a bow to Bazarov,\\nand then one to Peter (for even to the latter he, for the nonce, seemed\\nto accord something of the respect due to a second). \"As a matter of\\nfact, I was loth to arouse my valet.\"\\n\\n\"I beg that you will not mention it,\" replied Bazarov. \"We ourselves\\nhave only just arrived.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better!\" And Paul Petrovitch glanced about him. \"There\\nwill be no one to see us or disturb us. Are you agreeable to\\nproceeding?\"\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"And I presume that you require no further explanations?\"\\n\\n\"None whatsoever.\"\\n\\n\"Then kindly load these.\" Paul Petrovitch took from the box a brace of\\npistols.\\n\\n\"No. Do you load, while I measure the distance--my legs are longer\\nthan yours.\" This last Bazarov added with a dry smile. \"Now, one, two,\\nthree----\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" gasped Peter, who was trembling as with ague.\\n\"I beg your pardon, but might I move further away?\"\\n\\n\"Four, five---- Certainly, my good fellow! Pray do so. You can go and\\nstand behind that tree there, and stop your ears--provided that you\\ndo not also stop your eyes. Lastly, should either Monsieur Kirsanov\\nor myself fall, you are to run and pick up the fallen. Six, seven,\\neight----\" Bazarov halted. \"That will do, I suppose?\" he added to Paul\\nPetrovitch. \"Or would you prefer me to add another couple of paces?\"\\n\\n\"Do as you please,\" the other replied as he rammed home the second of\\nthe two bullets.\\n\\n\"Then I will add those two paces.\" And Bazarov scratched a line in the\\nsoil with his toe. \"Here is the mark. _Apropos_, how many paces is each\\nof us to retire from our respective marks?\"\\n\\n\"Ten, I presume,\" said Paul Petrovitch as he proffered Bazarov a brace\\nof pistols. \"Will you kindly make choice of these?\"\\n\\n\"I will. Nevertheless you will agree that our duel is singular, even to\\nthe point of absurdity? For pray observe the countenance of our second!\"\\n\\n\"It is still your pleasure to jest,\" Paul Petrovitch responded coldly.\\n\"Of the singularity of our contest I make no denial. I merely consider\\nit my duty to warn you that I intend to right you in grim earnest. So,\\n_à bon entendeur, salut!_\"\\n\\n\"Yet, even though we intend to exterminate one another, why should we\\nnot enjoy our jest, and thus combine _utile_ with _dulce_? You have\\nspoken to me in French. I reply in Latin.\"\\n\\n\"I repeat that I intend to fight you in grim earnest,\" said Paul\\nPetrovitch; with which he moved to his place, and Bazarov, after\\ncounting ten paces from his mark, turned, and halted.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" inquired Paul Petrovitch.\\n\\n\"I am.\"\\n\\n\"Then engage.\"\\n\\nBazarov started to advance, and Paul Petrovitch did the same, with\\nhis left hand thrust into his coat pocket, and his right gradually\\nelevating the muzzle of his pistol.\\n\\n\"The fellow is aiming straight for my nose,\" thought Bazarov to\\nhimself. \"And how the rascal is screwing up his eyes as he marches!\\nThis is not a wholly pleasing sensation. I had better keep my eyes\\nfixed upon his watch-chain.\"\\n\\nPast Bazarov\\'s ear something suddenly whistled, while almost at the\\nsame moment there came the sound of a report.\\n\\n\"I seemed to hear something, but no matter,\" was the thought which\\nflashed through Bazarov\\'s brain. Then he advanced another step, and,\\nwithout aiming, pulled the trigger.\\n\\nAs he did so Paul Petrovitch gave a faint start, and clapped his hand\\nto his thigh, down the white trouser-leg of which there began to\\ntrickle a thin stream of blood.\\n\\nBazarov threw aside his pistol and approached his antagonist.\\n\\n\"Are you wounded?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Pray recall me to the mark,\" said Paul Petrovitch. \"You have the right\\nso to do, and we are merely wasting time. The conditions of the contest\\nallow of a second shot apiece.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, that can be deferred,\" said Bazarov, catching hold of Paul\\nPetrovitch, who was beginning to turn pale in the face. \"I am no longer\\na duellist, but a doctor, and must examine your wound. Peter! Here!\\nWhere the devil has the man got to?\"\\n\\n\"This is sheer folly,\" gasped Paul Petrovitch. \"I need no help. Let\\nus----\" Yet, even as he tried to twirl his moustache, his arm fell to\\nhis side, his eyes closed, and he collapsed in a swoon.\\n\\n\"Something new!\" involuntarily cried Bazarov as he laid his antagonist\\nupon the grass. \"A swoon! Let us see what is the matter with him.\"\\n\\nTaking out his pocket-handkerchief, he wiped away the blood, and probed\\nthe neighbourhood of the wound.\\n\\n\"The bone is intact,\" he muttered. \"Yes, and the bullet has merely\\npierced the flesh a little below the surface. Nothing but the _musculus\\nvastus externus_ is so much as touched. In three weeks\\' time we shall\\nhave him trotting about again. A swoon! Oh these men of nerves! What\\nthin skins, to be sure!\"\\n\\n\"Is--is he dead?\" came in Peter\\'s tremulous voice from behind.\\n\\nBazarov looked up.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said. \"Run for a little water, and he will outlive us both.\"\\n\\nUnfortunately the \"perfect servant\" did not understand what was said\\nto him, but remained stock still. In fact, even when, the next moment,\\nPaul Petrovitch opened his eyes Peter went on crossing himself and\\nrepeating: \"He is dying!\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur Bazarov,\" the wounded man said with a twisted smile, \"you\\nwere perfectly in the right when you said that the face of that man was\\nthe face of a fool.\"\\n\\n\"It is so,\" agreed Bazarov. \"Damn you, will you fetch some water!\" (The\\nlatter to the valet.)\\n\\n\"There is no need,\" put in Paul Petrovitch. \"It was only a passing\\nvertigo. Kindly assist me to sit up. That is it. A scratch like this\\nwill require only to be bandaged for me to walk home again. There will\\nbe no necessity to have the _drozhki_ sent. For that matter, the duel\\nneed not be renewed unless you wish it. At least to-day you have acted\\nlike a gentleman. Kindly note that I have said so.\"\\n\\n\"To the past we have no need to refer,\" said Bazarov. \"And, as regards\\nthe future, it calls for equally little remark, seeing that I intend\\nto leave here at once. Allow me to bind your leg. The wound is not\\ndangerous, but one of a nature which will make it as well to have the\\nblood staunched. But first I must restore that stuck pig to life.\"\\n\\nShaking Peter vigorously by the collar, he dispatched him in search of\\nthe _drozhki._\\n\\n\"But see that you do not alarm my brother,\" was Paul Petrovitch\\'s\\ninjunction also to the man. \"You are not to breathe a word of what has\\nhappened.\"\\n\\nPeter set off at full speed. During the time that he was hastening for\\nthe _drozhki_, the two antagonists sat silently side by side on the\\nground, while Paul Petrovitch tried his best not to look at Bazarov,\\nfor the reason that he did not feel inclined to become reconciled with\\nhim, while at the same time he felt ashamed alike of his impulsiveness,\\nhis failure, and the scheme which had had this ending, though he\\nrealised that it might have been worse.\\n\\n\"At least will the fellow swagger here no more,\" he thought to himself\\nby way of consolation. \"And, for that, much thanks!\"\\n\\nThe silence was a heavy, awkward silence, for neither of the pair felt\\ncomfortable--each of them recognised that the other had taken his\\nmeasure. To friends, such a recognition may be very agreeable, but to\\nfoes it is far from welcome--least of all, when neither explanations\\nnor a parting are feasible.\\n\\n\"I hope that I have not bound your leg too tightly?\" said Bazarov at\\nlast.\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" replied Paul Petrovitch. \"As a matter of fact, it is doing\\nsplendidly.\" After a pause he added: \"But we cannot deceive my brother.\\nHow would it be if we were to tell him that we fell out over politics?\"\\n\\n\"Capital!\" agreed Bazarov. \"Tell him, for instance, that I started\\ncursing Anglomaniacs.\"\\n\\n\"A good idea! But what can that man be thinking of us? I cannot\\nimagine.\" The speaker pointed to the same peasant who, shortly before\\nthe duel, had driven a pair of loose horses past Bazarov, and was\\nnow shuffling homewards, while doffing his cap at the sight of the\\ngentlemen.\\n\\n\"Who can say?\" replied Bazarov. \"Probably he is thinking of nothing at\\nall. As Madame Radcliffe[1] frequently reminds us, the Russian _muzhik_\\nis an unknown quantity. Does _any_ one understand him? He does not even\\nunderstand himself.\"\\n\\n\"There you go again!\" began Paul Petrovitch, but suddenly broke off to\\nsay in a still louder tone: \"See what that fool Peter has done! Here\\ncomes my brother himself!\"\\n\\nSure enough, on turning his head, Bazarov saw Nikolai Petrovitch\\'s pale\\nface peering from the _drozhki._ Nor had the vehicle come to a halt\\nbefore Nikolai had sprung from the step, and rushed towards his brother.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" he cried in agitated accents. \"Evgenii Vasilitch, I beg\\nof you to tell me what has happened.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing has happened,\" replied Paul Petrovitch in Bazarov\\'s stead.\\n\"You are disturbing yourself to no purpose. I had a small quarrel with\\nMonsieur Bazarov, and have paid a penalty as small.\"\\n\\n\"But whence did it arise? For God\\'s sake tell me!\"\\n\\n\"What is there to say? It arose from the fact that Monsieur Bazarov\\nspoke in disrespectful terms of Sir Robert Peel. I would hasten to add\\nthat, throughout, I alone was at fault, and that Monsieur Bazarov bore\\nhimself admirably--I being the challenger.\"\\n\\n\"But look at the blood!\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! Did you suppose my veins to run with water? As a matter of\\nfact, the blood-letting will do me good. Is not that so, doctor? Help\\nme to mount the _drozhki_, and away with melancholy! By to-morrow I\\nshall be recovered. Splendid! That is the way to do it. Right away,\\ncoachman!\"\\n\\nWhen on the point of starting homewards in the wake of the _drozhki_,\\nNikolai Petrovitch perceived Bazarov to be for remaining behind.\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch,\" he said, \"I would beg of you to attend my brother\\nuntil a doctor can be procured from the town.\"\\n\\nBazarov nodded in silence.\\n\\nAn hour later Paul Petrovitch was reposing in bed with his leg neatly\\nand artistically bandaged. The whole house was in a turmoil, Thenichka\\ngreatly upset, and Nikolai able to do nothing but wring his hands. The\\nsick man, on the contrary, laughed and jested, especially with Bazarov,\\nand, to meet the occasion, had donned a fine linen shirt, an elegant\\nmorning jacket, and a Turkish fez. Lastly, he forbade any one to close\\nthe shutters, and kept venting humorous protests against the necessity\\nof abstaining from food.\\n\\nTowards nightfall, however, fever supervened, and his head began to\\nache; with the result that when the doctor arrived from the town\\n(Nikolai Petrovitch had disobeyed his brother in this respect, and\\nBazarov also had consented to his doing so, in that, after paying the\\npatient a single visit, and that a very brief one, and being put to\\nthe mortification of having to avoid Thenichka on two occasions when\\nhe met her, he had felt that he preferred to spend the rest of the day\\nin loneliness, bitterness, and rancour)--when the doctor arrived from\\nthe town he advised a cooling draught, but at the same time confirmed\\nBazarov\\'s opinion that no danger was to be apprehended. In passing, it\\nmay also be mentioned that, on being informed by Nikolai Petrovitch\\nthat Paul Petrovitch\\'s wound had been self-inflicted through an\\naccident, the said doctor replied \"H\\'m!\"; to which, on receiving into\\nhis hand a fee of twenty-five roubles, he added that of course things\\nof the kind often occurred.\\n\\nNo one in the house, that night, retired to bed, or even undressed,\\nbut at intervals Nikolai Petrovitch would tiptoe into his brother\\'s\\nroom, and as silently withdraw. At intervals, too, Paul Petrovitch\\nwould awake from a doze, sigh faintly, and say to Nikolai either\\n\"_Couchez-vous_\" or \"Please give me a drink.\" But once it happened that\\nNikolai sent the invalid a glass of lemonade by the hand of Thenichka;\\nand this time Paul Petrovitch scanned her long and searchingly before\\ndraining the tumbler to the dregs. Towards morning the fever increased\\na little, and a trace of lightheadedness made its appearance which\\nfor a while caused the patient only to utter disconnected words.\\nBut suddenly he opened his eyes, and, on seeing his brother bending\\nsolicitously over the bed, murmured:\\n\\n\"Nikolai, do not you think that Thenichka slightly resembles Nelly?\"\\n\\n\"What Nelly, Paul? Who is Nelly?\"\\n\\n\"How can you ask? The Princess R., of course. In the upper portion of\\nthe face especially Thenichka resembles her. _C\\'est de la même famille_.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch made no reply. He could only remain lost in wonder\\nthat bygone fancies could so survive in the human consciousness.\\n\\n\"That _this_ should have cropped up again!\" he reflected.\\n\\nOn another occasion Paul Petrovitch muttered as he clasped his hands\\nbehind his head: \"How I love this idle existence!\" And again, a few\\nminutes later, he whispered: \"I will not allow a single rascal to touch\\nme!\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch sighed. To whom the words referred he had not a\\nnotion.\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock next morning Bazarov entered Nikolai\\'s room. His stock\\nof insects, birds, and frogs had either been packed up or liberated.\\n\\nRising to meet him, Nikolai said:\\n\\n\"So you have come to say good-bye?\"\\n\\n\"I have.\"\\n\\n\"I understand your feelings, and I commend them. I know that my poor\\nbrother alone was to blame, and is now paying the penalty. Also, I\\ngather from what he says that your position was such that you could not\\npossibly have acted otherwise than as you did--that for you to have\\navoided this duel would have been impossible. That being so, we must\\nattribute the mischance to the--er--standing antagonism of your views\"\\n(here Nikolai Petrovitch tripped over his words a little). \"My brother\\nis one of the old school, a man of hot temper and great persistency.\\nConsequently we have God to thank that things have turned out no worse.\\nFinally I may say that every possible precaution against publicity has\\nbeen taken.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said Bazarov carelessly. \"But I will leave my address with\\nyou, in case of anything occurring.\"\\n\\n\"I hope that nothing _will_ occur. Indeed, my one regret is that your\\nstay in my house should have--should have terminated in such a fashion.\\nAnd I am the more grieved in that Arkady---\"\\n\\n\"I expect to be seeing him very soon,\" interrupted Bazarov, whom\\n\"explanations\" or \"speeches\" of any kind always roused to fever pitch.\\n\"On the other hand, should I _not_ do so, pray convey to him my\\ngreetings and my regrets.\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" said Nikolai Petrovitch with a bow; but even before he had\\nfinished Bazarov had left the room.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch, too, as soon as he heard that Bazarov was on the point\\nof departing, expressed a desire to see him, and to shake hands with\\nhim. Yet Bazarov remained as cold as ice, for well he knew that Paul\\nPetrovitch\\'s only aim was to make a show of \"magnanimity,\" while to\\nThenichka he did not say good-bye at all--he merely exchanged with her\\na glance as she peeped from one of the windows. Her face looked to him\\ncareworn.\\n\\n\"Before long she will either trip or elope,\" he reflected.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Peter was so moved at the prospect of parting\\nwith his patron that he wept on the latter\\'s shoulder until his\\ntransports were cooled with the question: \"Surely your eyes are not\\nmade of water?\" while Duniasha\\'s emotion was such that she had to take\\nrefuge in a thicket. Meanwhile the cause of all this grief mounted\\nthe travelling-cart, and lit a cigar; and even when he had travelled\\nfour versts, and reached a spot where a turn in the road brought\\nthe Kirsanov farm into line with the new manor-house, he merely\\nexpectorated some tobacco juice, and muttered, as he wrapped himself\\ncloser in his cloak: \"The cursed tomnoddies!\"\\n\\nThenceforth Paul Petrovitch began to mend, but still was ordered to\\nkeep his bed for another week. What he called his \"imprisonment\"\\nhe bore with very fair patience, although he remained fussy in the\\nmatter of his toilet, and constantly had himself sprinkled with\\neau-de-Cologne. Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovitch read aloud to him the\\nnewspapers, and Thenichka served him with soup, lemonade, scrambled\\neggs, and tea. Yet she never entered the room without feeling a\\nmysterious nervousness come over her. Paul Petrovitch\\'s unexpected\\nbehaviour had frightened every one in the house, but her it had\\nfrightened most of all. Only old Prokofitch seemed undismayed at the\\noccurrence, and kept asserting that, in his day, \"the gentry used to\\nbore holes in one another right enough, but only the gentry. Jackanapes\\nlike that Bazarov would have been ducked in the gutter for their pains.\"\\n\\nThenichka felt little pricking of conscience, but there were times when\\nthe thought of the true cause of the quarrel rendered her at least\\nuneasy, and the more so because Paul Petrovitch\\'s way of looking at\\nher was now so strange that, even when she turned her back to him, she\\ncould still feel his eyes upon her. In combination, therefore, her\\nworries led to her growing thinner, and also (as often happens in such\\ncircumstances) to her adding to her beauty.\\n\\nAt length, one morning, Paul Petrovitch felt so much better that he\\nleft his bed, and removed to the sofa; while Nikolai Petrovitch, after\\nseeing that he had all he wanted, betook himself to the farm. Also,\\nit fell to Thenichka\\'s lot to take the invalid a cup of tea; and when\\nshe had placed it on the table, she was about to withdraw, when Paul\\nPetrovitch requested her to remain.\\n\\n\"Why should you hurry away?\" he said. \"Is it that you have other things\\nto do?\"\\n\\n\"No--yes. That is to say, I have to go and pour out tea for the\\nservants.\"\\n\\n\"Duniasha can do that. Surely you will stay awhile with a sick man who\\nhas something of great importance to say to you?\"\\n\\nSilently she seated herself on the edge of a chair.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" he continued, as he tugged at his moustache.\\n\\n\"For some time past I have been wanting to ask you why you are so\\nafraid of me?\"\\n\\n\"Afraid of you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; for you never look at me. In fact, one would think that your\\nconscience was uneasy.\"\\n\\nHer face reddened, but she looked Paul Petrovitch straight in the eyes.\\nSomehow his aspect struck her as peculiar, and her heart began to throb.\\n\\n\"Is your conscience clear?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, Why should it not be?\" she responded in a whisper.\\n\\n\"I do not know. Certainly I can recall no one against whom you can have\\ncommitted a fault. Against me? It is scarcely probable. Against others\\nin this house? That is as improbable. Against my brother? But him you\\nlove, do you not?\"\\n\\n\"I do.\"\\n\\n\"With your whole heart and soul?\"\\n\\n\"With my whole heart and soul.\"\\n\\n\"Really and truly, Thenichka?\" (never before had he addressed her\\nthus). \"Look me in the eyes. To lie is a terrible sin. You know that,\\nof course?\"\\n\\n\"But I am _not_ lying, Paul Petrovitch. Did I not love Nikolai\\nPetrovitch, I should not want to live.\"\\n\\n\"And you would exchange him for no one else?\"\\n\\n\"_Whom_ should I exchange him for?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. Surely not for the gentlemen who has just left us?\"\\n\\nThenichka rose to her feet.\\n\\n\"Why should you torment me in this way?\" she cried. \"What have I done\\nthat you should speak to me so?\"\\n\\n\"Thenichka,\" came the mournful reply, \"I speak to you in this manner\\nfor the reason that I saw----\"\\n\\n\"You saw what?\"\\n\\n\"I saw _you_--in the lilac arbour.\"\\n\\nShe blushed to her ears, to the very roots of her hair.\\n\\n\"But how was I to blame?\" at length she contrived to say.\\n\\nPaul Petrovitch raised himself on the sofa.\\n\\n\"You swear, do you, that you were _not_ to blame?\" he said. \"That you\\nwere not in the slightest degree to blame? Not at all?\"\\n\\n\"I love Nikolai Petrovitch,\" came the reply, delivered with sudden\\nenergy and a rising sob, \"and never shall I love any other man. As\\nfor what you saw, before the Throne of Judgment I swear that I am\\ninnocent, that I have always been so, and that I would rather die than\\nbe suspected of having deceived Nikolai Petrovitch, my benefactor.\"\\n\\nHer voice failed her. Then, behold! she felt Paul seize and press\\nher hand! Turning her head, she looked down at him--and stood almost\\npetrified. For his face was even paler than usual, his eyes were\\nglistening, and--most surprising thing of all!--a great tear was\\ntrickling down his cheek!\\n\\n\"Thenichka,\" he whispered in a voice which hardly seemed his own, \"I\\nbeg of you always to love, and never to cease loving, my brother. He\\nis such a good, kind fellow as has not his equal in the world. Never\\ndesert him for another; never listen to any tales which you may hear of\\nhim, but reflect how terrible it would be for him to love and not to be\\nloved! Yes, think well, Thenichka, before ever you forsake him.\"\\n\\nThenichka\\'s amazement caused her eyes almost to start from her\\nhead, and her nervousness completely to vanish. Judge, also, of her\\nsurprise when, though he did not draw her to himself, nor kiss her,\\nPaul Petrovitch raised her hand to his lips, and then burst into a\\nconvulsive fit of sobbing!\\n\\n\"God in Heaven!\" she thought to herself. \"What if this should make him\\nhave another fainting fit?\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, in that one moment Paul Petrovitch was living over again a\\npast phase of his ruined life.\\n\\nPresently hurried footsteps were heard causing the staircase to creak;\\nand just as Paul pushed Thenichka away from him and replaced his head\\nupon the pillow, the door opened, and Nikolai Petrovitch--fresh, ruddy,\\nand smiling--entered with little Mitia. The latter, equally fresh and\\nruddy, was leaping in Nikolai\\'s arms, and pressing his tiny, naked feet\\nagainst the buttons of his father\\'s rural smock.\\n\\nRunning to father and child, Thenichka threw her arms around both\\nalike, and sank her head upon the former\\'s shoulder. This caused him to\\nhalt in amazement, for never before had the bashful, reserved Thenichka\\nshown him any endearment in the presence of a third person.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" he exclaimed. Then he glanced at Paul, handed\\nMitia to Thenichka, and, approaching the bedside, inquired if his\\nbrother were worse.\\n\\nPaul\\'s face was buried in his handkerchief, but he replied:\\n\\n\"Oh dear no. Not at all. If anything, I am better--yes, very much\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless you have been over-hasty in removing to the sofa,\" said\\nNikolai Petrovitch; after which he turned to ask Thenichka why she was\\nleaving the room, but she departed abruptly, and closed the door behind\\nher.\\n\\n\"I had come to show you my little rascal,\" Nikolai continued. \"He had\\nbeen pining for a sight of his uncle. But she has carried him away for\\nsome reason. What is the matter? Has something occurred?\"\\n\\n\"My brother,\" replied Paul Petrovitch--and as he uttered the words\\nNikolai Petrovitch gave a start, and felt ill at ease, he knew not why.\\n\"My brother, pray give me your word of honour that you will fulfil the\\nrequest which I am going to make.\"\\n\\n\"What request, Paul? I beg of you to continue.\"\\n\\n\"A request of the first importance. Upon it, I believe, your entire\\nhappiness depends. Also, what I am going to say represents the fruit of\\nmuch thought. My brother, the request is that you will do your duty,\\nthe duty of a good and honourable man. In other words, I beseech you to\\nput an end to this scandal and bad example, which is unworthy of you,\\nunworthy of a man who is the best of souls.\"\\n\\n\"To what do you refer, Paul?\"\\n\\n\"To this. You ought to _marry_ Thenichka. She loves you, and is the\\nmother of your child.\"\\n\\nStepping back, Nikolai Petrovitch clasped his hands together.\\n\\n\"Do _you_ say this?\" he exclaimed. \"Do _you_ say this--_you_ whom I\\nhave always understood to be opposed to such unions? Do _you_ say this?\\nSurely you know that solely out of respect for yourself have I hitherto\\nrefrained from doing what rightfully you call my duty?\"\\n\\n\"Wrongfully, then, have you respected me,\" said Paul Petrovitch with a\\nsad smile. \"In fact, almost I am beginning to think that Bazarov was\\nright when he accused me of only feigning the aristocratic instinct.\\nFor it is not enough for you and me to trouble ourselves about worldly\\nmatters alone. We are old men past our prime, who ought to lay aside\\nall pettinesses, and to fulfil strictly our obligations. Nor forget\\nthat, should we thus act, we shall receive an added measure of\\nhappiness as our reward.\"\\n\\nNikolai Petrovitch flung himself upon his brother, and embraced him\\nagain and again.\\n\\n\"You have opened my eyes,\" he cried. \"When I described you as the best\\nman in the world I was not wrong: and now I perceive your wisdom to be\\nequal to your magnanimity.\"\\n\\n\"Quieter, quieter!\" advised Paul. \"Do not further inflame the leg of an\\nold fool who, at fifty, has fought a duel like a young ensign. Then the\\nmatter is settled, and Thenichka is to become my _belle-soeur_?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dearest Paul. But what will Arkady say?\"\\n\\n\"Arkady? He will be delighted. True, marriage does not come within his\\npurview or principles, but at least his sense of social equality will\\nbe tickled. And, in the nineteenth century, what does caste matter?\"\\n\\n\"Paul, Paul, let me embrace you once more. You need not be afraid.\\nI will do it very carefully.\" And the two brothers flung their arms\\naround one another.\\n\\n\"Well?\" continued Paul Petrovitch. \"What think you? Shall we tell her\\nat once?\"\\n\\n\"No, we need not be in too much of a hurry,\" replied Nikolai\\nPetrovitch. \"As a matter of fact, you have been having a talk with her,\\nhave you not?\"\\n\\n\"I have been having a talk with her? _Quelle idée!_\"\\n\\n\"However, your first business is to recover. Thenichka will not run\\naway, and in the meanwhile the affair must be carefully considered.\"\\n\\n\"Then you have decided upon it?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I have! And I thank you with all my heart. But I must\\nleave you for a while now, for you ought to have some rest, and any\\nexcitement is bad for you. Matters can be discussed later. Go to sleep,\\ndearest of brothers, and may God restore you to health!\"\\n\\n\"Why did he thank _me_?\" thought Paul Petrovitch to himself after\\nNikolai had gone.\" Does not the affair depend upon him alone, seeing\\nthat, after the marriage, I myself shall have to depart elsewhere--to\\nDresden or to Florence, and to abide there until I die?\"\\n\\nHe bathed his forehead with eau-de-Cologne, and then closed his eyes.\\nAs he lay with his handsome, refined head resting on the pillow, he\\nlooked, in the clear light of the sun, like a corpse.\\n\\n\\n[1] Ann Radcliffe, _née_ Ward (1764-1823), an English novelist who\\nwrote _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ and other tales, and travelled\\nextensively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV\\n\\n\\nIn the shade of a tall ash tree in the garden at Nikolsköe Katia\\nand Arkady were seated on a bench. Beside them, on the ground, lay\\nFifi--his lengthy body twisted into the curve known to sporting folk\\nas \"the hare\\'s crouch.\" Neither from Arkady nor from Katia was a word\\nproceeding. Arkady was holding in his hands a half-opened book, and she\\nwas picking a few crumbs from a basket, and throwing them to a small\\nfamily of sparrows which, with the timid temerity of their tribe, were\\nchirping and hopping at her very feet. A faint breeze was stirring\\nthe leaves of the ash tree, and dappling Fifi\\'s tawny back and the\\ndark line of the pathway with a number of wavering circles of pale\\ngolden light; but Arkady and Katia were wholly in shade, save that an\\noccasional streak glanced upon, and gleamed in, her hair. Just for the\\nreason that the pair were silent and side by side was there present\\nto their consciousness a _camaraderie_ which, while causing neither\\nto have the other definitely in mind, pleased each with the sense of\\nthe other\\'s propinquity. The expression of both is changed since last\\nwe saw them. Arkady\\'s face wears a staider air, and Katia looks more\\nanimated and less retiring.\\n\\nAt length, however, Arkady spoke.\\n\\n\"Do you not think,\" he said, \"that our Russian term _yasen_ is\\nparticularly suitable to the ash tree? For no other tree cleaves the\\nair with such airy brightness.\"(1) Katia looked up.\\n\\n\"I agree,\" she replied, while Arkady proudly reflected: \"At all events\\n_she_ does not reprove me for talking in \\'beautiful language.\\'\"\\n\\n\"By the way,\" Katia continued with a glance at the book in his hands,\\n\"I cannot say that I always approve of Heine. I like him neither when\\nhe is laughing nor when he is in tears--I like him only when he is\\nmeditative and languid.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I like him when he is laughing,\" Arkady remarked.\\n\\n\"Then still there survives in you a trace of your old satirical\\ntendency. Still your reformation needs to be completed.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" thought Arkady. \"My satirical tendency? Oh, that Bazarov\\ncould have heard that!\"\\n\\nWhile aloud he said:\\n\\n\"Who is \\'we\\'? Yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear no! My sister, and Porfiri Platonitch, with whom you no longer\\nquarrel, and my aunt, whom, three days ago, you escorted to church.\"\\n\\n\"I did so only because I could not refuse. And as regards Anna\\nSergievna, kindly remember that, in many things, she agrees with\\nBazarov.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she used to be greatly under his influence, and so did you.\"\\n\\n\"And so did I? Then am I now emancipated from that influence?\"\\n\\nKatia returned no reply.\\n\\n\"I know that you never liked him,\" Arkady continued.\\n\\n\"Did I not? It was not for me to judge him.\"\\n\\n\"Never do I hear that reply without declining to believe it. There is\\nnot a person living whom _all_ of us have not the right to judge. A\\ndisclaimer of that kind always represents an excuse.\"\\n\\n\"To tell the truth, I disliked him less than I felt him to be a\\nstranger to me--as complete a one as I to him--or you either, for that\\nmatter.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean that--well, how can I express it? That, whereas he was a wild\\nbird, you and I are tame ones.\"\\n\\n\"_I_ am a tame one?\"\\n\\nKatia nodded assent. Arkady scratched his ear.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" he said. \"I may tell you that that constitutes, in\\nessence, an insult.\"\\n\\n\"Why so? Do you _want_ to be a wild bird?\"\\n\\n\"Not necessarily a wild one, but at least one strong and energetic.\"\\n\\n\"You need wish no such thing. Your friend was both, yet he would rather\\nhave been otherwise.\\n\\n\"H\\'m! You believe that he used to exercise a considerable influence\\nover Anna Sergievna?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But no one can hold a rein over her for long.\" Katia added this\\nlast _sotto voce._\\n\\n\"What makes you think that?\"\\n\\n\"The fact that she is very proud--rather, that she values her\\nindependence.\"\\n\\n\"Who does not?\" queried Arkady, while there flashed through his mind\\nthe thought: \"Why this mention of her?\" Curiously enough, the same\\nthought occurred to Katia too. But this was not so curious as might\\nhave been supposed, seeing that when young people meet in frequent and\\namicable converse, identical thoughts are apt to enter their brains.\\n\\nArkady smiled, edged nearer to Katia, and said in a whisper: \"Confess\\nthat you are a little afraid of her.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom?\"\\n\\n\"Of _her_\" repeated Arkady meaningly.\\n\\n\"_Are you_ afraid of her?\" countered Katia.\\n\\n\"I am. Please note that I believe you to be the same.\"\\n\\nKatia raised a menacing finger.\\n\\n\"I am surprised at you!\" she exclaimed. \"Never at any time has my\\nsister been better disposed towards you than she is now. She likes you\\nconsiderably more than when you first came.\"\\n\\n\"Really?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. And have you not noticed it? You ought to be pleased at the\\nnotion.\"\\n\\nArkady reflected.\\n\\n\"How I have contrived to win Anna Sergievna\\'s good graces I do not\\nknow,\" at length he said. \"Surely it cannot be because I brought her\\nthose letters which were written by your mother?\"\\n\\n\"It is, though, and because of other reasons as well--reasons which I\\nwill forbear to mention.\"\\n\\n\"Why will you?\"\\n\\n\"Because I will.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know your faculty for obstinacy.\"\\n\\n\"It is one which I possess.\"\\n\\n\"Also, your faculty for observing things.\"\\n\\nKatia glanced at him. Then she inquired:\\n\\n\"Why lose your temper? What are you thinking of?\"\\n\\n\"This: that I cannot understand how you come to possess those powers\\nof observation which undoubtedly are yours. I understand it the less\\nbecause you are so nervous and distrustful and shy of everybody and----\"\\n\\n\"It is because I have lived such a lonely life. A life of that kind\\nleads one to reflect in spite of oneself. Am I shy of _every_ one,\\nthough?\"\\n\\nArkady bestowed upon her an appreciative glance.\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" he said. \"At all events it is not often that people in\\nyour position--I mean, people of your wealth--possess such a gift. To\\nthem, as to the Tsars, truth penetrates hardly.\"\\n\\n\"But I am _not_ wealthy.\"\\n\\nArkady failed at first to follow her meaning, but reflected: \"Certainly\\nthe property belongs to her sister, not to her.\" Nor was the thought\\nwholly unpleasing--so little so that presently he added:\\n\\n\"You said that very prettily.\"\\n\\n\"I said what?\"\\n\\n\"That you are not wealthy. You said it so simply, so without any\\nfalse shame, so without the least _arrière pensée. Apropos_, the\\nconsciousness of the ordinary person who both knows and confesses that\\nhe or she is poor always seems to me to contain more than the mere\\nwords imply--it harbours also a touch of vanity.\"\\n\\n\"I have, thanks to my sister, had no experience of poverty. And as\\nfor my possessions, I mentioned them only because the words came of\\nthemselves to my lips.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so. Yet confess that you too harbour a grain of the vanity to\\nwhich I have alluded.\"\\n\\n\"Give me an example of my doing so.\"\\n\\n\"An example? Well, may I ask why you have not married a rich man?\"\\n\\n\"Were I to love such a one very much, I----But no man of that sort has\\ncome my way: wherefore I have made no such marriage.\"\\n\\n\"There, now!\" cried Arkady. \"But why should you not do so in the\\nfuture?\"\\n\\n\"Because even the poets deprecate _mésalliances._\"\\n\\n\"You mean that you wish either to rule or----?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no! What good would that be? On the contrary, I am prepared to be\\nruled, even though I believe that inequality in any form works badly. A\\nunion of self-respect with submission--that is what I best understand,\\nthat is what spells true happiness. A mere subordinate existence\\nis--well, something which I do not fancy.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Something which I do not fancy,\\'\" commented Arkady. \"Yes, you are of\\nthe same blood as Anna Sergievna: you are as independent as she, and\\nyou are even more secretive. In fact, however deep-rooted and sacred\\na stock of sentiments you might hold, you would never, of your own\\naccord, give them utterance.\"\\n\\n\"Of course! How could you suppose anything else?\"\\n\\n\"Also, you are clever, and have a measure of character equal to, if not\\ngreater than, hers.\"\\n\\n\"I dislike being compared with my sister. You seem to have forgotten\\nthat she is both \\'beautiful\\' and \\'intellectual\\' and---- Moreover, you,\\nabove all people, ought not to say anything to her disparagement, and\\nstill less to say it seriously.\"\\n\\n\"Why \\'_you_, above all people\\'? Do you think that I am jesting?\"\\n\\n\"I am certain of it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? But what if I were to say that I really mean my words? What if\\nI were to say that, if anything, I have under-expressed what is in my\\nmind?\"\\n\\n\"I fail to follow you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you? Your quickness of perception has been overrated.\"\\n\\n\"Why has it?\"\\n\\nAverting his head, Arkady returned no reply, while Katia fell to\\nsearching for the last crumbs in her basket, and throwing them to the\\nsparrows. Unfortunately, the throw of her arm proved too strong, and\\nthe birds flew away without even touching the food offered them.\\n\\n\"Katia,\" said Arkady, \"it may be that you look upon these things as\\nmatters of no moment. Kindly note, therefore, that neither for your\\nsister nor for any other person would I exchange Mademoiselle Katerina\\nSergievna.\"\\n\\nRising, he walked away as though in sudden alarm at having allowed the\\nwords to escape his lips. Meanwhile Katia, with her hands resting upon\\nthe basket and her head bent, gazed after him. Gradually there crept\\ninto her cheeks a rosy tint; and though her lips were not smiling, and\\nher dark eyes contained a hint of perplexity, there lurked also in her\\nexpression another unexpressed feeling.\\n\\n\"Are you alone?\" said Anna Sergievna\\'s voice from behind her. \"I\\nthought that Arkady came with you into the garden?\"\\n\\nKatia slowly raised her eyes to her sister (tastefully, and even\\nshowily, dressed, the latter was standing on the path, and engaged in\\nstirring Fin\\'s ears with the point of an open parasol), and as slowly\\nreplied:\\n\\n\"Yes--I am alone.\"\\n\\n\"So I see,\" commented Madame with a smile. \"He has gone indoors, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n\\n\"Probably.\"\\n\\n\"And you have been reading with him?\"\\n\\n\"I have.\"\\n\\nAnna Sergievna took Katia under the chin, and raised her face towards\\nher own.\\n\\n\"You have not quarrelled, I hope?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" said Katia, and quietly put away her sister\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"What solemn replies! Well, I came here to propose a walk, since he is\\nalways asking me to go one. But, to pass to another subject, some shoes\\nhave arrived for you from the town, so _you_ had better go and try them\\non. Only yesterday I was noticing how shabby your old ones are. In\\ngeneral, you do not take sufficient pains in such matters, for you have\\ncharming feet, and also not ugly hands, even though a trifle too large.\\nYou ought to take care of your feet. When you are here you do not do so\\nsufficiently.\"\\n\\nMadame passed onwards with a light rustle of her handsome gown, while\\nKatia rose from the bench, and, taking the volume of Heine, departed in\\nanother direction--though _not_ to try on the boots.\\n\\n\"\\'You have charming feet,\\'\" she repeated to herself as she tripped up\\nthe sun-baked steps of the terrace. \"\\'You have charming feet.\\' Well,\\nbefore long some one shall be at them.\"\\n\\nConfusion then overcame her, and she took the remaining steps at a\\nbound.\\n\\nMeanwhile Arkady made for his room. As he was passing through the hall\\nhe was overtaken by the butler, and informed that Monsieur Bazarov was\\nawaiting him above.\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch?\" exclaimed Arkady in a tone very much as of alarm.\\n\"Has he been here long?\"\\n\\n\"A few minutes only. He instructed me not to announce him to Madame but\\nto take him straight to your room.\"\\n\\n\"I hope that nothing unfortunate has occurred at home,\" reflected\\nArkady as he ran up the stairs and opened the door of the bedroom. But\\nthe first sight of Bazarov\\'s face reassured him, even though a more\\nexperienced eye might have detected in the features of the unlooked-for\\nguest certain signs that inward turmoil underlay their usual rigidity.\\nClad in a dust cloak and a travelling cap, he was seated on the\\nwindow-sill, and did not rise even when, rushing towards him with\\nexclamations of astonishment, and fussing to and fro like a man who\\nbelieves himself to be overjoyed, as well as desires other people to\\nbelieve it, Arkady cried:\\n\\n\"What a surprise! What has brought you here? Surely everything at home\\nis well, and all are in good health?\"\\n\\n\"Everything at your home is well,\" said Bazarov; \"but all are not in\\ngood health. However, if your brains are not hopelessly wandering,\\nfirst tell them to bring me some _kvass_, and then sit down and listen\\nto my few but, I hope, well-chosen words.\"\\n\\nThis quieted Arkady, and upon that Bazarov told him of the duel with\\nPaul Petrovitch. The recital finished, Arkady stood amazed, as well as\\ndistressed. But this he did not think it necessary to state--he merely\\ninquired whether his uncle\\'s wound were really a harmless one, and, on\\nreceiving the reply that it was of a nature uninteresting from every\\nbut the medical point of view, forced a smile. Yet all the while he\\nfelt secretly hurt, and also secretly ashamed. This Bazarov seemed to\\ndivine.\\n\\n\"See,\" he said, \"what comes of consorting with feudal folk! Should\\none\\'s lot be cast among them, inevitably one gets drawn into their\\nknightly tourneys. Being on my way to my parents\\' place, I have turned\\naside to But no; I will not be guilty of a foolish and useless lie. The\\nreal reason why I have turned aside is that--oh, the devil only knows\\nwhy! Times there are when a man ought to take himself by the scruff of\\nthe neck, and uproot himself like a radish from a garden border. That\\nis what _I_ did when I was last here. But, since, a longing has come\\nupon me to take just another peep at all that I then forsook--to view\\nonce more the border where I used to grow.\"\\n\\n\"By the words \\'all that I then forsook\\' I hope that you do not mean\\nmyself as well?\" cried Arkady anxiously. \"Do not say that you intend to\\nsever me also from your friendship?\"\\n\\nBazarov looked at him. He did so fixedly, almost sharply.\\n\\n\"Would the eventuality distress you?\" he inquired. \"Rather, it is you\\nwho have forsaken me, O verdant and transparent soul. _Inter alia_, I\\nhope that your affair with Anna Sergievna is progressing?\"\\n\\n\"My \\'affair with Anna Sergievna\\'?\"\\n\\n\"For her sake, was it not, you came hither from the town? Ah, tender\\nyoung chicken of mine, what about those Sunday Schools? Come, come!\\nDo not tell me that you are not in love with her. Or have you at last\\nlearnt to be secretive?\"\\n\\n\"Always I have been frank with you, as you know; wherefore pray believe\\nme when I say--I call God to witness that it is true--that your\\nsurmises are mistaken.\"\\n\\n\"Truly a new song!\" remarked Bazarov _sotto voce._\\n\\n\"But do not disturb yourself: it is all one to me. Certainly, a\\nRomanticist would have said: \\'Our roads are beginning to diverge\\'; but\\nI say no more than that clearly we have no further use for one another.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Evgenii!\"\\n\\n\"Dear lad, it is no misfortune. At all times is something in the world\\nfinding out that it has no use for something else. So we must say\\ngood-bye. Ever since I arrived in this place I have been feeling as\\nuncomfortable as a Governor\\'s lady when she hears a work of Gogol\\'s\\nread aloud. In fact, I did not order my horses to be unharnessed.\"\\n\\n\"But you cannot act like this!\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because, apart from my own feelings, such a speedy departure would be\\nthe height of rudeness to Anna Sergievna. I know that she would like to\\nsee you.\"\\n\\n\"No, she would not.\"\\n\\n\"I am positive that she would. Why pretend like this? Are you going to\\nsay that it is not for her sake alone that you are here?\"\\n\\n\"You have grounds for that surmise, yet I say that you are wrong.\"\\n\\nBut Arkady proved to be right, for Anna Sergievna really desired to see\\nBazarov, and, through the butler, sent him word to that effect. After\\ntidying his costume, therefore, and tucking his new great-coat under\\nhis arm (in readiness to depart as soon as the interview should be\\nconcluded), he went downstairs, and was received, not in the room where\\nhe had unexpectedly disclosed his passion, but in the drawing-room.\\nAnna Sergievna\\'s manner, as she offered him the tips of her fingers,\\nwas pleasant enough, yet her face betrayed involuntary tension.\\n\\n\"To begin with,\" Bazarov hastened to say, \"allow me to reassure you.\\nYou see before you a corpse which has long returned to its senses, and\\nis also not destitute of hope that others have forgotten its folly. I\\nam unlikely to see you again for an extended period, but, though (as\\nyou know) I am not given to sentiment, I feel that I should like to\\nbear away with me the thought that my image still fills your mind with\\naversion.\"\\n\\nShe caught at her breath like a person who has just arrived at the\\nsummit of a lofty mountain. Then her face lightened into a smile, and,\\noffering Bazarov her hand a second time, she allowed it to respond to\\nthe pressure of his.\\n\\n\"When sorrow is asleep, do not wake it,\" she said. \"And the less so\\nsince my conscience convicts me, if not of coquetry on that occasion,\\nat all events of something else. One word more. Let us be friends\\nagain. For it was all a dream, was it not? And who remembers dreams?\"\\n\\n\"Who indeed? And love--well, love is a mere empirical sentiment.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to hear you say so.\"\\n\\nThus Anna Sergievna, and thus Bazarov. And both conceived themselves to\\nbe speaking the truth. But was it the truth?--at all events, the whole\\ntruth? The speakers themselves did not know, and therefore the author\\ndoes not. Nevertheless both the man and the woman framed their words to\\ncreate an atmosphere of mutual confidence.\\n\\nNext Anna Sergievna asked Bazarov how he had spent his time at the\\nKirsanovs\\'; and though he came within an ace of telling her of the duel\\nwith Paul Petrovitch, he checked himself in time, and replied that he\\nhad been engaged in work.\\n\\n\"And I,\" she said, \"have been, for some unknown reason, out of humour,\\nand meditating going abroad; but the fit is passing now (thanks to the\\narrival of your friend Arkady Nikolaievitch), and already I find myself\\nrelapsing into my old rut, and resuming my true rôle.\"\\n\\n\"And what is your true rôle?\"\\n\\n\"The rôle of acting as aunt or preceptress or mother--call it what you\\nlike--to my sister. In passing, I wonder if you are aware that once\\nupon a time I did not altogether understand your close friendship with\\nArkady Nikolaievitch? Somehow he seemed too insignificant for you. But\\nnow, I know him better, and have convinced myself that in his head\\nthere is a brain. Above all things, he is young, young--not like you\\nand myself, Evgenii Vasilitch.\"\\n\\n\"But he is still shy in your presence?\" queried Bazarov.\\n\\n\"He\" began Anna Sergievna; then, checking herself, continued: \"No; he\\nis gaining confidence, and has taken to talking to me quite freely;\\nwhereas once upon a time, though I did not seek his company, he used\\nto flee whenever I came near him. By the way, he is great friends with\\nKatia.\"\\n\\nSomehow this irritated Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Never can a woman forbear dissembling,\" was his reflection. Aloud he\\nsaid with a frigid smile: \"Then you say that he used to flee from you?\\nBut surely it cannot be a secret that formerly he cherished for you\\n_une grande passion?\"_\\n\\n\"What? He too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he too,\" affirmed Bazarov with a nod. \"But I think that you knew\\nthat? It was not a piece of news that I have just told you?\"\\n\\nHer eyes became fixed upon the floor.\\n\\n\"I believe you to be wrong,\" she observed.\\n\\n\"So do not I. But perhaps I ought not to have mentioned it?\" To himself\\nhe added: \"And perhaps you will not, in future, play the hypocrite with\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Why should you not have mentioned it?\" she queried. \"As a matter\\nof fact, I believe you to be attaching importance to a mere passing\\nimpression, and shall soon think that you have a tendency to\\nexaggerate.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose we talk of something else?\" he suggested.\\n\\n\"For what reason?\"\\n\\nHowever, of her own accord she diverted the conversation into another\\nchannel. True, she had assured him, and she herself believed, that\\neverything was buried in the past; yet she felt ill at ease, and\\nconscious that, even while jesting or exchanging the merest of\\n_bagatelles,_ she had weighing upon her a nervous oppression. In fact,\\nit was akin to the case of passengers afloat. Though such folk will\\nlaugh and talk with the same apparent indifference as on land, let but\\nthe machinery stop, or the least sign of anything unusual appear, and\\nat once every face will display that peculiar expression of anxiety\\nwhich comes only of constant knowledge of ever-present danger.\\n\\nOf similar sort was Anna Sergievna\\'s interview with Bazarov; nor was\\nit prolonged, in that soon she began to feel so absent-minded, and to\\nanswer with such vagueness, that she proposed a move to the hall, where\\nthere were found Katia and the Princess.\\n\\n\"And where is Arkady Nikolaievitch?\" inquired the hostess; and, on\\nbeing told that he had not been seen for over an hour, she sent\\nmessengers to summon him. But this proved a lengthy task, seeing that\\nhe had withdrawn to the remotest corner of the garden, and, sitting\\nwith chin upon hands, was plunged in thought. Those thoughts were\\nimportant and profound, but not sad; and though he knew that Anna\\nSergievna was alone with Bazarov, he felt none of his old jealousy,\\nbut, rather, gazed before him with quiet cheerfulness--with an air as\\nthough something had pleased and surprised him, and led him to arrive\\nat a certain decision.\\n\\n\\n[1] _ Yasen_ is derived from the adjective _yasni_, meaning clear or\\nbright.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI\\n\\n\\nAlthough the late Monsieur Odintsov had disliked \"innovations,\" he\\nhad not been opposed to the indulgence of \"a certain play of refined\\ntaste,\" and had erected, in a space between the hothouses and the lake,\\na building modelled in the style of a Greek temple, but consisting\\nof undeniable Russian bricks. Also, he had caused to be inserted in\\nthe massive rear wall of this temple or gallery six niches for six\\nstatues which were designed to represent Solitude, Silence, Thought,\\nMelancholy, Modesty, and Sensibility, and which he had purposed to\\nimport from abroad; but only one of these, the statue of the Goddess\\nof Silence, with a finger to her lips, had actually been delivered and\\nerected; and even of that the household underlings had knocked off the\\nnose on the very day of the statue\\'s arrival. True, a neighbouring\\nsculptor had offered to furnish the goddess with a nose \"twice as good\\nas the last one,\" but Odintsov had none the less ordered her removal to\\na corner of the millhouse, where for several years past she had acted\\nas a source of superstitious awe to the peasant women of the district.\\nLikewise, the front wall of the temple had become so overgrown with\\nbushes that only the capitals of the supporting columns remained\\nvisible above the mass of verdure, and even at midday the interior\\nof the building was cool and pleasant; and though Anna Sergievna had\\nnever really liked the place since the day when she had discovered an\\nadder there, Katia paid it frequent visits, and, seating herself on\\na great stone bench which was fixed under one of the niches, would\\nread or work, or surrender herself to the influence of that perfect\\nrestfulness which, known, probably, to every one, comes of a silent,\\nhalf-unconscious contemplation of the great waves of life as they\\nbreak for ever around and against us.\\n\\nOn the morning after Bazarov\\'s arrival Katia was in her usual position\\non the bench, and beside her was Arkady--he having specially asked her\\nto accompany him thither.\\n\\nThough an hour was still wanting to luncheon time, the dew and the\\nfreshness of the morning had already given place to the sultriness\\nand the aridity of noontide. Arkady\\'s face yet bore the expression\\nof yesterday, but Katia\\'s features were stamped with one, rather, of\\ndepression. This was because after breakfast her sister had called\\nher into the boudoir, and to some of those blandishments which always\\nalarmed the girl had added a word of advice that Katia should observe\\nmore caution in her converse with Arkady, and, above all things, avoid\\nsuch solitary _tête-à-têtes_ with him as appeared to have aroused\\nthe attention of the household in general, and of the Princess in\\nparticular. Since the previous evening Anna Sergievna had been out\\nof humour; and inasmuch as Katia\\'s conscience was not wholly clear\\nof responsibility in the matter, she had intimated, when yielding to\\nArkady\\'s request, that it must be for the last time.\\n\\n\"Katia,\" he began with a sort of easy uneasiness, \"since the day when I\\nhad the good fortune to reside under the same roof as yourself I have\\ntalked to you on many different subjects. But one particular question\\nhas for me a paramount importance: nor upon that question have I yet\\ntouched. Yesterday you said that during my stay here I have undergone\\na process of reformation\"--he neither sought nor avoided Katia\\'s\\neye--\"and, to be frank, such a reformation has, in part at least, come\\nabout. Better than any one else do you know that this is so--you to\\nwhom, above all others, that remaking is due.\"\\n\\n\"To me?\" she re-echoed.\\n\\n\"Yes, to you,\" Arkady repeated. \"No longer am I the presumptuous lad\\nwho came here a short while ago: not for nothing have I attained my\\ntwenty-third year. And though I still wish to be of use in life, though\\nI still wish to consecrate the whole of my faculties to the service of\\nTruth, I no longer seek my ideals where I was wont to do--they appear\\nto me to stand much nearer home. Hitherto I have been in ignorance of\\nmyself, hitherto I have set myself tasks beyond my powers; but now,\\nthrough a certain feeling which is within me, my eyes have become\\nopened. By the way, the manner in which I express myself may be lacking\\nin clarity, yet I venture to hope that I have made myself understood?\"\\n\\nKatia said nothing; but she ceased to look at the speaker.\\n\\n\"In my opinion,\" he went on in a tone of rising emotion, while in\\na birch tree overhead a chaffinch started pouring forth a flood of\\nunstudied song, \"in my opinion, it is the duty of an honourable man to\\nbe frank with those who, with those who--in short, with those who stand\\nnearest to him in life. Consequently I, I am minded to--to---\"\\n\\nHere Arkady\\'s eloquence failed him. He stumbled and stuttered and\\nhad to pause for a moment. Meanwhile Katia\\'s eyes remained lowered.\\nOne would have thought that she did not in the least understand this\\npreamble, but was expecting to hear something quite of a different\\nnature.\\n\\n\"That I shall surprise you I know in advance,\" continued Arkady, once\\nmore spurring his faculties. \"And that surprise will be the greater\\nwhen I tell you that the feeling to which I have alluded concerns, to a\\ncertain extent--yes, to a certain extent, yourself. For yesterday, you\\nwill remember, you imputed to me a lack of gravity \"--he was speaking\\nmuch like a man who, having blundered into a bog, feels that at each\\nstep he sinks deeper and deeper, yet struggles on in the hope of\\neventually extricating himself--\"and such a reproach is all too often\\nlevelled against, all too often falls upon, young people who have\\nceased to deserve it. Were I but possessed of more self-confidence\"\\n(\"God help me! God help me!\" he thought despairingly, but Katia did not\\neven turn her head)--\"had I but the right to hope that----\"\\n\\n\"Did I but feel sure that you really mean what you say,\" broke in, at\\nthis moment, the clear accents of Anna Sergievna.\\n\\nArkady became dumb, and Katia turned pale; for along a little path\\nwhich skirted the bushes screening the temple there were advancing\\nBazarov and Madame! Katia and Arkady could not actually see the pair,\\nyet they could hear every word uttered, and even catch the sound of\\ntheir breathing, and the rustle of Anna Sergievna\\'s dress. Advancing a\\nfew more steps, the couple halted, and remained standing in front of\\nthe building.\\n\\n\"It is like this,\" Anna Sergievna continued. \"You and I have blundered\\ninto an error. That is to say, while neither of us is in the heyday of\\nyouth--I so least of the two--and both of us have lived our fives and\\nare weary, we are also (for I need not stand on ceremony) individuals\\nof intellect. Consequently, though, at first, we interested one\\nanother, and felt our mutual curiosity aroused, it happened that\\nsubsequently----\"\\n\\n\"That subsequently I grew stale in your eyes,\" hazarded Bazarov.\\n\\n\"Oh no! That that was not the cause of the situation you are well\\naware. But, whatever the cause, you and I have not a _compelling need_\\nof one another. Therein lies the point. In other words, both of us have\\nin us--how shall I express it?--both of us are too mutually _akin._ We\\nwere slow to grasp that fact. Now, Arkady---\"\\n\\n\"Have you a \\'compelling need\\'--of him?\" put in Bazarov.\\n\\n\"For shame, Evgenii Vasilitch! You yourself have averred that he is\\nnot wholly indifferent to me; and I too have long suspected that he\\ncherishes for me at least a measure of admiration. As we are on the\\nsubject, I will not attempt to conceal from you that of late the fact\\nthat I am old enough to be his aunt has not prevented me from devoting\\nto him more of my thoughts than I used to do. In his fresh young\\nsentimentality there is a certain charm.\"\\n\\n\"The term \\'fascination\\' comes handier in such cases,\" said Bazarov in\\nthe deep, quiet tone which, with him, always signified sarcasm. \"As a\\nmatter of fact, I found Arkady secretive yesterday--he made but the\\nscantiest of references either to you or your sister. That constitutes\\nan important symptom.\"\\n\\n\"Katia and he are brother and sister to one another,\" said Madame.\\n\"Indeed I am pleased to see it--though perhaps I ought not to connive\\nat so much familiarity.\"\\n\\n\"I presume that the element speaking in you is the sister?\" drawled\\nBazarov.\\n\\n\"Of course! But need we stand here? Let us move on. We hold curious\\nconversations, do we not? Indeed, to think of all the things which I\\nnow say to you! Yet I still fear you a little, even though I trust you\\nas being, at heart, a good man.\"\\n\\n\"I am far from good; and you only call me so because I have lost all\\nsignificance in your eyes. Ill boots it to weave chaplets for the head\\nof a corpse.\"\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch, we cannot always command ourselves,\" came the sound\\nof Anna Sergievna\\'s next words; but the next moment the wind soughed,\\nthe leaves rustled, and the rest of what she was saying was carried\\naway into the distance. Nothing beyond it save (after a pause) \"You are\\nfree, are you not?\" on the part of Bazarov could be distinguished.\\nThen the sound of their footsteps died away, and once more complete\\nsilence reigned.\\n\\nTurning to Katia, Arkady saw that she was sitting as before, but with\\nher head more bent.\\n\\n\"Katerina Sergievna,\" he said tremulously, and with his hands clasped,\\n\"I shall love you always, and beyond recall; nor shall I ever love\\nanother woman. This is what I have been trying to say to you this\\nmorning, in the hope that I might ascertain your views, and then beg\\nfor your hand. I am not a rich man, but I would make any sacrifice for\\nyour sake. Come, then! Will you answer me? Will you trust me? Surely\\nyou do not think that I am speaking out of frivolity? Recall the past\\nfew days: may you not rest assured now that my remaining self (you know\\nwhat I mean) is gone for ever? Come, look at me--look at me and speak\\nbut a word, a single word. I love you, I love you! Do not refuse to\\nbelieve that I mean what I say.\"\\n\\nGravely, yet with a radiant look in her eyes, Katia raised her head,\\nand, after a moment\\'s thought, said with the trace of a smile: \"_Yes._\"\\n\\nArkady leapt up.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes\\'? You have said \\'Yes,\\' Katia! But what do mean by that word? Do\\nyou mean that you believe in my love, or do you mean that----? No, no;\\nI dare not finish the sentence.\"\\n\\nKatia repeated only the word \"Yes,\" but this time she left no room for\\nmisunderstanding. Arkady seized her large, but not unshapely, hands in\\nhis, and, panting with rapture, strained her to his breast. He could\\nscarcely stand upon his feet--he could only keep repeating again and\\nagain: \"Katia! Katia!\" Meanwhile she shed a few innocent tears at which\\nshe smiled as they fell. The man who has not seen such tears in the\\neyes of his beloved does not know the height of happiness to which,\\nwith mingled joy and gratitude and modesty, a woman can attain.\\n\\nNext morning Anna Sergievna sent for Bazarov to her boudoir; and when\\nhe arrived she, with a forced smile, handed him a folded sheet of\\nnotepaper. That sheet represented a letter from Arkady, a letter in\\nwhich he begged for her sister\\'s hand.\\n\\nBazarov skimmed the epistle--then scarcely could forbear venting the\\nrancour which blazed for a moment in his breast.\\n\\n\"It is as I said, you see,\" he commented. \"Only yesterday you were\\ntelling me that his feeling for Katerina Sergievna was that of a\\nbrother for a sister! And what are you going to do?\"\\n\\n\"What would you advise me to do?\" she said, still smiling.\\n\\n\"I presume\"--he also was smiling, although he was feeling as wholly out\\nof spirits, as little inclined towards gaiety, as she was--\"I presume\\nthat we have no choice but to bestow our blessing upon the young\\ncouple. In every respect it would be a good match, for his father has\\na nice little property, Arkady is the only son, and the father is too\\neasy-going to be likely to raise any difficulty.\"\\n\\nMadame Odintsov rose and paced the room for a moment or two--her face\\nalternately flushing and turning pale.\\n\\n\"So that is what you think?\" she said. \"Well, I too see no impediment.\\nIndeed, the affair rejoices me both for Katia\\'s sake and for--yes, for\\nhis. But first I must await his father\\'s consent; and for that purpose\\nI will send Arkady himself to interview Nikolai Petrovitch. So I was\\nright yesterday, was I not? I was right when I said that you and I are\\nbecome elderly? How did I fail to foresee this? I am indeed surprised\\nat it!\"\\n\\nAgain she smiled, but, in the very act of smiting, turned away.\\n\\n\"Our young folk are indeed cunning,\" remarked Bazarov. After a pause he\\nadded:\\n\\n\"Good-bye now. I hope that the affair may develop Well. From a distance\\nI, too, shall rejoice.\"\\n\\nShe turned and faced him.\\n\\n\"Need you really go?\" she asked. \"Why not stay a little longer? Pray\\nstay, for I find talking to you a stimulant--it is like walking on the\\nedge of a precipice: at first one is afraid, then one gathers courage.\\nDo not go.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for the proposal, as also for your flattering estimate of\\nmy conversational powers,\" said Bazarov. \"Nevertheless, I have tarried\\noverlong in a sphere which is alien to my personality. Only for a while\\ncan flying fish support themselves in the air. Then they relapse into\\ntheir natural element. Allow me to flop back into mine.\"\\n\\nYet a bitter laugh was twisting his pale features. She saw it, and felt\\nsorry for him.\\n\\n\"The man still loves me,\" was her thought, and she extended a\\nsympathetic hand.\\n\\nHe understood her, however.\\n\\n\"No, no!\" he exclaimed as he withdrew a step or two. \"Though poor, I\\nhave never yet accepted aims. Good-bye, and may your lot always be\\nhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Yet we shall meet again,\" she replied with an involuntary gesture. \"Of\\nthat I am certain.\"\\n\\n\"Anything may occur in this world,\" he remarked--then bowed and was\\ngone.\\n\\nThat afternoon he said to Arkady as he knelt down to pack his trunk:\\n\\n\"I hear that you are going to make a nest for yourself? And why should\\nyou not? It is an excellent course to take. But for you to dissemble\\nis useless, and I had scarcely expected that you would do so. Has the\\npreoccupation of it all deprived you of your tongue?\"\\n\\n\"When I left you at Marino I had no thought of this,\" said Arkady. \"You\\nare the dissembler, though, are you not? For when you say \\'It is an\\nexcellent course to take,\\' you dissemble, as well as waste your time,\\nseeing that I am well aware of your views on marriage.\"\\n\\n\"Merely my way of expressing myself. You see what I am doing at this\\nmoment. In my trunk is a vacant space. I am packing it with straw.\\nAnd the same with life\\'s trunk. To avoid leaving empty spaces therein\\nwe pad the interstices. You need not be offended. You cannot fail\\nto remember what I really think of Katerina Sergievna. While some\\nmaidens earn cheap reputations by merely smiling at right moments, your\\n_inamorata_ can show more--indeed, so much more that soon you will be\\n(and very properly) under her thumb.\"\\n\\nSlapping down the lid of the trunk, Bazarov rose from the floor.\\n\\n\"Now, farewell,\" he said. \"No, I will not deceive you: we are parting\\nfor ever, and you know it. In my opinion you have acted wisely,\\nfor you were not meant to live the hard, bitter, reckless life of\\nNihilism--you lack at once the necessary coolness and the necessary\\nvenom. But this is not to say that in you there is not a due measure of\\nyouthful spirit. What I mean is that that asset alone is not sufficient\\nfor the work. The _dvorianin_ is powerless to progress beyond either\\nwell-bred effervescence or well-bred humility: and both sentiments\\nare futile. For example, you have not yet been blooded, yet already\\nyou think yourself a man: whereas the two chief conditions of our\\nexistence are battle and bloodshed. Yes, the dust from our heels hurts\\nyour eyes, and the grime on our bodies makes you feel dirty. In other\\nwords, although you derive a certain gratification from indulging in\\nself-criticism, and think no small beer of yourself, you have failed\\nto grow to our stature. To us such things are vanities. Tools\\' of an\\naltogether different kind are what we need for the task. Consequently\\nI repeat that, though a fine young fellow enough, you are also just a\\nlittle-minded, so-called \\'liberal-minded\\' _baritch_[1]--what my father\\ncalls a \\'product of evolution.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Evgenii,\" was Arkady\\'s sad reply, \"we are parting for ever, yet this\\nis all that you have to say to me!\"\\n\\nBazarov scratched his head.\\n\\n\"Something else I could say, Arkady,\" he replied. \"But I will not say\\nthat something--it would savour too much of Romanticism. Get married\\nas soon as you can, line your nest, and beget plenty of offspring. Nor\\nwill those offspring be altogether fools, seeing that they will be born\\nin due season, and not when you and I were.... My horses are ready and\\nI must depart. Of the rest of the household I have taken leave already.\\nShall we embrace once more, eh?\"\\n\\nThe tears gushed in torrents from Arkady\\'s eyes as he flung himself\\nupon his old friend and mentor.\\n\\n\"Ah, youth, youth!\" commented Bazarov. \"See what comes of being young!\\nBut before long, I know, Katerina Sergievna will have set things right.\\nYes, she will console you.\"\\n\\nWith a last good-bye he mounted the travelling cart, and, in the act of\\ndoing so, pointed to a pair of jackdaws which were sitting perched upon\\nthe stable roof.\\n\\n\"See!\" he cried. \"_There\\'s_ an instructive lesson for you!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" queried Arkady.\\n\\n\"What?\" was Bazarov\\'s ejaculation. \"Are you so ignorant of, or so\\nforgetful of, natural history as not to know that the jackdaw is the\\nmost respected of family birds? Mark the good example before you.\\nFarewell, señor!\"\\n\\nAnd with a clatter the cart started on its way.\\n\\nNor was Bazarov mistaken, for, even before nightfall, Arkady, deep\\nin conversation with Katia, had completely forgotten his vanished\\ninstructor. Moreover, already the young fellow was beginning to play\\nsecond fiddle to his _fiancée_: which circumstance the girl, on\\nrealising, in no way felt surprised at. So it was arranged that on the\\nfollowing day he should depart for Marino to interview his father;\\nand in the meanwhile, Anna Sergievna, having no desire to hamper the\\nyoung couple, merely observed such a show of propriety as involved\\nher not leaving them together for long, but at the same time keeping\\nat a distance the Princess, who, since the tidings of the impending\\nunion, had been in a state of lachrymose rancour. For herself, Anna\\nSergievna had at first feared that the spectacle of the young people\\'s\\nhappiness would prove too much for her; but now the contrary proved to\\nbe the case, and she not only failed to feel hurt at the spectacle,\\nbut even found that it interested her and eventually softened her--a\\nconsummation which brought both relief and regret.\\n\\n\"Bazarov was right,\" she reflected. \"It was mere curiosity, mere love\\nof ease, mere egoism, mere----\"\\n\\n\"Children, is love an empirical sentiment?\" once she asked of Arkady\\nand Katia: but neither of the pair understood her meaning. Moreover,\\nthey were fighting a little shy of her, since they could not altogether\\nforget the conversation which they had involuntarily overheard; but in\\ntime Anna Sergievna succeeded in overcoming also this timidity, and\\nfound the task the more easy to perform in that she had succeeded also\\nin overcoming her disappointment.\\n\\n\\n[1] A small squire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\n\\nThe old Bazarovs\\' delight at their son\\'s return was the greater in\\nthat the event was so unexpected. To such an extent did Anna Vlasievna\\nfuss and flounce about the house that Vasili Ivanitch likened her to a\\nhen partridge (no doubt the short tail of her blouse _did_ impart to\\nher rather a bird-like aspect); while, as regards Vasili himself, he\\ngrunted, and sucked the amber mouthpiece of his pipe, and, grasping the\\nshank, inverted the bowl as though to make sure that it was secure,\\nand, finally, parted his capacious lips, and gave vent to a noiseless\\nchuckle.\\n\\n\"I am going to spend with you six whole weeks,\" said Bazarov. \"But I\\ndesire to work, and therefore must not be disturbed.\"\\n\\n\"Before we will disturb you, you shall forget what my face looks like,\"\\nreplied Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\\nAnd he kept his word; for, after allotting his son the study, he not\\nonly remained completely out of sight, but even prevented his wife from\\nmanifesting the least sign of tenderness.\\n\\n\"When Evgenii last visited us,\" he said to her, \"you and I proved a\\nlittle wearisome; so this time we must be more discreet.\"\\n\\nAnna Vlasievna agreed, much as she lost by the arrangement, seeing that\\nnow she beheld her son only at meal times, and feared, even then, to\\nspeak to him.\\n\\n\"Eniushenka,\" she would begin--then, before he had had time to raise\\nhis eyes, pluck nervously at the strings of her cap, and whisper: \"Oh\\nno; it was nothing,\" and address herself, instead, to Vasili Ivanitch;\\nsaying, for instance (with cheek on hand as usual): \"My dear, which\\nwould our darling Eniusha prefer for dinner--cabbage soup or beef with\\nhorse-radish?\" And when Vasili Ivanitch would reply: \"Why should you\\nnot ask him yourself?\" she would exclaim: \"Oh no, for that might vex\\nhim.\"\\n\\nBut eventually Bazarov ceased to closet himself, in that there came an\\nabatement of the work fever, and to it succeeded fits of depression,\\n_ennui_, and an inordinate restlessness. In his every movement there\\nbegan to loom a strange discontent, from his gait there disappeared\\nits old firm, active self-confidence, and, ceasing to indulge in\\nsolitary rambles, he took to cultivating society, to attending tea in\\nthe drawing-room, to pacing the kitchen garden, and to joining Vasili\\nIvanitch in a silent smoking of pipes. Nay, on one occasion he even\\npaid Father Alexis a visit!\\n\\nAt first the new order of things rejoiced Vasili Ivanitch\\'s heart: but\\nthat joy proved short-lived.\\n\\n\"Though I could not say why, Eniusha makes me anxious,\" he confided to\\nhis spouse. \"Not that he is discontented or ill-tempered--such things\\nwould not have mattered: rather, it is that he is sad and brooding,\\nand never opens his lips. Would that he would curse you and me, for\\ninstance! Also, he is thinner; nor do I like the colour of his face.\"\\n\\n\"O God!\" whispered the old woman. \"Yet I may not even put my arms\\naround his neck!\"\\n\\nFrom that time onwards Vasili Ivanitch began to make cautious attempts\\nto question Bazarov concerning his work, his health, and his friend\\nArkady; but always Bazarov returned reluctant, indifferent replies, and\\nonce, when his father was for introducing the foregoing topics, said\\nirritably:\\n\\n\"Why are you for ever tiptoeing around me? Your present manner is even\\nworse than your former one.\"\\n\\n\"There, there--I did not mean anything,\" was poor Vasili Ivanitch\\'s\\nreply.\\n\\nPolitical allusions proved equally fruitless. For instance, when Vasili\\nIvanitch was seeking to engage his son\\'s interest on the score of the\\nimpending emancipation of the serfs and progress in general, the other\\nmuttered carelessly:\\n\\n\"Yesterday, when passing through the courtyard, I heard some peasant\\nlads singing, not one of the good old songs, but I The age of truth is\\ncoming in, when hearts shall glow with love.\\' There\\'s progress for you!\"\\n\\nOccasionally Bazarov would repair to the village, and, in his usual\\nbantering fashion, enter into conversation with some peasant.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he said to a _muzhik_, \"pray expound to me your views on life.\\nFor they tell me that in you lie the whole strength and the whole\\nfuture of Russia--that you are going to begin a new epoch in our\\nhistory, and to give us both a real language and new laws.\"\\n\\nThe peasant made no reply at the moment. Then he said:\\n\\n\"We might do all that if first we had a new chapel here.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me something, though, about the world in general,\" Bazarov\\ninterrupted. \"The world stands on three fishes, does it not?\"\\n\\n\"It does that, _batiushka_,\" the peasant replied with the quiet,\\ngood-humoured sweetness of the patriarchal age. \"But above it stands\\nthe will of the masters. The _baré_ are our fathers, and the harder the\\n_barin_ drives, the better for the _muzhik_.\"\\n\\nShrugging his shoulders contemptuously at this statement, Bazarov\\nturned away, while the peasant slunk off homewards.\\n\\n\"What did he say?\" asked a sullen-looking, middle-aged peasant who\\nhad been standing at the door of his hut during the course of the\\nforegoing colloquy. \"Was he talking of arrears of taxes?\"\\n\\n\"Of arrears of taxes!\" retorted the first peasant, his tone now\\ncontaining not a trace of its late patriarchal sweetness, but, rather,\\na note of purely dry contempt. \"He was chattering just for chattering\\'s\\nsake--he likes to hear his own tongue wag. Do not all of us know what a\\n_barin_ and the likes of him are good for?\"\\n\\n\"Aye,\" agreed the second peasant; whereafter, with much nodding of\\ncaps and gesticulating of fists, they fell to discussing their own\\naffairs and requirements. So alas for Bazarov\\'s scornful shrug of the\\nshoulders! And alas for that knowledge of the way in which the peasant\\nshould be talked to whereof the young Nihilist had made such boast when\\ndisputing with Paul Petrovitch! In fact, never had it dawned upon the\\nmind of the self-confident Bazarov that, in the eyes of the _muzhik_,\\nhe was no better than a pease-pudding.\\n\\nHowever, he succeeded in discovering for himself an occupation. This\\nwas when, in bandaging a peasant\\'s leg, Vasili Ivanitch\\'s hands shook\\na little through senility, and his son hastened to his assistance: and\\nfrom that time forth Bazarov acted as Vasili Ivanitch\\'s partner, even\\nthough he maintained unabated his ridicule both of the remedies which\\nhe himself advised and of the father who hastened to put them into\\npractice. Yet in no way did his son\\'s raillery annoy Vasili Ivanitch:\\nrather, it heartened the old man. Smoking his pipe, and drawing his\\ndirty overall in to his waist with both thumbs, he would listen\\ndelightedly to the scoffer, and chuckle, and show his blackened teeth\\nthe more in proportion as the sallies contained a greater measure of\\nvenom. Nay, stupid or simply senseless as many of these witticisms\\nwere, he would frequently catch them up, and repeat them. To take one\\ninstance, he, for several days in succession, kept assuring every one\\nin the village and in the town that \"we call this the nine o\\'clock\\noffice\"--the sole basis being the fact that once, on learning of his\\n(Vasili Ivanitch\\'s) habit of attending Matins, Bazarov had made use of\\nthe phrase in question.\\n\\n\"Thank God, Evgenii has ceased to mope,\" he confided in a whisper to\\nhis wife. \"In fact, you should have heard him rating me to-day!\"\\n\\nAlso, the thought that he had such an assistant in his labours filled\\nthe old man with pride.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he would say as he handed some peasant woman in a man\\'s\\njacket a phial of medicinal water or a pot of cold cream, \"you ought\\ndaily to thank God that my son happens to be staying with me, since\\notherwise you could not possibly have been treated according to the\\nlatest and most scientific methods. Do you understand? I say that even\\nNapoleon, the Emperor of the French, has not at his disposal a better\\nphysician than my son.\"\\n\\nAnd the peasant woman (who had come, it may be, to complain of \"a\\nlifting with the gripes\"--an expression which probably she herself\\ncould not have explained) would bow, then proffer the three or four\\neggs which would be tied up in a corner of her neckcloth.\\n\\nAlso, when Bazarov extracted a tooth from the jaw of a travelling\\npedlar, Vasili Ivanitch could not allow even the very ordinary\\ncharacter of the tooth to prevent him from preserving it as a rarity,\\nand showing it to Father Alexis.\\n\\n\"See what a fang!\" he said. \"And to think of the strength which Evgenii\\nmust possess! He lifted the pedlar clean from the ground! It was like\\nuprooting an oak tree!\"\\n\\n\"Splendid!\" was Father Alexis\\' comment--he knew not what else to say,\\nnor, for that matter, how else to get rid of the enthusiastic veteran.\\n\\nLastly, there was an occasion when a peasant from a neighbouring\\nvillage brought his brother to be treated. Suffering from typhus,\\nthe patient was lying face downwards on the straw in the cart, and\\nhad reached the last stage, since already his body was covered with\\nspots of a hectic nature, and he had long lost consciousness. To an\\nexpression of regret that resort had not sooner been had to medical\\naid, Vasili Ivanitch could add no more than an intimation that no\\nhope was left: nor was he wrong, seeing that even before the peasant\\nsucceeded in conveying his brother back to the village, the sick man\\nhad breathed his last.\\n\\nThree days later Bazarov entered his father\\'s room with an inquiry for\\nsome hell-stone.\\n\\n\"I have some,\" said Vasili Ivanitch; \"but what do you want it for?\"\\n\\n\"For the cauterisation of a wound.\"\\n\\n\"A wound on whom?\"\\n\\n\"A wound on myself.\"\\n\\n\"On yourself? Let me see the place. Where is it?\"\\n\\n\"There--on that finger. To-day I went to the village whence they\\nbrought the typhus patient the other day; and though they tried to\\nconceal the body, I succeeded in discovering it. Not for a long time\\nhad I had a chance of doing that sort of work.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"And the sequel was that I cut myself, and, on repairing to the\\ndistrict physician, found that he did not possess what I wanted.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch went white to the lips. Hurrying, without a word, into\\nhis study, he returned thence with some hell-stone. Bazarov was for\\ncarrying it away forthwith.\\n\\n\"No, no!\" cried Vasili Ivanitch. \"For God\\'s sake allow me to see to\\nthis in person.\"\\n\\nBazarov smiled.\\n\\n\"You are indeed a keen practitioner,\" he commented.\\n\\n\"Do not jest, I beg of you. Show me the finger. No, it is not a large\\nwound. Am I hurting it at all?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least. Have no fear. You can press it harder still if you\\nlike.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch paused.\\n\\n\"Do you not think,\" he said, \"that it would be better to cauterise the\\nfinger with an iron?\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not. Moreover, that ought, in any case, to have been done\\nsooner; whereas by now even the hell-stone is unlikely to prove\\neffectual, seeing that, as you know, once absorbed into the system, the\\ngerm renders all remedies too late.\"\\n\\n\"How \\'too late\\'?\" gasped Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\\n\"What I say. Four hours have elapsed since the injury.\"\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch gave the wound a further cauterisation. \"So the\\ndistrict physician had no hell-stone?\" he queried.\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"God in heaven! To think of that man calling himself a doctor, yet\\nbeing without such an indispensable remedy!\"\\n\\n\"You should have seen his lancets!\" remarked Bazarov. Then he left the\\nroom.\\n\\nThroughout that evening and the next few days Vasili Ivanitch kept\\nmaking every possible excuse to enter his son\\'s room; and though he\\nnever actually referred to the wound--he even strove to confine his\\nconversation to purely extraneous subjects--his observation of his\\nson remained so persistent, his solicitude so marked, that at length\\nBazarov, losing patience, bade him begone. Of course Vasili Ivanitch\\npromised not to repeat the intrusion; and as a matter of fact he\\nkept this promise the more religiously in that Arina Vlasievna (who\\nhad had the matter carefully concealed from her) was beginning to\\nscent something in the wind, and to press for reasons why, during\\nthe previous night, her husband had never once closed his eyes.\\nAccordingly, for the next two days Vasili Ivanitch faithfully observed\\nthe undertaking he had given; and that although the covert observation\\nof his son\\'s looks which he maintained showed them to be growing by\\nno means to his liking: but on the third day, during dinner, Vasili\\nIvanitch could bear it no more, for Bazarov was sitting with his eyes\\nlowered and his plate empty.\\n\\n\"You are eating nothing, Evgenii?\" he said with his face composed to\\nexpress absolute indifference. \"In my opinion, the dinner is well\\ncooked.\"\\n\\n\"The only reason why I am eating nothing,\" replied Bazarov, \"is that I\\nam not hungry.\"\\n\\n\"You have no appetite?\" the old man queried timidly. \"Also, is--is your\\nhead aching at all?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Why should it not ache?\"\\n\\nArina Vlasievna began to prick up her ears.\\n\\n\"Do not be angry, Evgenii,\" Vasili Ivanitch continued, \"b-but might I\\nfeel your pulse and examine you?\"\\n\\nBazarov looked at him.\\n\\n\"You need not feel my pulse,\" he said. \"Without that, I can tell that I\\nhave a touch of fever.\"\\n\\n\"You feel shivery, eh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I think I will go and lie down. Pray make me a little lime-juice\\ntea, for I seem to have caught a chill.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Arina Vlasievna put in, \"I heard you coughing last night.\"\\n\\n\"But it is only a chill,\" added Bazarov, and left the room.\\n\\nSo Arina Vlasievna set to work to make the lime-juice tea, and Vasili\\nIvanitch went into an adjoining room and tore his hair.\\n\\nBazarov did not get up again that day, but passed the night in a state\\nof heavy coma. At one o\\'clock he opened his eyes with an effort, and,\\non seeing his father\\'s pale face in the lamp-light, bade him depart.\\nAt once the other excused himself for the intrusion, but nevertheless\\nreturned on tiptoe, and, concealing himself behind the open doors of\\na cupboard, remained there to watch his son. Nor did Arina Vlasievna\\ngo to bed, but at intervals set the study door ajar, in order that she\\nmight \"see how our Eniusha was sleeping\" and look at Vasili Ivanitch:\\nfor though nothing of the latter was to be discerned except a bowed,\\nmotionless back, even that much afforded her a little comfort.\\n\\nIn the morning Bazarov attempted to rise, but his head swam, and blood\\ngushed from his nose, so he desisted from the attempt. In silence\\nVasili Ivanitch tended him, and Arina Vlasievna came to ask him how he\\nfelt. He replied \"Better,\" then turned his face to the wall. Instantly\\nVasili Ivanitch fell to gesticulating violently at his wife with both\\nhands: which proceeding proved so far successful that, by dint of\\nbiting her lips, Arina Vlasievna contrived to force back the tears,\\nand leave the room. Of a sudden everything in the house had seemed to\\nturn dark. Everywhere faces looked drawn, and everywhere there was to\\nbe observed a curious stillness of which one cause, among others, was\\nthe fact that there had hastily been removed from the courtyard of the\\nvillage a vociferous cock which no reasoning had been able to convince\\nof the necessity of silence.\\n\\nSo Bazarov continued lying with his face to the wall. Once or\\ntwice Vasili Ivanitch essayed a tentative question or two, but the\\nattempt only wearied Bazarov, and the old man at length subsided\\ninto an armchair, and sat nervously twitching his fingers. Next,\\nVasili repaired to the garden for a few minutes, and looked, as he\\nstood there, like a statue which has been struck with immeasurable\\nastonishment (never at any time was the expression of surprise absent\\nfrom his features); whereafter he returned to his son\\'s room, in the\\nhope of evading questions on the part of his wife, but she took him by\\nthe hand, and grimly, almost threateningly asked: \"What is the matter\\nwith our Eniusha?\" and when Vasili strove to pull himself together, and\\nto force a smile, there issued, to his horror, not a smile at all, but\\na sort of irresponsible laugh.\\n\\nEarlier in the morning he had sent for a doctor to assist him;\\nwherefore he now considered that it would be well to advise his son of\\nthe fact, lest Bazarov should lose his temper on discovering the fact\\nin question for himself.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch explained the situation, and then Bazarov turned\\nhimself about on the sofa, gazed at his father for a moment or two, and\\nasked to be given something to drink. Vasili Ivanitch handed him some\\nwater, and seized the opportunity also to feel his son\\'s forehead. It\\nseemed to be on fire.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said Bazarov in a hoarse, dragging voice, \"I fear that my\\ncourse is run. The infection has caught me, and in a few days you will\\nbe laying me in my grave.\"\\n\\nSome one might have thrust Vasili Ivanitch violently backwards, so\\nsharply did he stagger.\\n\\n\"Evgenii,\" he gasped, \"why say that? God have you in his keeping! It is\\nmerely that you have caught a chill.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come!\" interrupted Bazarov, but in the same dragging tone as\\nbefore. \"It is useless to talk like that to a doctor. All the signs of\\ninfection are present. That you know for yourself.\"\\n\\n\"But--but where are the signs of--of infection?\"\\n\\n\"Look at these. What do they mean?\"\\n\\nAnd Bazarov pulled up the sleeve of his shirt. What he showed his\\nfather was a number of red, angry-looking patches that were coming into\\nview.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch started and turned cold with fear. At length he\\ncontrived to stammer out:\\n\\n\"Yet--even supposing that, that there should be anything in the nature\\nof infection----\"\\n\\n\"Of pyæmia, you mean,\" the son prompted.\\n\\n\"Anything in the nature of epidemic infec----\"\\n\\n\"Of pyæmia, I repeat,\" grimly, insistently corrected Bazarov. \"Have you\\nforgotten your textbooks?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--well, have it your own way. But we will cure you, all the same.\"\\n\\n\"Fiddlesticks! But, apart from that question, I had scarcely looked to\\ndie so soon. To be frank, I think it hard upon me. And now you and my\\nmother must fall back upon the fund of religious strength which lies\\nwithin you. The hour to put it to the test has arrived.\" He drank some\\nmore water. \"One particular request I desire to make while my brain is\\nyet clear, for, by to-morrow, or the day after, it will, as you know,\\nhave failed, and even now I am not sure whether I am expressing myself\\nsensibly, seeing that, as I was lying here just now, I seemed to see\\na pack of red dogs leaping around me, and yourself making a point at\\nme as a dog does at a partridge. Yes, it was like being drunk. Can you\\nunderstand what I say?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, Evgenii; you are talking quite sensibly.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. Now, I believe that you have sent for a doctor; and if the\\nfact will give you any comfort, I too shall be pleased. But also I beg\\nthat you will send word to, to----\"\\n\\n\"To Arkady Nikolaievitch?\" the old man suggested.\\n\\n\"To whom? To Arkady Nikolaievitch?\" re-echoed Bazarov bewilderedly.\\n\"Oh, you mean that young cockerel of ours? No, no--do not disturb him,\\nfor he has just joined the company of the jackdaws. You need not be\\nsurprised at these words--they do not mean that delirium is setting in;\\nthey are merely a metaphor. Well, it is to Madame Odintsov, the lady\\nlandowner of this neighbourhood, that I desire a messenger to be sent.\\nI suppose you have heard of her?\" (Vasili Ivanitch nodded assent.)\\n\"All that the messenger need say is that Evgenii Vasilitch sends his\\ncompliments, and is dying. Will you do this?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will, Evgenii! But why think that you are going to die?\\nCome, come! Were such a thing to happen, where would be the justice of\\nthe world?\"\\n\\n\"I could not say. I only know that I desire the messenger to be sent.\"\\n\\n\"He shall start at once, and I myself will write the letter.\"\\n\\n\"No, no: that will not be necessary. Merely let the messenger deliver\\nmy greeting. That, and nothing more. Now I will return to my red dogs.\\nHow curious it is that, though I strive to concentrate my thoughts upon\\ndeath, there results from them nothing--I see before me only a great\\nblur!\"\\n\\nAnd he turned his face wearily to the wall, while Vasili Ivanitch left\\nthe room, ascended to the bedroom above, and fell upon his knees before\\nthe sacred _ikons_.\\n\\n\"Pray, Arina, pray!\" he moaned. \"Our son is dying!\"\\n\\nOn the doctor arriving, the latter proved to be the district physician\\nwho had failed to produce hell-stone when required. After an\\nexamination of the patient he prescribed a watching course, and also\\nadded a few words as to a possible recovery.\\n\\n\"Have you ever known people in my condition _not_ set out for the\\nElysian Fields?\" asked Bazarov sharply as he caught hold of the leg\\nof a table which stood beside his sofa, and shook it until the table\\nactually altered its position. \"See my strength!\" he continued. \"All\\nof it is still there, yet I must go hence! To think that, whereas an\\nold man has lost touch with life, I should----! Ah, however much you\\nmay deny death, it never will deny _you_.... I hear some one weeping.\\nWho is it?\" There was a pause. \"Is it my mother? Poor soul! No one will\\nbe left for her to stuff with her marvellous _borstchi_.[1] And you,\\nVasili Ivanitch--are you too whimpering? Come, come! If Christianity\\ncannot help you, try to become a Stoic philosopher. You have often\\nenough boasted of being one.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, a fine philosopher I, to be sure!\" sobbed poor old Vasili with\\nthe tears hopping down his cheeks.\\n\\nThereafter Bazarov grew hourly worse, for the disease was taking the\\nrapid course inevitable under the circumstances. Yet his powers of\\nmemory were unimpaired, and he understood everything that was said to\\nhim, for as yet he was making a brave fight to retain his faculties.\\n\\n\"No, I must not let my senses fail,\" he kept whispering to himself as\\nhe clenched his fists. \"But oh, the folly of it all!\" And then he would\\nrepeat to himself, over and over again, some such formula as \"Eight and\\nten--what do they make?\"\\n\\nMeanwhile Vasili Ivanitch wandered about in a state bordering upon\\ndistraction--proposing first one remedy, and then another, and\\nconstantly covering up his son\\'s feet.\\n\\n\"Suppose we wrap him in an ice-sheet?\" he suggested once in a tone of\\nagony. \"How, too, about an emetic, or a mustard plaster on his stomach,\\nor a little bloodletting?\"\\n\\nBut to each and all of these remedies the doctor (whom Vasili Ivanitch\\nhad begged to remain in the house) demurred. Likewise the doctor drank\\nthe patient\\'s lemonade, and then requested to be given a pipe and\\n\"something warm and strengthening\"--to wit, a glassful of _vodka_.\\nMeanwhile Arina Vlasievna sat on a chair by the door, and only at\\nintervals retired to pray. It seemed that a few days earlier she had\\nlet fall, and broken, a toilet mirror, and that all her life long\\nshe had looked upon such an occurrence as an evil omen. With her, in\\nsilence, sat Anfisushka; while, as for Timotheitch, he had departed\\nwith the message to Madame Odintsov.\\n\\nThat night Bazarov did not improve, for he was racked with high fever;\\nbut as morning approached, the fever grew a little easier, and after\\nhe had asked Arina Vlasievna to perform his toilet, and had kissed her\\nhand, he managed to swallow a little tea: which circumstance caused\\nVasili Ivanitch to pluck up courage, and to exclaim:\\n\\n\"Thank God, the crisis has both come and gone!\"\\n\\n\"Do not be too sure of that,\" rejoined Bazarov. \"For what does the\\nterm \\'crisis\\' signify? Some one once invented it, shouted \\'Crisis!\\'\\nand congratulated himself ever after. Extraordinary how the human\\nrace continues to attach credence to mere words! For example, tell a\\nman that he is a fool, yet refrain from assaulting him, and he will\\nbe downcast; but tell him that he is a man of wisdom, yet give him no\\nmoney, and he will be overjoyed.\"\\n\\nSo reminiscent of Bazarov\\'s former sallies was this little speech that\\nVasili Ivanitch\\'s heart fairly overflowed.\\n\\n\"Bravo!\" he cried, clapping his hands in dumb show. \"Well said!\"\\n\\nBazarov smiled a sad smile.\\n\\n\"Then you think,\" said he, \"that the \\'crisis\\' is either approaching or\\nretiring?\"\\n\\n\"I know that you are better. That I can see for myself. And the fact\\nrejoices me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is not always a bad thing to rejoice. But have you sent word\\nto, to--to _her_? You know whom I mean?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I have, Evgenii.\"\\n\\nThe improvement did not long continue, for to it there succeeded\\nattacks of pain. Vasili Ivanitch sat by the bed: and as he did so it\\nseemed as though something in particular were worrying the old man.\\nSeveral times he tried to speak, and each time he failed. But at length\\nhe contrived to gasp out:\\n\\n\"Evgenii! Son! My dearest son! My own beloved son!\"\\n\\nEven Bazarov could not remain wholly indifferent to such an unwonted\\nappeal. Turning his head a little, and making an evident effort to\\nshake off the unconsciousness that was weighing him down, he murmured:\\n\\n\"What is it, my father?\"\\n\\n\"This, Evgenii.\" And all of a sudden the old man fell upon his knees\\nbeside the bed. \"Evgenii, you are better now, and with God\\'s help will\\nrecover; but do, in any case, seize this hour to comfort me and your\\nmother by fulfilling all the duties of a Christian. Yes, though to say\\nthis is painful for me, how much more terribly would it hurt me if--if\\nthis chance were to pass for ever, Evgenii! Think, oh think of what----\"\\n\\nThe old man could say no more, while over the son\\'s face and closed\\neyes there passed a curious expression. A pause followed. Then Bazarov\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"To comfort you, I will not altogether refuse your request; but, since\\nyou yourself have said that I am better, surely there can be no need\\nfor hurry?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you _are_ better, Evgenii--you _are_ better; but who can say what\\nmay lie in the dispensation of God? Whereas, once this duty shall have\\nbeen fulfilled----\"\\n\\n\"Yet I will wait a little,\" interrupted Bazarov. \"This much, however, I\\nwill concede: that, should you prove to be wrong in your surmise as to\\nmy recovery, I will allow the Last Sacrament to be administered.\"\\n\\n\"And, Evgenii, I beg of you to----\"\\n\\n\"I will wait a little, I repeat. And now let me go to sleep. Do not\\ndisturb me.\"\\n\\nAnd he replaced his head in its former position, while the old man rose\\nfrom his knees, reseated himself in the chair, rested his chin upon his\\nhands, and fell to biting his fingers.\\n\\nPresently Vasili\\'s ear caught the rumble of a light carriage--the sound\\nwhich is always so distinguishable in a quiet country spot. Nearer and\\nnearer came the sound of the wheels; nearer and nearer came the hard\\nbreathing of horses. Springing from his chair, he rushed to the window.\\nInto the courtyard of the mansion there was turning a two-seated,\\nfour-horsed buggy! Without stopping to think what this could mean, he\\ndarted forward to the front door, where, transported with joy, he was\\njust in time to see a liveried footman open the door of the vehicle,\\nand assist thence a lady in a black cloak, with a veil of the same hue.\\n\\n\"I am Madame Odintsov,\" she said. \"Is Evgenii Vasilitch still alive? I\\npresume you are his father? I have brought with me a doctor.\"\\n\\nEven as she spoke the doctor in question--a German-looking little\\nindividual in spectacles--descended in a slow and dignified manner from\\nthe buggy.\\n\\n\"O angel of mercy!\" cried Vasili Ivanitch as, seizing her hand, he\\npressed it convulsively to his lips. \"Yes, our Evgenii is still alive!\\nAnd now he will be saved! Wife! Wife! There is an angel come to us from\\nHeaven!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" responded the old woman with a gasp as she came running out\\nof the hall. So lost in bewilderment was she that, falling at Anna\\nSergievna\\'s feet, she actually began madly to kiss the hem of the\\nvisitor\\'s cloak.\\n\\n\"Come, come!\" Madame exclaimed. \"What does all this mean?\"\\n\\nBut Arina Vlasievna was deaf to everything, and Vasili Ivanitch too\\ncould only continue repeating:\\n\\n\"There is an angel come to us from Heaven! There is an angel come to us\\nfrom Heaven! There is an angel come to us from Heaven!\"\\n\\n\"_Wo ist der Kranke_? (Where is the patient)?\" asked the doctor with a\\ntouch of impatience.\\n\\nThis restored Vasili Ivanitch to his senses.\\n\\n\"Come this way, come this way,\" he said. \"Yes, pray follow me,\\n_Werthester Herr Kollega_\" (titles based upon the strength of bygone\\nmemories).\\n\\nFor answer the German exclaimed \"Eh?\", and pulled a not very gracious\\nsmirk.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch led the way to the study.\\n\\n\"Here is the doctor brought by Madame Anna Sergievna Odintsov,\" he said\\nas he bent over his son.\\n\\n\"She herself too is here.\"\\n\\nBazarov opened his eyes with a start.\\n\\n\"What do you say?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"I say that Madame Anna Sergievna Odintsov is here, and that she has\\nbrought with her this good doctor.\"\\n\\nBazarov peered around.\\n\\n\"Where is Anna Sergievna?\" he murmured. \"Do you say that she is here?\\nThen I wish to see her.\"\\n\\n\"You shall see her, Evgenii; but first of all I must have a chat with\\nthis gentleman, and tell him the story of your illness: for Sidor\\nSidorovitch\" (that was the name of the district physician) \"has gone\\nhome, and a short consultation must be held.\"\\n\\nBazarov eyed the German.\\n\\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Hold your consultation as soon as you like.\\nOnly, do not speak in Latin, for I know the meaning of the words _Jam\\nmoritur.\"_\\n\\n\"_Der Herr scheint des Deutschen mächtig zu sein_,\" the newly-arrived\\ndisciple of Æsculapius remarked to Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\\n\"_Ich habe_----\" the old man began; then added: \"But perhaps we had\\nbetter speak in Russian, my dear sir?\"\\n\\nAnd the consultation followed.\\n\\nHalf an hour later Vasili Ivanitch conducted Anna Sergievna into the\\nstudy. As the doctor passed out he whispered to her that recovery was\\nhopeless.\\n\\nShe glanced at Bazarov, and halted as though petrified, so striking was\\nthe bloodshot, deathlike face, with the dim eyes turned so yearningly\\nin her direction. Nevertheless her feeling was one merely of chill,\\noppressive terror, while at the same moment there flashed through her\\nbrain the thought that, if she had loved him, no such feeling could now\\nhave been present.\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" he said with an effort. \"I had not expected this, and\\nyou have done a kind act in coming. So we meet once more, even as you\\nforetold!\"\\n\\n\"Has not Madame Anna Sergievna indeed been kind?\" put in Vasili\\nIvanitch.\\n\\n\"Father, pray leave us,\" said Bazarov. \"I know, Anna Sergievna, that\\nyou will excuse him. For at such a time as this----\" And he nodded\\ntowards his weak, prostrate form.\\n\\nVasili Ivanitch left the room.\\n\\n\"A second time I thank you,\" continued Bazarov. \"To have acted so is\\nworthy of the Tsars. For they say that even the Sovereign visits a\\ndeathbed when requested.\"\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch, I hope that----\"\\n\\n\"Let us speak plainly. My course is run. I am under the wheel, and\\nwe need not think of the future. Yet how curious it is that to each\\nindividual human being death, old though it is as an institution,\\ncomes as a novelty!... Nevertheless, it shall not make me quail: and\\nthen there will fall the curtain, and then--well, then they will write\\n_Fuit_.\" There followed a feeble gesture. \"But what did I want to\\nsay to you? That I have loved you? There was a time when the phrase\\n\\'I love\\' had for me no meaning; and now it will have less than ever,\\nseeing that love is a form, and that my particular embodiment of it is\\nfast lapsing towards dissolution. It Ah, how perfect you are! You stand\\nthere as beautiful as---\"\\n\\nThere passed over Anna Sergievna an involuntary shudder.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" he said. You need not be afraid. \"But will you not sit down?\\nSeat yourself near me, but not too near, for my malady is infectious.\"\\n\\nShe crossed the room with a rapid step, and seated herself beside the\\nsofa on which he was lying.\\n\\n\"O woman of kind heart!\" he whispered. \"And to think that you are\\nbeside me once more! To think that you, so pure and fresh and young,\\nare in this sorry room! Well, good-bye, and may you live long, and\\nenjoy your time while you may. Of all things in this world long life is\\nthe most desirable: yet you can see for yourself what an ugly spectacle\\nI, a half-crushed, but still wriggling, worm, am now become. There was\\na time when I used to say: \\'I will do many things in life, and refuse\\nto die before I have completed those tasks, for I am a giant\\': but now\\nI have indeed a giant\\'s task in hand--the task of dying as though death\\nwere nothing to me.... No matter. I am not going to put my tail between\\nmy legs.\"\\n\\nHe broke off, and groped for his tumbler. She handed it him without\\ndrawing off her glove. Her breath was coming in jerks.\\n\\n\"It will not be long before you will have forgotten me,\" he went on.\\n\"For a dead mortal is no companion for a living one. I daresay that my\\nfather will tell you what a man is being lost to Russia; but that is\\nall rubbish. Nevertheless, do not undeceive him, for he is old, old.\\nRather, comfort him as you would comfort a child, and also be kind to\\nmy mother. Two such mortals as them you will not find in all _your_\\ngreat world--no, not though you search for them with a candle by\\ndaylight.... Russia needs me, indeed! Evidently she does _not_ need me.\\nWhom, then, does she need? She needs shoemakers, tailors, butchers....\\nWhat does a butcher sell? He sells meat, does he not?... I think that I\\nam wandering--I seem to see before me a forest....\"\\n\\nHe pressed his hand to his forehead, and Anna Sergievna bent over him.\\n\\n\"Evgenii Vasilitch,\" she said, \"I am here.\"\\n\\nWith a combined movement he took her hand and raised himself a little.\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" he said with a sudden spasm of energy and a last flash\\nof his eyes. \"Good-bye.... I kissed you that time, did I not, when,\\nwhen----?... Ah, breathe now upon the expiring lamp, that it may go out\\nin peace.\"\\n\\nShe pressed her lips gently to his forehead.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" he murmured as he sank back upon the pillow. \"Now let there\\ncome--darkness.\"\\n\\nShe left the room quietly.\\n\\n\"Well?\" whispered Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\\n\"He has gone to sleep,\" she replied in a voice that was scarcely\\naudible.\\n\\nBut Bazarov was not fated to go to sleep. Rather, as night approached\\nhe sank into a state of coma, and, on the following day, expired.\\nFather Alexis performed over him the last rites of religion, and at\\nthe moment when Extreme Unction was being administered, and the holy\\noil touched his breast, one of the dying man\\'s eyelids raised itself,\\nand over the face there seemed to flit something like an expression\\nof distaste at the sight of the priest in his vestments, the smoking\\ncenser, and the candles before the _ikon._\\n\\nFinally, when Bazarov\\'s last breath had been drawn, and there had\\narisen in the house the sound of \"the general lamentation,\" something\\nakin to frenzy came upon Vasili Ivanitch.\\n\\n\"I declare that I protest!\" he cried with his face blazing and\\nquivering with fury, and his fist beating the air as in menace of some\\none. \"I declare that I protest, that I protest, that I protest!\"\\n\\nUpon that old Arina Vlasievna, suffused in tears, laid her arms around\\nhis neck, and the two sank forward upon the floor. Said Anfisushka\\nlater, when relating the story in the servants\\' quarters: \"There they\\nknelt together--side by side, their heads drooping like those of two\\nsheep at midday.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAh, but in time the heat of noontide passes, and to it there succeed\\nnightfall and dusk, with a return to the quiet fold where for the weary\\nand the heavy-laden there waits sleep, sweet sleep.\\n\\n\\n[1] Roast beef with horse-radish.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\n\\nSince that time six months have passed, and there has fallen upon the\\ncountry a \"white\" winter--a winter of clear, keen, motionless frosts,\\nof deep, crackling snow, of pink-rimed trees, of pale-emerald heavens,\\nof smoke-capped chimneys, of puffs of vapour from momentarily opened\\ndoors, of faces fresh and hard-bitten, of horses galloping headlong\\nto thaw their frozen limbs. It is now the close of a January day,\\nand the increasing chill of evening is nipping the still air in an\\never-tightening vice as the sun sinks downward into a sea of red.\\n\\nBut in the windows of Marino there are lights burning, and Prokofitch,\\nvested in a black tail-coat, a pair of white gloves, and a peculiar\\natmosphere of solemnity, is laying the table with seven covers. This\\nis because a week ago there were solemnised in the tiny church of\\nthe parish--solemnised quietly, almost without a witness--two sets\\nof nuptials: the nuptials of Arkady and Katia and those of Nikolai\\nPetrovitch and Thenichka. And to-day Nikolai Petrovitch is offering his\\nbrother a farewell dinner, for the reason that Paul is on the point of\\ndeparting for Moscow, whither Anna Sergievna has already removed after\\nbestowing upon the younger of the two couples a handsome dowry.\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock precisely the company gathers around the board.\\nMitia too is present with his _niania_ (in nurse\\'s cap), while Paul\\nPetrovitch is seated between Katia and Thenichka, and the bridegrooms\\nare ranged one on either side of their newly-wedded spouses. A change\\nhas taken place in our old acquaintances since last we saw them--they\\nhave improved, as regards the younger ones, both in appearance and in\\nsedateness of demeanour. Only Paul Petrovitch looks thinner; though\\nthe circumstance imparts, if anything, an added touch of refinement and\\n\"grand-seignorishness\" to his always expressive features. Thenichka,\\nin particular, is a different person from what she was. Clad in a\\nbrand-new silken gown, and wearing a broad velvet band over her hair\\nand a necklace around her throat, she holds herself with an immovable\\ndignity, yet also with an immovable deference towards her surroundings.\\nAnd meanwhile she smiles, as much as to say: \"Pardon me, but _I_ am not\\nresponsible for this\"; while the others respond with similar smiles,\\nas though they too would be glad to excuse themselves for their share\\nin the proceedings. Yet the fact that on every one present sits a\\ntouch of gravity and embarrassment becomes the company no less than\\ndo their other characteristics. Everywhere, too, there is to be seen\\nsuch an anxious solicitude for mutual wants that the company could seem\\nunanimously to be playing some simple-minded comedy; and though, of\\nthe guests, the quietest is Katia, it is plain, from her confidence of\\nbearing, that, as a daughter-in-law, she has found favour in the eyes\\nof Nikaiai Petrovitch.\\n\\nAt length the meal comes to an end, and Nikolai, rising and grasping a\\nwine-glass, addresses Paul Petrovitch:\\n\\n\"Dearest brother, you are about to leave us. Yes, you are about to\\nleave us. But not for long must you be absent, since I, for one, could\\nnever express to you how much I, how much I--that is to say, how much\\nwe But, to tell you the truth, I am not good at making a speech.\\nArkady, to you I depute the task.\"\\n\\n\"But I am not ready, Papa.\"\\n\\n\"Neither am I. However, Paul, I embrace you, and wish you every joy,\\nand beg of you to return to us soon.\"\\n\\nWhereupon Paul Petrovitch exchanges greetings all round (not excluding\\nlittle Mitia), and, in particular, kisses Thenichka\\'s hand (which she\\nhas not learnt to offer in the right way), drinks a twice-filled glass\\nto the company at large, and says with a profound sigh: \"May you all\\nbe happy, my friends! Farewell![1]\" And though the English terminal\\nflourish passes unnoticed, every one is touched with the benediction\\nwhich has preceded it.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I drink to the memory of Bazarov,\" whispers Katia to her\\nhusband as she clinks glasses with him: but though, in response, he\\nsqueezes her hand, he decides not to propose the toast in public.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAnd here, apparently, there ought to follow the word _Finis_; but since\\nsome of my readers may care to know how each of the characters in the\\nbook is faring at the present day, I will satisfy that curiosity.\\n\\nTo take Anna Sergievna first, she has married--not for love, nor yet\\nout of a sense of duty--a rising young statesman who is an intelligent\\nlegislator, a severely practical thinker, a man of strong will and\\neloquence, and a lover with a temperament as cold as ice. Nevertheless\\nthe pair reside on amicable terms, and may, in time, attain to\\nhappiness--nay, even to love.\\n\\nAs for the Princess, she is dead, and her memory perished with her.\\n\\nThe Kirsanovs, father and son, are settled at Marino, and appear to be\\nrighting their industrial affairs, in that Arkady has developed into a\\ncapable manager, and the estate now brings in a fair income. Nikolai\\nPetrovitch, too, is constant in his endeavours to make peace on the\\nproperty, and, riding systematically round it, delivers long speeches\\nin the belief that only need the peasantry be \"reasoned with\"--that is\\nto say, plied with the same words over and over again--for the _muzhik_\\ngradually to become a tractable animal. Yet Nikolai earns the approval\\nneither of the educated gentry, who speak with affected jauntiness of\\nthe coming \"\\'mancipation\"[2] (they invariably give the syllable \"an\" a\\nnasal inflection), nor of those uneducated landowners who roundly curse\\nwhat they term \"that ----\\'_mun_cipation.\" In other words, for both\\nclasses Nikolai Petrovitch is too \"mild.\"\\n\\nKaterina Sergievna has had a son born to her, and named him Kolia;\\nMitia is now a big, active, volubly lisping boy; and Thenichka (rather,\\nTheodosia Nikolaievna) adores her daughter-in-law only less than her\\nhusband and Mitia. In fact, that adoration reaches the point that,\\nshould Katia sit down to the piano, Thenichka cannot leave her though\\nthe playing continue all day.\\n\\nThen a word concerning Peter the valet. As much a lump of mingled\\nstupidity and conceit as ever, he still pronounces his e\\'s as u\\'s, but\\nhas taken unto himself a wife, and, with her, a respectable dowry. The\\ndaughter of a market gardener of the neighbouring town, she had already\\nrefused two eligible _partis_ solely on the ground that they did not\\npossess watches! But Peter possesses not only a watch, but also a pair\\nof patent leather pumps.\\n\\nAgain, any day on the Brühl Terrace, in Dresden, you may meet, between\\ntwo and four o\\'clock in the afternoon (the fashionable hour for a\\npromenade), a man of about fifty. Grey-headed, and afflicted with gout,\\nyet still handsome, he is elegantly dressed, and stamped with that air\\nof good breeding which comes only of long association with elevated\\nstrata of society. That man is Paul Petrovitch. Having left Moscow for\\nforeign parts for his health\\'s sake, he has settled in Dresden for\\nthe reason that there he possesses the largest number of English and\\nnomad-Russian acquaintances. Towards the former he bears himself with\\nsimplicity, and almost with modesty, but with a touch of _hauteur_;\\nand, in return, the English look upon him as a trifle tedious, but\\nrespect him on the score of his being \"quite a gentleman.\" In the\\npresence of the Russian element, however, Paul Petrovitch is more\\nfree and easy--he gives rein unstintedly to his sarcasm, and rallies\\nboth his compatriots and himself. Yet from _him_ such things come\\npleasantly, and with a gay _insouciance,_ and in a becoming manner;\\nwhile, in addition, he holds Slavophil views--views which (as we all\\nknow) invariably induce the great world to rate their holder a person\\n_très distingué_. True, never by any chance does Paul read a Russian\\nbook; yet by way of compensation, there stands on his writing-table\\na silver ash-tray shaped like a _muzhik\\'s_ clog. Moreover, from some\\nof our Russian tourists he receives considerable attention when they\\nhappen to be passing through the town; and even our old friend Matvei\\nIlyitch Koliazin, on finding himself \"in temporary opposition,\" has\\npaid him a visit while _en route_ to Bohemia for a course of the\\nwaters. In fact, the only persons who show Paul no deference at all are\\nthe native Germans, whose society he does not greatly cultivate. Yet\\neven they agree that, in the matter of obtaining tickets for the Court\\nChapel or the theatre and so forth, none is so clever, so dexterous, as\\n\"der Herr Baron von Kirsanov.\" In fact, always does he do \"the right\\nthing\" so far as he is able; and even yet he can create some stir,\\nowing to the fact that he has once, and to good purpose, been a social\\nlion. Yet life presses upon him not a little heavily--more heavily\\nthan he himself is aware. Merely need one look at him as, huddled\\nagainst the aisle wall of the Russian church, he sits plunged in\\nthought, with his lips bitterly compressed, and continues sitting there\\nuntil, remembering his surroundings, he makes, almost imperceptibly,\\nthe sign of the cross. In similar fashion, Madame Kukshin has gone\\nabroad--in her case, to Heidelberg, where she is engaged in studying,\\nnot natural science, but architecture--a branch wherein she has,\\naccording to herself, \"discovered several new laws.\" Also, still she\\nis hail-fellow-well-met with students, more especially with some of\\nthose Russian physicists and chemists who swarm in Heidelberg, and who,\\nthough at first flabbergasting the simple-minded German professors with\\nthe moderation of their views, subsequently proceed to flabbergast\\nthose professors with the wholeheartedness of their sloth. In fact, it\\nis of two or three of those chemistry students who, though unable to\\ndistinguish even oxygen from azote, are yet charged to the brim with\\nconceit and the spirit of \"denial,\" that Madame Kukshin\\'s circle is\\nchiefly composed.\\n\\nSimilarly, friend Sitnikov is preparing to become a great man. For\\nwhich purpose he is flaunting it in St. Petersburg, and (to quote\\nhis own expression) \"carrying on the work of the late Bazarov.\"\\nTrue, rumour declares that some one has recently given him a second\\nthrashing; as also that he (Sitnikov) has declined to face the\\nmusic--rather, that he has preferred to hint in an obscure article in\\nan equally obscure newspaper that his assailant is the coward; but to\\nthis report Sitnikov merely attaches the epithet \"ironical.\" For the\\nrest, his father continues to send him remittances, while his wife\\naccounts him equally a _littérateur_ and a fool.\\n\\nLastly, in a remote corner of Russia there lies a little country\\ncemetery. Like most cemeteries of the kind, it is depressing of aspect.\\nOver its fences dense masses of weed have grown, its drab wooden\\ncrosses are rickety and turning mouldy under their blistered, painted\\ncanopies, its stone paths have lost their alignment, and look as though\\nsome one has displaced them from below, its two or three ragged trees\\ndiffuse only the scantiest of shade, and sheep wander unhindered over\\nits tombs. But among those tombs there lies a grave which no man\\nmolests and no animal tramples upon: only the birds perch upon it and\\nsing as evening falls. For around that grave stands an iron railing,\\nand at its head and foot are planted two young fir trees. It is the\\ngrave of Evgenii Vasilitch Bazarov. Occasionally from the neighbouring\\nmanor-house there come two aged and decrepit folk, a man and his wife.\\nSupporting one another with a step which ever grows heavier, they\\napproach the railing, sink upon their knees, and weep long, bitter\\ntears as they gaze at the dumb headstone where their son lies sleeping.\\nThen they exchange a word or two, dust the stone with assiduous care,\\nlay upon it a sprig of fir, and offer a last petition. Yet even then\\nthey can scarce bear to tear themselves from the spot where they can\\ndraw nearest to their son, and to their memories of him.\\n\\nBut are those tears, those prayers, all fruitless? Is that love, that\\nhallowed, selfless love, of theirs to be wholly unavailing? No, no,\\nand a thousand times no! For, though the heart which lies within that\\ntomb may have been passionate and wild and erring, the flowers which\\nbloom in that spot contemplate us with eyes of naught but peace and\\ninnocence, and speak to us of naught but the eternal, mighty calm of\\n\"unheeding\" nature, as an image of the Eternal Reconciliation, and of\\nthe Life which shall have no End.\\n\\n\\n[1] In the text this word is given in English.\\n\\n[2] _i.e._ the emancipation of the serfs, which was carried out in 1861.\\n',\n",

In this\\n     fragment, entitled \"Underground,\" this person\\n     introduces himself and his views, and, as it were,\\n     tries to explain the causes owing to which he has\\n     made his appearance and was bound to make his\\n     appearance in our midst.  In the second fragment\\n     there are added the actual notes of this person\\n     concerning certain events in his life.--AUTHOR\\'S NOTE.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nI am a sick man....  I am a spiteful man.  I am an unattractive man.  I\\nbelieve my liver is diseased.  However, I know nothing at all about my\\ndisease, and do not know for certain what ails me.  I don\\'t consult a\\ndoctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and\\ndoctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to\\nrespect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be\\nsuperstitious, but I am superstitious).  No, I refuse to consult a\\ndoctor from spite.  That you probably will not understand.  Well, I\\nunderstand it, though.  Of course, I can\\'t explain who it is precisely\\nthat I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well\\naware that I cannot \"pay out\" the doctors by not consulting them; I\\nknow better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and\\nno one else.  But still, if I don\\'t consult a doctor it is from spite.\\nMy liver is bad, well--let it get worse!\\n\\nI have been going on like that for a long time--twenty years.  Now I am\\nforty.  I used to be in the government service, but am no longer.  I\\nwas a spiteful official.  I was rude and took pleasure in being so.  I\\ndid not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in\\nthat, at least.  (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out.  I wrote\\nit thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself\\nthat I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch\\nit out on purpose!)\\n\\nWhen petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I\\nsat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when\\nI succeeded in making anybody unhappy.  I almost did succeed.  For the\\nmost part they were all timid people--of course, they were petitioners.\\nBut of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not\\nendure.  He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a\\ndisgusting way.  I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over\\nthat sword.  At last I got the better of him.  He left off clanking it.\\nThat happened in my youth, though.\\n\\nBut do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?\\nWhy, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that\\ncontinually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly\\nconscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an\\nembittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and\\namusing myself by it.  I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll\\nto play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should\\nbe appeased.  I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I\\nshould grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with\\nshame for months after.  That was my way.\\n\\nI was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official.  I was\\nlying from spite.  I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and\\nwith the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful.  I was\\nconscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely\\nopposite to that.  I felt them positively swarming in me, these\\nopposite elements. I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life\\nand craving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not\\nlet them, purposely would not let them come out.  They tormented me\\ntill I was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and--sickened me, at\\nlast, how they sickened me!  Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that\\nI am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your\\nforgiveness for something?  I am sure you are fancying that ...\\nHowever, I assure you I do not care if you are....\\n\\nIt was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to\\nbecome anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an\\nhonest man, neither a hero nor an insect.  Now, I am living out my life\\nin my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation\\nthat an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is\\nonly the fool who becomes anything.  Yes, a man in the nineteenth\\ncentury must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless\\ncreature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a limited\\ncreature.  That is my conviction of forty years.  I am forty years old\\nnow, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is\\nextreme old age.  To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is\\nvulgar, immoral.  Who does live beyond forty?  Answer that, sincerely\\nand honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows.  I\\ntell all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all\\nthese silver-haired and reverend seniors!  I tell the whole world that\\nto its face!  I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to\\nsixty myself.  To seventy!  To eighty! ...  Stay, let me take breath\\n...\\n\\nYou imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you.  You are\\nmistaken in that, too.  I am by no means such a mirthful person as you\\nimagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble\\n(and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I\\nam--then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor.  I was in the\\nservice that I might have something to eat (and solely for that\\nreason), and when last year a distant relation left me six thousand\\nroubles in his will I immediately retired from the service and settled\\ndown in my corner.  I used to live in this corner before, but now I\\nhave settled down in it.  My room is a wretched, horrid one in the\\noutskirts of the town.  My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured\\nfrom stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her.\\nI am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my\\nsmall means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg.  I know all\\nthat better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and\\nmonitors....  But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away\\nfrom Petersburg!  I am not going away because ... ech!  Why, it is\\nabsolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away.\\n\\nBut what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?\\n\\nAnswer: Of himself.\\n\\nWell, so I will talk about myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nI want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not,\\nwhy I could not even become an insect.  I tell you solemnly, that I\\nhave many times tried to become an insect.  But I was not equal even to\\nthat.  I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness--a\\nreal thorough-going illness.  For man\\'s everyday needs, it would have\\nbeen quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is,\\nhalf or a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated\\nman of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal\\nill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional\\ntown on the whole terrestrial globe.  (There are intentional and\\nunintentional towns.)  It would have been quite enough, for instance,\\nto have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men\\nof action live.  I bet you think I am writing all this from\\naffectation, to be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is\\nmore, that from ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my\\nofficer.  But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and\\neven swagger over them?\\n\\nThough, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on\\ntheir diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone.  We will not\\ndispute it; my contention was absurd.  But yet I am firmly persuaded\\nthat a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in\\nfact, is a disease.  I stick to that.  Let us leave that, too, for a\\nminute.  Tell me this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the\\nvery moments when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all\\nthat is \"sublime and beautiful,\" as they used to say at one time, it\\nwould, as though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do\\nsuch ugly things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all,\\nperhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the\\nvery time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be\\ncommitted.  The more conscious I was of goodness and of all that was\\n\"sublime and beautiful,\" the more deeply I sank into my mire and the\\nmore ready I was to sink in it altogether.  But the chief point was\\nthat all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it\\nwere bound to be so.  It was as though it were my most normal\\ncondition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last\\nall desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed.  It ended\\nby my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was\\nperhaps my normal condition.  But at first, in the beginning, what\\nagonies I endured in that struggle!  I did not believe it was the same\\nwith other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a\\nsecret.  I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the\\npoint of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in\\nreturning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night,\\nacutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action\\nagain, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly\\ngnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at\\nlast the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness,\\nand at last--into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into\\nenjoyment!  I insist upon that.  I have spoken of this because I keep\\nwanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?  I\\nwill explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness\\nof one\\'s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had\\nreached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not\\nbe otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could\\nbecome a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you\\nto change into something different you would most likely not wish to\\nchange; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because\\nperhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.\\n\\nAnd the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in\\naccord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness,\\nand with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that\\nconsequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely\\nnothing.  Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,\\nthat one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any\\nconsolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he\\nactually is a scoundrel.  But enough....  Ech, I have talked a lot of\\nnonsense, but what have I explained?  How is enjoyment in this to be\\nexplained?  But I will explain it.  I will get to the bottom of it!\\nThat is why I have taken up my pen....\\n\\nI, for instance, have a great deal of AMOUR PROPRE.  I am as suspicious\\nand prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf.  But upon my word I\\nsometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in the\\nface I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.  I say, in\\nearnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that\\na peculiar sort of enjoyment--the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but\\nin despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one\\nis very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one\\'s position.  And\\nwhen one is slapped in the face--why then the consciousness of being\\nrubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one.  The worst of it is,\\nlook at it which way one will, it still turns out that I was always the\\nmost to blame in everything.  And what is most humiliating of all, to\\nblame for no fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of\\nnature.  In the first place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of\\nthe people surrounding me.  (I have always considered myself cleverer\\nthan any of the people surrounding me, and sometimes, would you believe\\nit, have been positively ashamed of it.  At any rate, I have all my\\nlife, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people\\nstraight in the face.)  To blame, finally, because even if I had had\\nmagnanimity, I should only have had more suffering from the sense of\\nits uselessness.  I should certainly have never been able to do\\nanything from being magnanimous--neither to forgive, for my assailant\\nwould perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot\\nforgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to\\nthe laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.  Finally, even if I\\nhad wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary\\nto revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged myself on\\nany one for anything because I should certainly never have made up my\\nmind to do anything, even if I had been able to.  Why should I not have\\nmade up my mind?  About that in particular I want to say a few words.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nWith people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for\\nthemselves in general, how is it done?  Why, when they are possessed,\\nlet us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is\\nnothing else but that feeling left in their whole being.  Such a\\ngentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull\\nwith its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him.  (By the\\nway: facing the wall, such gentlemen--that is, the \"direct\" persons and\\nmen of action--are genuinely nonplussed.  For them a wall is not an\\nevasion, as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is\\nnot an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very\\nglad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule.  No, they\\nare nonplussed in all sincerity.  The wall has for them something\\ntranquillising, morally soothing, final--maybe even something\\nmysterious ... but of the wall later.)\\n\\nWell, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his\\ntender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him\\ninto being on the earth.  I envy such a man till I am green in the\\nface.  He is stupid.  I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal\\nman should be stupid, how do you know?  Perhaps it is very beautiful,\\nin fact.  And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can\\ncall it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis\\nof the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has\\ncome, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this\\nis almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this\\nretort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his\\nantithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely\\nthinks of himself as a mouse and not a man.  It may be an acutely\\nconscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and\\ntherefore, et caetera, et caetera.  And the worst of it is, he himself,\\nhis very own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do\\nso; and that is an important point.  Now let us look at this mouse in\\naction.  Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and\\nit almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too.\\nThere may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in L\\'HOMME\\nDE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE.  The base and nasty desire to vent that\\nspite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in\\nL\\'HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE.  For through his innate stupidity\\nthe latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in\\nconsequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in\\nthe justice of it.  To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act\\nof revenge.  Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless\\nmouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the\\nform of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many\\nunsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of\\nfatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of\\nthe contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand\\nsolemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their\\nhealthy sides ache.  Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss\\nall that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt\\nin which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its\\nmouse-hole.  There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our\\ninsulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in\\ncold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite.  For forty years\\ntogether it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most\\nignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still\\nmore ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own\\nimagination.  It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it\\nwill recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will\\ninvent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things\\nmight happen, and will forgive nothing.  Maybe it will begin to revenge\\nitself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind\\nthe stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to\\nvengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its\\nefforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom\\nit revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself.\\nOn its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest\\naccumulated over all the years and ...\\n\\nBut it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in\\nthat conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for\\nforty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful\\nhopelessness of one\\'s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires\\nturned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined\\nfor ever and repented of again a minute later--that the savour of that\\nstrange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies.  It is so subtle, so\\ndifficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even\\nsimply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of\\nit.  \"Possibly,\" you will add on your own account with a grin, \"people\\nwill not understand it either who have never received a slap in the\\nface,\" and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,\\nperhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and\\nso I speak as one who knows.  I bet that you are thinking that.  But\\nset your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the\\nface, though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you\\nmay think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given\\nso few slaps in the face during my life.  But enough ... not another\\nword on that subject of such extreme interest to you.\\n\\nI will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not\\nunderstand a certain refinement of enjoyment.  Though in certain\\ncircumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though\\nthis, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have\\nsaid already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once.  The\\nimpossible means the stone wall!  What stone wall?  Why, of course, the\\nlaws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics.  As\\nsoon as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a\\nmonkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact.  When they\\nprove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to\\nyou than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this\\nconclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties\\nand all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it,\\nthere is no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics.  Just\\ntry refuting it.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a\\ncase of twice two makes four!  Nature does not ask your permission, she\\nhas nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or\\ndislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently\\nall her conclusions.  A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so\\non.\"\\n\\nMerciful Heavens!  but what do I care for the laws of nature and\\narithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact\\nthat twice two makes four?  Of course I cannot break through the wall\\nby battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to\\nknock it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because\\nit is a stone wall and I have not the strength.\\n\\nAs though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did\\ncontain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as\\ntwice two makes four.  Oh, absurdity of absurdities!  How much better\\nit is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the\\nimpossibilities and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of\\nthose impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be\\nreconciled to it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical\\ncombinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting\\ntheme, that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame,\\nthough again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the least,\\nand therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into\\nluxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for\\nyou to feel vindictive against, that you have not, and perhaps never\\nwill have, an object for your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a\\nbit of juggling, a card-sharper\\'s trick, that it is simply a mess, no\\nknowing what and no knowing who, but in spite of all these\\nuncertainties and jugglings, still there is an ache in you, and the\\nmore you do not know, the worse the ache.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!  You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next,\" you\\ncry, with a laugh.\\n\\n\"Well, even in toothache there is enjoyment,\" I answer.  I had\\ntoothache for a whole month and I know there is.  In that case, of\\ncourse, people are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not\\ncandid moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole\\npoint.  The enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans;\\nif he did not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan.  It is a good\\nexample, gentlemen, and I will develop it.  Those moans express in the\\nfirst place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating\\nto your consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you\\nspit disdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same\\nwhile she does not.  They express the consciousness that you have no\\nenemy to punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in\\nspite of all possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your\\nteeth; that if someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and\\nif he does not, they will go on aching another three months; and that\\nfinally if you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is\\nleft you for your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your\\nwall with your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more.\\nWell, these mortal insults, these jeers on the part of someone unknown,\\nend at last in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree\\nof voluptuousness.  I ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans\\nof an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache,\\non the second or third day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan,\\nnot as he moaned on the first day, that is, not simply because he has\\ntoothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by\\nprogress and European civilisation, a man who is \"divorced from the\\nsoil and the national elements,\" as they express it now-a-days.  His\\nmoans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days\\nand nights.  And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no\\nsort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is\\nonly lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows\\nthat even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his\\nwhole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha\\'porth of\\nfaith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,\\nmore simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing\\nhimself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy.  Well, in all these\\nrecognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure.\\nAs though he would say: \"I am worrying you, I am lacerating your\\nhearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake.  Well, stay awake\\nthen, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache.  I am not a\\nhero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person,\\nan impostor.  Well, so be it, then!  I am very glad that you see\\nthrough me.  It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let\\nit be nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a\\nminute....\"  You do not understand even now, gentlemen?  No, it seems\\nour  development and our consciousness must go further to understand\\nall the intricacies of this pleasure.  You laugh?  Delighted.  My\\njests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking\\nself-confidence.  But of course that is because I do not respect\\nmyself.  Can a man of perception respect himself at all?\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nCome, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of\\nhis own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself?  I am\\nnot saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse.  And, indeed, I\\ncould never endure saying, \"Forgive me, Papa, I won\\'t do it again,\" not\\nbecause I am incapable of saying that--on the contrary, perhaps just\\nbecause I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too.  As\\nthough of design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to\\nblame in any way.  That was the nastiest part of it.  At the same time\\nI was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of\\ncourse, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there\\nwas a sick feeling in my heart at the time....  For that one could not\\nblame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have\\ncontinually all my life offended me more than anything.  It is\\nloathsome to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then.  Of\\ncourse, a minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all\\na lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence,\\nthis emotion, these vows of reform.  You will ask why did I worry\\nmyself with such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with\\none\\'s hands folded, and so one began cutting capers.  That is really\\nit.  Observe yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will\\nunderstand that it is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up\\na life, so as at least to live in some way.  How many times it has\\nhappened to me--well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose,\\nfor nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at\\nnothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last\\nto the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an\\nimpulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it\\nin myself.  Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love.\\nI suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you.  In the depth of my heart\\nthere was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but\\nyet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside\\nmyself ... and it was all from ENNUI, gentlemen, all from ENNUI;\\ninertia overcame me.  You know the direct, legitimate fruit of\\nconsciousness is inertia, that is, conscious\\nsitting-with-the-hands-folded.  I have referred to this already.  I\\nrepeat, I repeat with emphasis: all \"direct\" persons and men of action\\nare active just because they are stupid and limited.  How explain that?\\nI will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate\\nand secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade\\nthemselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have\\nfound an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are\\nat ease and you know that is the chief thing.  To begin to act, you\\nknow, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of\\ndoubt left in it.  Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest?\\nWhere are the primary causes on which I am to build?  Where are my\\nfoundations?  Where am I to get them from?  I exercise myself in\\nreflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws\\nafter itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity.  That\\nis just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection.  It\\nmust be a case of the laws of nature again.  What is the result of it\\nin the end?  Why, just the same.  Remember I spoke just now of\\nvengeance.  (I am sure you did not take it in.)  I said that a man\\nrevenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found\\na primary cause, that is, justice.  And so he is at rest on all sides,\\nand consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully,\\nbeing persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing.  But I see no\\njustice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently\\nif I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite.  Spite, of\\ncourse, might overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve\\nquite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is\\nnot a cause.  But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began\\nwith that just now, you know).  In consequence again of those accursed\\nlaws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical\\ndisintegration.  You look into it, the object flies off into air, your\\nreasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes\\nnot a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no\\none is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left\\nagain--that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can.  So you give it up\\nwith a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause.\\nAnd try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly,\\nwithout reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at\\nleast for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands\\nfolded.  The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin\\ndespising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself.  Result: a\\nsoap-bubble and inertia.  Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I\\nconsider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have\\nbeen able neither to begin nor to finish anything.  Granted I am a\\nbabbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us.  But what is to\\nbe done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is\\nbabble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nOh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness!  Heavens, how I should\\nhave respected myself, then.  I should have respected myself because I\\nshould at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least\\nhave been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could\\nhave believed myself.  Question:  What is he?  Answer:  A sluggard; how\\nvery pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself!  It would\\nmean that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was\\nsomething to say about me. \"Sluggard\"--why, it is a calling and\\nvocation, it is a career.  Do not jest, it is so.  I should then be a\\nmember of the best club by right, and should find my occupation in\\ncontinually respecting myself.  I knew a gentleman who prided himself\\nall his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte.  He considered this as\\nhis positive virtue, and never doubted himself.  He died, not simply\\nwith a tranquil, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite\\nright, too.  Then I should have chosen a career for myself, I should\\nhave been a sluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for\\ninstance, one with sympathies for everything sublime and beautiful.\\nHow do you like that?  I have long had visions of it.  That \"sublime\\nand beautiful\" weighs heavily on my mind at forty But that is at forty;\\nthen--oh, then it would have been different!  I should have found for\\nmyself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking\\nto the health of everything \"sublime and beautiful.\"  I should have\\nsnatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to\\ndrain it to all that is \"sublime and beautiful.\"  I should then have\\nturned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the nastiest,\\nunquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and the\\nbeautiful.  I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge.  An artist,\\nfor instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay.  At once I drink to the\\nhealth of the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I\\nlove all that is \"sublime and beautiful.\"  An author has written AS YOU\\nWILL: at once I drink to the health of \"anyone you will\" because I love\\nall that is \"sublime and beautiful.\"\\n\\nI should claim respect for doing so.  I should persecute anyone who\\nwould not show me respect.  I should live at ease, I should die with\\ndignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming!  And what a good\\nround belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have\\nestablished, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so\\nthat everyone would have said, looking at me: \"Here is an asset!  Here\\nis something real and solid!\"  And, say what you like, it is very\\nagreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age.\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nBut these are all golden dreams.  Oh, tell me, who was it first\\nannounced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things\\nbecause he does not know his own interests; and that if he were\\nenlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man\\nwould at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and\\nnoble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,\\nhe would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all\\nknow that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,\\nconsequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good?\\nOh, the babe!  Oh, the pure, innocent child!  Why, in the first place,\\nwhen in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has\\nacted only from his own interest?  What is to be done with the millions\\nof facts that bear witness that men, CONSCIOUSLY, that is fully\\nunderstanding their real interests, have left them in the background\\nand have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger,\\ncompelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were,\\nsimply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully,\\nstruck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the\\ndarkness.  So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter\\nto them than any advantage....  Advantage! What is advantage?  And will\\nyou take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the\\nadvantage of man consists?  And what if it so happens that a man\\'s\\nadvantage, SOMETIMES, not only may, but even must, consist in his\\ndesiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not\\nadvantageous.  And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole\\nprinciple falls into dust.  What do you think--are there such cases?\\nYou laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man\\'s\\nadvantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty?  Are there not some\\nwhich not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included\\nunder any classification?  You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the\\naverages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas.  Your\\nadvantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace--and so on, and so\\non. So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly\\nin opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine,\\ntoo, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he?\\nBut, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that\\nall these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon\\nup human advantages invariably leave out one?  They don\\'t even take it\\ninto their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the\\nwhole reckoning depends upon that.  It would be no greater matter, they\\nwould simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list.\\nBut the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any\\nclassification and is not in place in any list.  I have a friend for\\ninstance ...  Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and\\nindeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend!  When he\\nprepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to\\nyou, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with\\nthe laws of reason and truth.  What is more, he will talk to you with\\nexcitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony\\nhe will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own\\ninterests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter\\nof an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through\\nsomething inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will\\ngo off on quite a different tack--that is, act in direct opposition to\\nwhat he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws\\nof reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to\\neverything ...  I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and\\ntherefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual.  The fact is,\\ngentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to\\nalmost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)\\nthere is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which\\nwe spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than\\nall other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready\\nto act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason,\\nhonour, peace, prosperity--in fact, in opposition to all those\\nexcellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental,\\nmost advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all.  \"Yes, but\\nit\\'s advantage all the same,\" you will retort.  But excuse me, I\\'ll\\nmake the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What\\nmatters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that\\nit breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every\\nsystem constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind.  In\\nfact, it upsets everything.  But before I mention this advantage to\\nyou, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly\\ndeclare that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining\\nto mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably\\nstriving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and\\nnoble--are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises!  Yes,\\nlogical exercises.  Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of\\nmankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind\\nalmost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle,\\nthat through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less\\nbloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare.  Logically it does seem to\\nfollow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems\\nand abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth\\nintentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to\\njustify his logic.  I take this example because it is the most glaring\\ninstance of it.  Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams,\\nand in the merriest way, as though it were champagne.  Take the whole\\nof the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived.  Take Napoleon--the\\nGreat and also the present one.  Take North America--the eternal union.\\nTake the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that\\ncivilisation softens in us?  The only gain of civilisation for mankind\\nis the greater capacity for variety of sensations--and absolutely\\nnothing more.  And through the development of this many-sidedness man\\nmay come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed.  In fact, this has already\\nhappened to him.  Have you noticed that it is the most civilised\\ngentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas\\nand Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so\\nconspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they\\nare so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to\\nus.  In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more\\nbloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty.  In\\nold days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace\\nexterminated those he thought proper.  Now we do think bloodshed\\nabominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy\\nthan ever. Which is worse?  Decide that for yourselves.  They say that\\nCleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking\\ngold pins into her slave-girls\\' breasts and derived gratification from\\ntheir screams and writhings.  You will say that that was in the\\ncomparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too,\\nbecause also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that\\nthough man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages,\\nhe is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would\\ndictate.  But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn\\nwhen he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and\\nscience have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a\\nnormal direction.  You are confident that then man will cease from\\nINTENTIONAL error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set\\nhis will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say,\\nscience itself will teach man (though to my mind it\\'s a superfluous\\nluxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own,\\nand that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the\\nstop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws\\nof nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it,\\nbut is done of itself, by the laws of nature.  Consequently we have\\nonly to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to\\nanswer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him.\\nAll human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these\\nlaws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and\\nentered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain\\nedifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which\\neverything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will\\nbe no more incidents or adventures in the world.\\n\\nThen--this is all what you say--new economic relations will be\\nestablished, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical\\nexactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the\\ntwinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be\\nprovided.  Then the \"Palace of Crystal\" will be built.  Then ...  In\\nfact, those will be halcyon days.  Of course there is no guaranteeing\\n(this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully\\ndull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be\\ncalculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be\\nextraordinarily rational.  Of course boredom may lead you to anything.\\nIt is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that\\nwould not matter.  What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I\\ndare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then.  Man is\\nstupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all\\nstupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like\\nhim in all creation.  I, for instance, would not be in the least\\nsurprised if all of a sudden, A PROPOS of nothing, in the midst of\\ngeneral prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a\\nreactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his\\narms akimbo, say to us all: \"I say, gentleman, hadn\\'t we better kick\\nover the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to\\nsend these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more\\nat our own sweet foolish will!\" That again would not matter, but what\\nis annoying is that he would be sure to find followers--such is the\\nnature of man.  And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one\\nwould think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere\\nand at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose\\nand not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated.  And one may\\nchoose what is contrary to one\\'s own interests, and sometimes one\\nPOSITIVELY OUGHT (that is my idea).  One\\'s own free unfettered choice,\\none\\'s own caprice, however wild it may be, one\\'s own fancy worked up at\\ntimes to frenzy--is that very \"most advantageous advantage\" which we\\nhave overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which\\nall systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms.  And\\nhow do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?\\nWhat has made them conceive that man must want a rationally\\nadvantageous choice?  What man wants is simply INDEPENDENT choice,\\nwhatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead.  And\\nchoice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha!  But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality,\\nsay what you like,\" you will interpose with a chuckle.  \"Science has\\nsucceeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and\\nwhat is called freedom of will is nothing else than--\"\\n\\nStay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was\\nrather frightened.  I was just going to say that the devil only knows\\nwhat choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing,\\nbut I remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up.  And\\nhere you have begun upon it.  Indeed, if there really is some day\\ndiscovered a formula for all our desires and caprices--that is, an\\nexplanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they\\ndevelop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on,\\nthat is a real mathematical formula--then, most likely, man will at\\nonce cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to.  For who\\nwould want to choose by rule?  Besides, he will at once be transformed\\nfrom a human being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for\\nwhat is a man without desires, without free will and without choice, if\\nnot a stop in an organ?  What do you think?  Let us reckon the\\nchances--can such a thing happen or not?\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" you decide.  \"Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view\\nof our advantage.  We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our\\nfoolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a\\nsupposed advantage.  But when all that is explained and worked out on\\npaper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and\\nsenseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never\\nunderstand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist.\\nFor if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then\\nreason and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our\\nreason to be SENSELESS in our desires, and in that way knowingly act\\nagainst reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and\\nreasoning can be really calculated--because there will some day be\\ndiscovered the laws of our so-called free will--so, joking apart, there\\nmay one day be something like a table constructed of them, so that we\\nreally shall choose in accordance with it.  If, for instance, some day\\nthey calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone\\nbecause I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do\\nit in that particular way, what FREEDOM is left me, especially if I am\\na learned man and have taken my degree somewhere?  Then I should be\\nable to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand.  In short,\\nif this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do;\\nanyway, we should have to understand that.  And, in fact, we ought\\nunwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in\\nsuch and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have\\ngot to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if\\nwe really aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to\\nthe chemical retort, there\\'s no help for it, we must accept the retort\\ntoo, or else it will be accepted without our consent....\"\\n\\nYes, but here I come to a stop!  Gentlemen, you must excuse me for\\nbeing over-philosophical; it\\'s the result of forty years underground!\\nAllow me to indulge my fancy.  You see, gentlemen, reason is an\\nexcellent thing, there\\'s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but\\nreason and satisfies only the rational side of man\\'s nature, while will\\nis a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life\\nincluding reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this\\nmanifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply\\nextracting square roots.  Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to\\nlive, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my\\ncapacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my\\ncapacity for life.  What does reason know?  Reason only knows what it\\nhas succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn;\\nthis is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature\\nacts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or\\nunconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives.  I suspect,\\ngentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me\\nagain that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the\\nfuture man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous\\nto himself, that that can be proved mathematically.  I thoroughly\\nagree, it can--by mathematics.  But I repeat for the hundredth time,\\nthere is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely,\\ndesire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very\\nstupid--simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even\\nwhat is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only\\nwhat is sensible.  Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of\\nours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than\\nanything else on earth, especially in certain cases.  And in particular\\nit may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us\\nobvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason\\nconcerning our advantage--for in any circumstances it preserves for us\\nwhat is most precious and most important--that is, our personality, our\\nindividuality.  Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most\\nprecious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in\\nagreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept\\nwithin bounds.  It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy.  But\\nvery often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly\\nopposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is\\nprofitable, sometimes even praiseworthy?  Gentlemen, let us suppose\\nthat man is not stupid.  (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if\\nonly from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is\\nwise?)  But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful!\\nPhenomenally ungrateful.  In fact, I believe that the best definition\\nof man is the ungrateful biped.  But that is not all, that is not his\\nworst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity,\\nperpetual--from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period.\\nMoral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long\\nbeen accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than\\nmoral obliquity.  Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the\\nhistory of mankind.  What will you see?  Is it a grand spectacle?\\nGrand, if you like.  Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that\\'s\\nworth something.  With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that\\nsome say that it is the work of man\\'s hands, while others maintain that\\nit has been created by nature herself.  Is it many-coloured?  May be it\\nis many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and\\ncivilian, of all peoples in all ages--that alone is worth something,\\nand if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of\\nit; no historian would be equal to the job.  Is it monotonous? May be\\nit\\'s monotonous too: it\\'s fighting and fighting; they are fighting now,\\nthey fought first and they fought last--you will admit, that it is\\nalmost too monotonous.  In short, one may say anything about the\\nhistory of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered\\nimagination. The only thing one can\\'t say is that it\\'s rational.  The\\nvery word sticks in one\\'s throat.  And, indeed, this is the odd thing\\nthat is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life\\nmoral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it\\ntheir object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as\\npossible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in\\norder to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally\\nin this world.  And yet we all know that those very people sooner or\\nlater have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a\\nmost unseemly one.  Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he\\nis a being endowed with strange qualities?  Shower upon him every\\nearthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but\\nbubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic\\nprosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat\\ncakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even\\nthen out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some\\nnasty trick.  He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately\\ndesire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply\\nto introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic\\nelement.  It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he\\nwill desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though\\nthat were so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a\\npiano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that\\nsoon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar.  And that\\nis not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if\\nthis were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then\\nhe would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something\\nperverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point.  And if\\nhe does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will\\ncontrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point!  He will\\nlaunch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his\\nprivilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may\\nbe by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince\\nhimself that he is a man and not a piano-key!  If you say that all\\nthis, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and\\ncurses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand\\nwould stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would\\npurposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point!  I\\nbelieve in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems\\nto consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a\\nman and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be\\nby cannibalism!  And this being so, can one help being tempted to\\nrejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on\\nsomething we don\\'t know?\\n\\nYou will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one\\nis touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my\\nwill should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own\\nnormal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.\\n\\nGood heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to\\ntabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make\\nfour?  Twice two makes four without my will.  As if free will meant\\nthat!\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nGentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not\\nbrilliant, but you know one can take everything as a joke.  I am,\\nperhaps, jesting against the grain.  Gentlemen, I am tormented by\\nquestions; answer them for me.  You, for instance, want to cure men of\\ntheir old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and\\ngood sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also\\nthat it is DESIRABLE to reform man in that way?  And what leads you to\\nthe conclusion that man\\'s inclinations NEED reforming?  In short, how\\ndo you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man?  And to\\ngo to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that\\nnot to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the\\nconclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous\\nfor man and must always be a law for mankind?  So far, you know, this\\nis only your supposition.  It may be the law of logic, but not the law\\nof humanity.  You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad?  Allow me to\\ndefend myself.  I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal,\\npredestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in\\nengineering--that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads,\\nWHEREVER THEY MAY LEAD.  But the reason why he wants sometimes to go\\noff at a tangent may just be that he is PREDESTINED to make the road,\\nand perhaps, too, that however stupid the \"direct\" practical man may\\nbe, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always\\ndoes lead SOMEWHERE, and that the destination it leads to is less\\nimportant than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to\\nsave the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving\\nway to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all\\nthe vices.  Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact\\nbeyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction\\nand chaos also?  Tell me that!  But on that point I want to say a\\ncouple of words myself.  May it not be that he loves chaos and\\ndestruction (there can be no disputing that he does sometimes love it)\\nbecause he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and\\ncompleting the edifice he is constructing?  Who knows, perhaps he only\\nloves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in love with it\\nat close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does not want\\nto live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of LES\\nANIMAUX DOMESTIQUES--such as the ants, the sheep, and so on.  Now the\\nants have quite a different taste.  They have a marvellous edifice of\\nthat pattern which endures for ever--the ant-heap.\\n\\nWith the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the\\nant-heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to\\ntheir perseverance and good sense.  But man is a frivolous and\\nincongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the\\nprocess of the game, not the end of it.  And who knows (there is no\\nsaying with certainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind\\nis striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other\\nwords, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must\\nalways be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four,\\nand such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of\\ndeath.  Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical\\ncertainty, and I am afraid of it now.  Granted that man does nothing\\nbut seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices\\nhis life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I\\nassure you.  He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing\\nfor him to look for.  When workmen have finished their work they do at\\nleast receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to\\nthe police-station--and there is occupation for a week.  But where can\\nman go?  Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when\\nhe has attained such objects.  He loves the process of attaining, but\\ndoes not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very\\nabsurd.  In fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind\\nof jest in it all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all,\\nsomething insufferable.  Twice two makes four seems to me simply a\\npiece of insolence.  Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands\\nwith arms akimbo barring your path and spitting.  I admit that twice\\ntwo makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything\\nits due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.\\n\\nAnd why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the\\nnormal and the positive--in other words, only what is conducive to\\nwelfare--is for the advantage of man?  Is not reason in error as\\nregards advantage?  Does not man, perhaps, love something besides\\nwell-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?  Perhaps suffering\\nis just as great a benefit to him as well-being?  Man is sometimes\\nextraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a\\nfact.  There is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that;\\nonly ask yourself, if you are a man and have lived at all.  As far as\\nmy personal opinion is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to\\nme positively ill-bred.  Whether it\\'s good or bad, it is sometimes very\\npleasant, too, to smash things.  I hold no brief for suffering nor for\\nwell-being either.  I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being\\nguaranteed to me when necessary.  Suffering would be out of place in\\nvaudevilles, for instance; I know that.  In the \"Palace of Crystal\" it\\nis unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the\\ngood of a \"palace of crystal\" if there could be any doubt about it?\\nAnd yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is,\\ndestruction and chaos.  Why, suffering is the sole origin of\\nconsciousness.  Though I did lay it down at the beginning that\\nconsciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes\\nit and would not give it up for any satisfaction.  Consciousness, for\\ninstance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four.  Once you\\nhave mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to\\nunderstand.  There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five\\nsenses and plunge into contemplation.  While if you stick to\\nconsciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at\\nleast flog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up.\\nReactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nYou believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed--a\\npalace at which one will not be able to put out one\\'s tongue or make a\\nlong nose on the sly.  And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this\\nedifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one\\ncannot put one\\'s tongue out at it even on the sly.\\n\\nYou see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into\\nit to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a\\npalace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry.  You laugh and say\\nthat in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion.  Yes, I\\nanswer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.\\n\\nBut what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not\\nthe only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live\\nin a mansion?  That is my choice, my desire.  You will only eradicate\\nit when you have changed my preference.  Well, do change it, allure me\\nwith something else, give me another ideal.  But meanwhile I will not\\ntake a hen-house for a mansion.  The palace of crystal may be an idle\\ndream, it may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and\\nthat I have invented it only through my own stupidity, through the\\nold-fashioned irrational habits of my generation.  But what does it\\nmatter to me that it is inconsistent?  That makes no difference since\\nit exists in my desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist.\\nPerhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any\\nmockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry.  I\\nknow, anyway, that I will not be put off with a compromise, with a\\nrecurring zero, simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature\\nand actually exists.  I will not accept as the crown of my desires a\\nblock of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand\\nyears, and perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy\\nmy desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will\\nfollow you.  You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble;\\nbut in that case I can give you the same answer.  We are discussing\\nthings seriously; but if you won\\'t deign to give me your attention, I\\nwill drop your acquaintance.  I can retreat into my underground hole.\\n\\nBut while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were\\nwithered off than bring one brick to such a building!  Don\\'t remind me\\nthat I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason\\nthat one cannot put out one\\'s tongue at it.  I did not say because I am\\nso fond of putting my tongue out.  Perhaps the thing I resented was,\\nthat of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not\\nput out one\\'s tongue.  On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut\\noff out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose\\nall desire to put it out.  It is not my fault that things cannot be so\\narranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats.  Then why am\\nI made with such desires?  Can I have been constructed simply in order\\nto come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat?  Can\\nthis be my whole purpose?  I do not believe it.\\n\\nBut do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to\\nbe kept on a curb.  Though we may sit forty years underground without\\nspeaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we\\ntalk and talk and talk....\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nThe long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do\\nnothing! Better conscious inertia!  And so hurrah for underground!\\nThough I have said that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my\\nbile, yet I should not care to be in his place such as he is now\\n(though I shall not cease envying him).  No, no; anyway the underground\\nlife is more advantageous. There, at any rate, one can ...  Oh, but\\neven now I am lying!  I am lying because I know myself that it is not\\nunderground that is better, but something different, quite different,\\nfor which I am thirsting, but which I cannot find!  Damn underground!\\n\\nI will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I\\nmyself believed in anything of what I have just written.  I swear to\\nyou, gentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have\\nwritten that I really believe.  That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at\\nthe same time I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.\\n\\n\"Then why have you written all this?\" you will say to me.  \"I ought to\\nput you underground for forty years without anything to do and then\\ncome to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached!\\nHow can a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that shameful, isn\\'t that humiliating?\" you will say, perhaps,\\nwagging your heads contemptuously.  \"You thirst for life and try to\\nsettle the problems of life by a logical tangle.  And how persistent,\\nhow insolent are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you\\nare in!  You talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent\\nthings and are in continual alarm and apologising for them.  You\\ndeclare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to\\ningratiate yourself in our good opinion.  You declare that you are\\ngnashing your teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to\\namuse us.  You know that your witticisms are not witty, but you are\\nevidently well satisfied with their literary value.  You may, perhaps,\\nhave really suffered, but you have no respect for your own suffering.\\nYou may have sincerity, but you have no modesty; out of the pettiest\\nvanity you expose your sincerity to publicity and ignominy.  You\\ndoubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last word through\\nfear, because you have not the resolution to utter it, and only have a\\ncowardly impudence.  You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure\\nof your ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is darkened\\nand corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine consciousness without\\na pure heart.  And how intrusive you are, how you insist and grimace!\\nLies, lies, lies!\"\\n\\nOf course I have myself made up all the things you say.  That, too, is\\nfrom underground.  I have been for forty years listening to you through\\na crack under the floor.  I have invented them myself, there was\\nnothing else I could invent.  It is no wonder that I have learned it by\\nheart and it has taken a literary form....\\n\\nBut can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all\\nthis and give it to you to read too?  And another problem: why do I\\ncall you \"gentlemen,\" why do I address you as though you really were my\\nreaders? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor\\ngiven to other people to read.  Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough\\nfor that, and I don\\'t see why I should be.  But you see a fancy has\\noccurred to me and I want to realise it at all costs.  Let me explain.\\n\\nEvery man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but\\nonly to his friends.  He has other matters in his mind which he would\\nnot reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in\\nsecret.  But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even\\nto himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored\\naway in his mind. The more decent he is, the greater the number of such\\nthings in his mind.  Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember\\nsome of my early adventures.  Till now I have always avoided them, even\\nwith a certain uneasiness.  Now, when I am not only recalling them, but\\nhave actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the\\nexperiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and\\nnot take fright at the whole truth.  I will observe, in parenthesis,\\nthat Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility,\\nand that man is bound to lie about himself.  He considers that Rousseau\\ncertainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even\\nintentionally lied, out of vanity.  I am convinced that Heine is right;\\nI quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity,\\nattribute regular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well\\nconceive that kind of vanity.  But Heine judged of people who made\\ntheir confessions to the public.  I write only for myself, and I wish\\nto declare once and for all that if I write as though I were addressing\\nreaders, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that\\nform.  It is a form, an empty form--I shall never have readers.  I have\\nmade this plain already ...\\n\\nI don\\'t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of\\nmy notes.  I shall not attempt any system or method.  I will jot things\\ndown as I remember them.\\n\\nBut here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you\\nreally don\\'t reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with\\nyourself--and on paper too--that is, that you won\\'t attempt any system\\nor method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on,\\nand so on?  Why are you explaining?  Why do you apologise?\\n\\nWell, there it is, I answer.\\n\\nThere is a whole psychology in all this, though.  Perhaps it is simply\\nthat I am a coward.  And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience\\nbefore me in order that I may be more dignified while I write.  There\\nare perhaps thousands of reasons.  Again, what is my object precisely\\nin writing?  If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I\\nnot simply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them\\non paper?\\n\\nQuite so; but yet it  is more imposing on paper.  There is something\\nmore impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and\\nimprove my style.  Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from\\nwriting. Today, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory\\nof a distant past.  It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and\\nhas remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid\\nof. And yet I must get rid of it somehow.  I have hundreds of such\\nreminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and\\noppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I\\nshould get rid of it. Why not try?\\n\\nBesides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do.  Writing will be\\na sort of work.  They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest.\\nWell, here is a chance for me, anyway.\\n\\nSnow is falling today, yellow and dingy.  It fell yesterday, too, and a\\nfew days ago.  I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that\\nincident which I cannot shake off now.  And so let it be a story A\\nPROPOS of the falling snow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II\\n\\nA Propos of the Wet Snow\\n\\n  When from dark error\\'s subjugation\\n  My words of passionate exhortation\\n    Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;\\n  And writhing prone in thine affliction\\n  Thou didst recall with malediction\\n    The vice that had encompassed thee:\\n  And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting\\n    By recollection\\'s torturing flame,\\n  Thou didst reveal the hideous setting\\n    Of thy life\\'s current ere I came:\\n  When suddenly I saw thee sicken,\\n    And weeping, hide thine anguished face,\\n  Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,\\n    At memories of foul disgrace.\\n            NEKRASSOV\\n            (translated by Juliet Soskice).\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nAT THAT TIME I was only twenty-four.  My life was even then gloomy,\\nill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage.  I made friends\\nwith no one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and\\nmore in my hole.  At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and\\nwas perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as\\na queer fellow, but even looked upon me--I always fancied this--with a\\nsort of loathing.  I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except\\nme fancied that he was looked upon with aversion?  One of the clerks\\nhad a most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively\\nvillainous.  I believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with\\nsuch an unsightly countenance.  Another had such a very dirty old\\nuniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity.  Yet not\\none of these gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness--either\\nabout their clothes or their countenance or their character in any way.\\nNeither of them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion;\\nif they had imagined it they would not have minded--so long as their\\nsuperiors did not look at them in that way.  It is clear to me now\\nthat, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for\\nmyself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged\\non loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone.\\nI hated my face, for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even\\nsuspected that there was something base in my expression, and so every\\nday when I turned up at the office I tried to behave as independently\\nas possible, and to assume a lofty expression, so that I might not be\\nsuspected of being abject.  \"My face may be ugly,\" I thought, \"but let\\nit be lofty, expressive, and, above all, EXTREMELY intelligent.\"  But I\\nwas positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my\\ncountenance ever to express those qualities.  And what was worst of\\nall, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite\\nsatisfied if I could have looked intelligent.  In fact, I would even\\nhave put up with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have\\nbeen thought strikingly intelligent.\\n\\nOf course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them\\nall, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them.  In fact,\\nit happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself.\\nIt somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising\\nthem and thinking them superior to myself.  A cultivated and decent man\\ncannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself,\\nand without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments.\\nBut whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes\\nalmost every time I met anyone.  I even made experiments whether I\\ncould face so and so\\'s looking at me, and I was always the first to\\ndrop my eyes.  This worried me to distraction.  I had a sickly dread,\\ntoo, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the\\nconventional in everything external.  I loved to fall into the common\\nrut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in\\nmyself.  But how could I live up to it?  I was morbidly sensitive as a\\nman of our age should be.  They were all stupid, and as like one\\nanother as so many sheep.  Perhaps I was the only one in the office who\\nfancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because\\nI was more highly developed.  But it was not only that I fancied it, it\\nreally was so. I was a coward and a slave.  I say this without the\\nslightest embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward\\nand a slave.  That is his normal condition.  Of that I am firmly\\npersuaded.  He is made and constructed to that very end.  And not only\\nat the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at\\nall times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave.  It is the\\nlaw of nature for all decent people all over the earth.  If anyone of\\nthem happens to be valiant about something, he need not be comforted\\nnor carried away by that; he would show the white feather just the same\\nbefore something else.  That is how it invariably and inevitably ends.\\nOnly donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed\\nup to the wall.  It is not worth while to pay attention to them for\\nthey really are of no consequence.\\n\\nAnother circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no\\none like me and I was unlike anyone else.  \"I am alone and they are\\nEVERYONE,\" I thought--and pondered.\\n\\nFrom that it is evident that I was still a youngster.\\n\\nThe very opposite sometimes happened.  It was loathsome sometimes to go\\nto the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill.\\nBut all at once, A PROPOS of nothing, there would come a phase of\\nscepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and\\nI would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would\\nreproach myself with being ROMANTIC.  At one time I was unwilling to\\nspeak to anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to\\nthe length of contemplating making friends with them.  All my\\nfastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish.  Who\\nknows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had simply been\\naffected, and got out of books.  I have not decided that question even\\nnow.  Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played\\npreference, drank vodka, talked of promotions....  But here let me\\nmake a digression.\\n\\nWe Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish\\ntranscendental \"romantics\"--German, and still more French--on whom\\nnothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France\\nperished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would\\nnot even have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on\\nsinging their transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because\\nthey are fools.  We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known.\\nThat is what distinguishes us from foreign lands.  Consequently these\\ntranscendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form.\\nThe idea that they are is due to our \"realistic\" journalists and\\ncritics of that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle\\nPyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have\\nslandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort\\nas in Germany or France.  On the contrary, the characteristics of our\\n\"romantics\" are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental\\nEuropean type, and no European standard can be applied to them.  (Allow\\nme to make use of this word \"romantic\"--an old-fashioned and much\\nrespected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.)\\nThe characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, TO\\nSEE EVERYTHING AND TO SEE IT OFTEN INCOMPARABLY MORE CLEARLY THAN OUR\\nMOST REALISTIC MINDS SEE IT; to refuse to accept anyone or anything,\\nbut at the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield,\\nfrom policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as\\nrent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),\\nto keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and\\nvolumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve \"the sublime\\nand the beautiful\" inviolate within them to the hour of their death,\\nand to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel\\nwrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of \"the sublime and the\\nbeautiful.\"  Our \"romantic\" is a man of great breadth and the greatest\\nrogue of all our rogues, I assure you....  I can assure you from\\nexperience, indeed.  Of course, that is, if he is intelligent.  But\\nwhat am I saying!  The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant\\nto observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don\\'t\\ncount, and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they\\ndegenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more\\ncomfortably, settled somewhere out there--by preference in Weimar or\\nthe Black Forest.\\n\\nI, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly\\nabuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.\\nAnyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it.  Our romantic would\\nrather go out of his mind--a thing, however, which very rarely\\nhappens--than take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in\\nview; and he is never kicked out.  At most, they would take him to the\\nlunatic asylum as \"the King of Spain\" if he should go very mad.  But it\\nis only the thin, fair people who go out of their minds in Russia.\\nInnumerable \"romantics\" attain later in life to considerable rank in\\nthe service.  Their many-sidedness is remarkable!  And what a faculty\\nthey have for the most contradictory sensations!  I was comforted by\\nthis thought even in those days, and I am of the same opinion now.\\nThat is why there are so many \"broad natures\" among us who never lose\\ntheir ideal even in the depths of degradation; and though they never\\nstir a finger for their ideal, though they are arrant thieves and\\nknaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are\\nextraordinarily honest at heart.  Yes, it is only among us that the\\nmost incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart\\nwithout in the least ceasing to be a rogue.  I repeat, our romantics,\\nfrequently, become such accomplished rascals (I use the term \"rascals\"\\naffectionately), suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical\\nknowledge that their bewildered superiors and the public generally can\\nonly ejaculate in amazement.\\n\\nTheir many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may\\ndevelop into later on, and what the future has in store for us.  It is\\nnot a poor material!  I do not say this from any foolish or boastful\\npatriotism. But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am\\njoking.  Or perhaps it\\'s just the contrary and you are convinced that I\\nreally think so.  Anyway, gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an\\nhonour and a special favour. And do forgive my digression.\\n\\nI did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and\\nsoon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I\\neven gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations.\\nThat, however, only happened to me once.  As a rule, I was always alone.\\n\\nIn the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading.  I tried\\nto stifle all that was continually seething within me by means of\\nexternal impressions.  And the only external means I had was reading.\\nReading, of course, was a great help--exciting me, giving me pleasure\\nand pain.  But at times it bored me fearfully.  One longed for movement\\nin spite of everything, and I plunged all at once into dark,\\nunderground, loathsome vice of the pettiest kind.  My wretched passions\\nwere acute, smarting, from my continual, sickly irritability I had\\nhysterical impulses, with tears and convulsions.  I had no resource\\nexcept reading, that is, there was nothing in my surroundings which I\\ncould respect and which attracted me. I was overwhelmed with\\ndepression, too; I had an hysterical craving for incongruity and for\\ncontrast, and so I took to vice.  I have not said all this to justify\\nmyself....  But, no!  I am lying.  I did want to justify myself.  I\\nmake that little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen.  I don\\'t\\nwant to lie.  I vowed to myself I would not.\\n\\nAnd so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy\\nvice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most\\nloathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse.\\nAlready even then I had my underground world in my soul.  I was\\nfearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognised.  I\\nvisited various obscure haunts.\\n\\nOne night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some\\ngentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out\\nof the window.  At other times I should have felt very much disgusted,\\nbut I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the\\ngentleman thrown out of the window--and I envied him so much that I\\neven went into the tavern and into the billiard-room.  \"Perhaps,\" I\\nthought, \"I\\'ll have a fight, too, and they\\'ll throw me out of the\\nwindow.\"\\n\\nI was not drunk--but what is one to do--depression will drive a man to\\nsuch a pitch of hysteria?  But nothing happened.  It seemed that I was\\nnot even equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away\\nwithout having my fight.\\n\\nAn officer put me in my place from the first moment.\\n\\nI was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up\\nthe way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without\\na word--without a warning or explanation--moved me from where I was\\nstanding to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me.\\nI could have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved\\nme without noticing me.\\n\\nDevil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel--a more\\ndecent, a more LITERARY one, so to speak.  I had been treated like a\\nfly.  This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little\\nfellow.  But the quarrel was in my hands.  I had only to protest and I\\ncertainly would have been thrown out of the window.  But I changed my\\nmind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat.\\n\\nI went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the\\nnext night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more\\nfurtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears\\nin my eyes--but still I did go out again.  Don\\'t imagine, though, it\\nwas cowardice made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a\\ncoward at heart, though I have always been a coward in action.  Don\\'t\\nbe in a hurry to laugh--I assure you I can explain it all.\\n\\nOh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to\\nfight a duel!  But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long\\nextinct!) who preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol\\'s Lieutenant\\nPirogov, appealing to the police.  They did not fight duels and would\\nhave thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly\\nprocedure in any case--and they looked upon the duel altogether as\\nsomething impossible, something free-thinking and French.  But they\\nwere quite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.\\n\\nI did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded\\nvanity.  I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound\\nthrashing and being thrown out of the window; I should have had\\nphysical courage enough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage.\\nWhat I was afraid of was that everyone present, from the insolent\\nmarker down to the lowest little stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy\\ncollar, would jeer at me and fail to understand when I began to protest\\nand to address them in literary language. For of the point of\\nhonour--not of honour, but of the point of honour (POINT\\nD\\'HONNEUR)--one cannot speak among us except in literary language.  You\\ncan\\'t allude to the \"point of honour\" in ordinary language. I was fully\\nconvinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that\\nthey would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the\\nofficer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but\\nwould certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the\\nbilliard-table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the\\nwindow.\\n\\nOf course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that.  I\\noften met that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very\\ncarefully.  I am not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine\\nnot; I judge from certain signs.  But I--I stared at him with spite and\\nhatred and so it went on ... for several years!  My resentment grew\\neven deeper with years.  At first I began making stealthy inquiries\\nabout this officer.  It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no\\none.  But one day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I\\nwas following him at a distance, as though I were tied to him--and so I\\nlearnt his surname.  Another time I followed him to his flat, and for\\nten kopecks learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey,\\nwhether he lived alone or with others, and so on--in fact, everything\\none could learn from a porter.  One morning, though I had never tried\\nmy hand with the pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on\\nthis officer in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy.  I\\nwrote the novel with relish.  I did unmask his villainy, I even\\nexaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily\\nbe recognised, but on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story\\nto the OTETCHESTVENNIYA ZAPISKI.  But at that time such attacks were\\nnot the fashion and my story was not printed.  That was a great\\nvexation to me.\\n\\nSometimes I was positively choked with resentment.  At last I\\ndetermined to challenge my enemy to a duel.  I composed a splendid,\\ncharming letter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting\\nrather plainly at a duel in case of refusal.  The letter was so\\ncomposed that if the officer had had the least understanding of the\\nsublime and the beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my\\nneck and have offered me his friendship.  And how fine that would have\\nbeen!  How we should have got on together!  \"He could have shielded me\\nwith his higher rank, while I could have improved his mind with my\\nculture, and, well ... my ideas, and all sorts of things might have\\nhappened.\"  Only fancy, this was two years after his insult to me, and\\nmy challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all\\nthe ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the\\nanachronism.  But, thank God (to this day I thank the Almighty with\\ntears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to him.  Cold shivers run\\ndown my back when I think of what might have happened if I had sent it.\\n\\nAnd all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of\\ngenius!  A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me.  Sometimes on\\nholidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four\\no\\'clock in the afternoon.  Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a\\nseries of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no\\ndoubt that was just what I wanted.  I used to wriggle along in a most\\nunseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for\\ngenerals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies.\\nAt such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I\\nused to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the\\nwretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my\\nlittle scurrying figure.  This was a regular martyrdom, a continual,\\nintolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant\\nand direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this\\nworld, a nasty, disgusting fly--more intelligent, more highly\\ndeveloped, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course--but a\\nfly that was continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured\\nby everyone. Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to\\nthe Nevsky, I don\\'t know.  I felt simply drawn there at every possible\\nopportunity.\\n\\nAlready then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I\\nspoke in the first chapter.  After my affair with the officer I felt\\neven more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him\\nmost frequently, there I could admire him.  He, too, went there chiefly\\non holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons\\nof high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but\\npeople, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over;\\nhe made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space\\nbefore him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside.  I\\ngloated over my resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made\\nway for him.  It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be\\non an even footing with him.\\n\\n\"Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?\" I kept asking\\nmyself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o\\'clock in the\\nmorning.  \"Why is it you and not he?  There\\'s no regulation about it;\\nthere\\'s no written law.  Let the making way be equal as it usually is\\nwhen refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you\\npass with mutual respect.\"\\n\\nBut that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not\\neven notice my making way for him.  And lo and behold a bright idea\\ndawned upon me!  \"What,\" I thought, \"if I meet him and don\\'t move on\\none side?  What if I don\\'t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up\\nagainst him?  How would that be?\" This audacious idea took such a hold\\non me that it gave me no peace.  I was dreaming of it continually,\\nhorribly, and I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order\\nto picture more vividly how I should do it when I did do it.  I was\\ndelighted.  This intention seemed to me more and more practical and\\npossible.\\n\\n\"Of course I shall not really push him,\" I thought, already more\\ngood-natured in my joy.  \"I will simply not turn aside, will run up\\nagainst him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other--just\\nas much as decency permits.  I will push against him just as much as he\\npushes against me.\"  At last I made up my mind completely.  But my\\npreparations took a great deal of time.  To begin with, when I carried\\nout my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I\\nhad to think of my get-up.  \"In case of emergency, if, for instance,\\nthere were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the\\nmost RECHERCHE: the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all\\nthe literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires\\nrespect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the\\nsociety.\"\\n\\nWith this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought\\nat Tchurkin\\'s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat.  Black gloves\\nseemed to me both more dignified and BON TON than the lemon-coloured\\nones which I had contemplated at first.  \"The colour is too gaudy, it\\nlooks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,\" and I did not take\\nthe lemon-coloured ones.  I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt,\\nwith white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me\\nback.  The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it\\nwas wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of\\nvulgarity.  I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a\\nbeaver one like an officer\\'s.  For this purpose I began visiting the\\nGostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap\\nGerman beaver.  Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look\\nwretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it\\nfor the occasion.  I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive.\\nAfter thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar.\\nThe rest of the money--a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow\\nfrom Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming\\nperson, though grave and judicious.  He never lent money to anyone, but\\nI had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an\\nimportant personage who had got me my berth.  I was horribly worried.\\nTo borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful.  I\\ndid not sleep for two or three nights.  Indeed, I did not sleep well at\\nthat time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else\\na sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing!  Anton Antonitch was\\nsurprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after\\nall lend me the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to\\ntake from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.\\n\\nIn this way everything was at last ready.  The handsome beaver replaced\\nthe mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work.  It\\nwould never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be\\ncarried out skilfully, by degrees.  But I must confess that after many\\nefforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other.  I\\nmade every preparation, I was quite determined--it seemed as though we\\nshould run into one another directly--and before I knew what I was\\ndoing I had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without\\nnoticing me.  I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me\\ndetermination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended\\nin my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last\\ninstant when I was six inches from him my courage failed me.  He very\\ncalmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball.  That\\nnight I was ill again, feverish and delirious.\\n\\nAnd suddenly it ended most happily.  The night before I had made up my\\nmind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with\\nthat object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I\\nwould abandon it all.  Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I\\nunexpectedly made up my mind--I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt,\\nshoulder to shoulder, against one another!  I did not budge an inch and\\npassed him on a perfectly equal footing!  He did not even look round\\nand pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am\\nconvinced of that.  I am convinced of that to this day!  Of course, I\\ngot the worst of it--he was stronger, but that was not the point.  The\\npoint was that I had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I\\nhad not yielded a step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social\\nfooting with him.  I returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for\\neverything.  I was delighted.  I was triumphant and sang Italian arias.\\nOf course, I will not describe to you what happened to me three days\\nlater; if you have read my first chapter you can guess for yourself.\\nThe officer was afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for\\nfourteen years.  What is the dear fellow doing now? Whom is he walking\\nover?\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nBut the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick\\nafterwards.  It was followed by remorse--I tried to drive it away; I\\nfelt too sick.  By degrees, however, I grew used to that too.  I grew\\nused to everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring\\nit.  But I had a means of escape that reconciled everything--that was\\nto find refuge in \"the sublime and the beautiful,\" in dreams, of\\ncourse.  I was a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on\\nend, tucked away in my corner, and you may believe me that at those\\nmoments I had no resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation\\nof his chicken heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat.\\nI suddenly became a hero.  I would not have admitted my six-foot\\nlieutenant even if he had called on me.  I could not even picture him\\nbefore me then.  What were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself\\nwith them--it is hard to say now, but at the time I was satisfied with\\nthem.  Though, indeed, even now, I am to some extent satisfied with\\nthem.  Dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of\\ndissipation; they came with remorse and with tears, with curses and\\ntransports.  There were moments of such positive intoxication, of such\\nhappiness, that there was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on\\nmy honour.  I had faith, hope, love.  I believed blindly at such times\\nthat by some miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would\\nsuddenly open out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable\\nactivity--beneficent, good, and, above all, READY MADE (what sort of\\nactivity I had no idea, but the great thing was that it should be all\\nready for me)--would rise up before me--and I should come out into the\\nlight of day, almost riding a white horse and crowned with laurel.\\nAnything but the foremost place I could not conceive for myself, and\\nfor that very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in\\nreality.  Either to be a hero or to grovel in the mud--there was\\nnothing between.  That was my ruin, for when I was in the mud I\\ncomforted myself with the thought that at other times I was a hero, and\\nthe hero was a cloak for the mud: for an ordinary man it was shameful\\nto defile himself, but a hero was too lofty to be utterly defiled, and\\nso he might defile himself.  It is worth noting that these attacks of\\nthe \"sublime and the beautiful\" visited me even during the period of\\ndissipation and just at the times when I was touching the bottom.  They\\ncame in separate spurts, as though reminding me of themselves, but did\\nnot banish the dissipation by their appearance. On the contrary, they\\nseemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only sufficiently\\npresent to serve as an appetising sauce.  That sauce was made up of\\ncontradictions and sufferings, of agonising inward analysis, and all\\nthese pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a significance\\nto my dissipation--in fact, completely answered the purpose of an\\nappetising sauce.  There was a certain depth of meaning in it.  And I\\ncould hardly have resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct\\ndebauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it.  What\\ncould have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the\\nstreet?  No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all.\\n\\nAnd what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times\\nin those dreams of mine!  in those \"flights into the sublime and the\\nbeautiful\"; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied\\nto anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that\\none did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality;\\nthat would have been superfluous.  Everything, however, passed\\nsatisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of\\nart, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely\\nstolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs\\nand uses.  I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of\\ncourse, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to\\nrecognise my superiority, and I forgave them all.  I was a poet and a\\ngrand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and\\nimmediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed\\nbefore all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not\\nmerely shameful, but had in them much that was \"sublime and beautiful\"\\nsomething in the Manfred style.  Everyone would kiss me and weep (what\\nidiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and\\nhungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against\\nthe obscurantists.  Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would\\nbe declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then\\nthere would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on\\nthe shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred\\nto the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes,\\nand so on, and so on--as though you did not know all about it?  You\\nwill say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into\\npublic after all the tears and transports which I have myself\\nconfessed.  But why is it contemptible?  Can you imagine that I am\\nashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life,\\ngentlemen?  And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no\\nmeans badly composed....  It did not all happen on the shores of Lake\\nComo.  And yet you are right--it really is vulgar and contemptible.\\nAnd most contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify\\nmyself to you.  And even more contemptible than that is my making this\\nremark now.  But that\\'s enough, or there will be no end to it; each\\nstep will be more contemptible than the last....\\n\\nI could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time\\nwithout feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society.  To\\nplunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton\\nAntonitch Syetotchkin.  He was the only permanent acquaintance I have\\nhad in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now.  But I only went\\nto see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached\\nsuch a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my\\nfellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one\\nhuman being, actually existing.  I had to call on Anton Antonitch,\\nhowever, on Tuesday--his at-home day; so I had always to time my\\npassionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a\\nTuesday.\\n\\nThis Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five\\nCorners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a\\nparticularly frugal and sallow appearance.  He had two daughters and\\ntheir aunt, who used to pour out the tea.  Of the daughters one was\\nthirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was\\nawfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling\\ntogether.  The master of the house usually sat in his study on a\\nleather couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman,\\nusually a colleague from our office or some other department.  I never\\nsaw more than two or three visitors there, always the same.  They\\ntalked about the excise duty; about business in the senate, about\\nsalaries, about promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of\\npleasing him, and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside\\nthese people for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without\\nknowing what to say to them or venturing to say a word.  I became\\nstupefied, several times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a\\nsort of paralysis; but this was pleasant and good for me.  On returning\\nhome I deferred for a time my desire to embrace all mankind.\\n\\nI had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old\\nschoolfellow.  I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg,\\nbut I did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them\\nin the street.  I believe I had transferred into the department I was\\nin simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my\\nhateful childhood.  Curses on that school and all those terrible years\\nof penal servitude!  In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon\\nas I got out into the world.  There were two or three left to whom I\\nnodded in the street.  One of them was Simonov, who had in no way been\\ndistinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I\\ndiscovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty\\nI don\\'t even suppose that he was particularly stupid.  I had at one\\ntime spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not\\nlasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over.  He was\\nevidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy,\\nalways afraid that I might take up the same tone again.  I suspected\\nthat he had an aversion for me, but still I went on going to see him,\\nnot being quite certain of it.\\n\\nAnd so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that\\nas it was Thursday Anton Antonitch\\'s door would be closed, I thought of\\nSimonov.  Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man\\ndisliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him.  But as it\\nalways happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,\\nto put myself into a false position, I went in.  It was almost a year\\nsince I had last seen Simonov.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nI found two of my old schoolfellows with him.  They seemed to be\\ndiscussing an important matter.  All of them took scarcely any notice\\nof my entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years.\\nEvidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common\\nfly.  I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all\\nhated me. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack\\nof success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low,\\ngoing about badly dressed and so on--which seemed to them a sign of my\\nincapacity and insignificance.  But I had not expected such contempt.\\nSimonov was positively surprised at my turning up.  Even in old days he\\nhad always seemed surprised at my coming.  All this disconcerted me: I\\nsat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they\\nwere saying.\\n\\nThey were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell\\ndinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of\\ntheirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a\\ndistant province.  This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me\\ntoo.  I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms.  In the\\nlower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody\\nliked.  I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because\\nhe was a pretty and playful boy.  He was always bad at his lessons and\\ngot worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good\\ncertificate, as he had powerful interests.  During his last year at\\nschool he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all\\nof us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us.  He was vulgar\\nin the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even\\nin his swaggering.  In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions\\nof honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled\\nbefore Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered.  And it was not\\nfrom any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he\\nhad been favoured by the gifts of nature.  Moreover, it was, as it\\nwere, an accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard\\nto tact and the social graces.  This last fact particularly infuriated\\nme.  I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his\\nadmiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid,\\nthough he was bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid\\nface (for which I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent\\none), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the\\n\"\\'forties.\" I hated the way in which he used to talk of his future\\nconquests of women (he did not venture to begin his attack upon women\\nuntil he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to\\nthem with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be\\nfighting.  I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened\\nupon Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his\\nschoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as\\nsportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would\\nnot leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was\\nhis DROIT DE SEIGNEUR, and that if the peasants dared to protest he\\nwould have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded\\nrascals.  Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from\\ncompassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they\\nwere applauding such an insect.  I got the better of him on that\\noccasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and\\nso laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really\\ncomplete; the laugh was on his side.  He got the better of me on\\nseveral occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually.\\nI remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him.\\nWhen we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for\\nI was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally.  Afterwards I\\nheard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life\\nhe was leading.  Then there came other rumours--of his successes in the\\nservice. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I\\nsuspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a\\npersonage as insignificant as me.  I saw him once in the theatre, in\\nthe third tier of boxes.  By then he was wearing shoulder-straps.  He\\nwas twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the\\ndaughters of an ancient General.  In three years he had gone off\\nconsiderably, though he was still rather handsome and adroit.  One\\ncould see that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent.  So it\\nwas to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner\\non his departure.  They had kept up with him for those three years,\\nthough privately they did not consider themselves on an equal footing\\nwith him, I am convinced of that.\\n\\nOf Simonov\\'s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German--a\\nlittle fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always\\nderiding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the\\nlower forms--a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most\\nsensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a\\nwretched little coward at heart.  He was one of those worshippers of\\nZverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often\\nborrowed money from him.  Simonov\\'s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a\\nperson in no way remarkable--a tall young fellow, in the army, with a\\ncold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,\\nand was only capable of thinking of promotion.  He was some sort of\\ndistant relation of Zverkov\\'s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him\\na certain importance among us.  He always thought me of no consequence\\nwhatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was\\ntolerable.\\n\\n\"Well, with seven roubles each,\" said Trudolyubov, \"twenty-one roubles\\nbetween the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.\\nZverkov, of course, won\\'t pay.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not, since we are inviting him,\" Simonov decided.\\n\\n\"Can you imagine,\" Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like\\nsome insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General\\'s decorations,\\n\"can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone?  He will accept\\nfrom delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.\"\\n\\n\"Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?\" observed Trudolyubov,\\ntaking notice only of the half dozen.\\n\\n\"So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles,\\nat the Hotel de Paris at five o\\'clock tomorrow,\" Simonov, who had been\\nasked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.\\n\\n\"How twenty-one roubles?\" I asked in some agitation, with a show of\\nbeing offended; \"if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but\\ntwenty-eight roubles.\"\\n\\nIt seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly\\nwould be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at\\nonce and would look at me with respect.\\n\\n\"Do you want to join, too?\" Simonov observed, with no appearance of\\npleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me.  He knew me through and\\nthrough.\\n\\nIt infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.\\n\\n\"Why not?  I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must\\nown I feel hurt that you have left me out,\" I said, boiling over again.\\n\\n\"And where were we to find you?\" Ferfitchkin put in roughly.\\n\\n\"You never were on good terms with Zverkov,\" Trudolyubov added,\\nfrowning.\\n\\nBut I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,\"\\nI retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had\\nhappened. \"Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I\\nhave not always been on good terms with him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s no making you out ... with these refinements,\" Trudolyubov\\njeered.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll put your name down,\" Simonov decided, addressing me. \"Tomorrow\\nat five-o\\'clock at the Hotel de Paris.\"\\n\\n\"What about the money?\" Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating\\nme to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said Trudolyubov, getting up.  \"If he wants to come so\\nmuch, let him.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s a private thing, between us friends,\" Ferfitchkin said\\ncrossly, as he, too, picked up his hat.  \"It\\'s not an official\\ngathering.\"\\n\\n\"We do not want at all, perhaps ...\"\\n\\nThey went away.  Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went\\nout, Trudolyubov barely nodded.  Simonov, with whom I was left\\nTETE-A-TETE, was in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at\\nme queerly. He did not sit down and did not ask me to.\\n\\n\"H\\'m ... yes ... tomorrow, then.  Will you pay your subscription now?\\nI just ask so as to know,\" he muttered in embarrassment.\\n\\nI flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov\\nfifteen roubles for ages--which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though\\nI had not paid it.\\n\\n\"You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came\\nhere....  I am very much vexed that I have forgotten....\"\\n\\n\"All right, all right, that doesn\\'t matter.  You can pay tomorrow after\\nthe dinner.  I simply wanted to know....  Please don\\'t...\"\\n\\nHe broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed.  As he walked\\nhe began to stamp with his heels.\\n\\n\"Am I keeping you?\" I asked, after two minutes of silence.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" he said, starting, \"that is--to be truthful--yes.  I have to go\\nand see someone ... not far from here,\" he added in an apologetic\\nvoice, somewhat abashed.\\n\\n\"My goodness, why didn\\'t you say so?\" I cried, seizing my cap, with an\\nastonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have\\nexpected of myself.\\n\\n\"It\\'s close by ... not two paces away,\" Simonov repeated, accompanying\\nme to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all.\\n\"So five o\\'clock, punctually, tomorrow,\" he called down the stairs\\nafter me. He was very glad to get rid of me.  I was in a fury.\\n\\n\"What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?\" I\\nwondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, \"for a\\nscoundrel, a pig like that Zverkov!  Of course I had better not go; of\\ncourse, I must just snap my fingers at them.  I am not bound in any\\nway.  I\\'ll send Simonov a note by tomorrow\\'s post....\"\\n\\nBut what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,\\nthat I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more\\nunseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.\\n\\nAnd there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money.  All I\\nhad was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant,\\nApollon, for his monthly wages.  That was all I paid him--he had to\\nkeep himself.\\n\\nNot to pay him was impossible, considering his character.  But I will\\ntalk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.\\n\\nHowever, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.\\n\\nThat night I had the most hideous dreams.  No wonder; all the evening I\\nhad been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I\\ncould not shake them off.  I was sent to the school by distant\\nrelations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing\\nsince--they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by\\ntheir reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage\\ndistrust at everyone.  My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and\\nmerciless jibes because I was not like any of them.  But I could not\\nendure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble\\nreadiness with which they gave in to one another.  I hated them from\\nthe first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and\\ndisproportionate pride.  Their coarseness revolted me.  They laughed\\ncynically at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces\\nthey had themselves.  In our school the boys\\' faces seemed in a special\\nway to degenerate and grow stupider.  How many fine-looking boys came\\nto us!  In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I\\nwondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of\\ntheir thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their\\nconversations.  They had no understanding of such essential things,\\nthey took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I\\ncould not help considering them inferior to myself.  It was not wounded\\nvanity that drove me to it, and for God\\'s sake do not thrust upon me\\nyour hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that \"I was only a\\ndreamer,\" while they even then had an understanding of life.  They\\nunderstood nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that\\nthat was what made me most indignant with them.  On the contrary, the\\nmost obvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity\\nand even at that time were accustomed to respect success.  Everything\\nthat was just, but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at\\nheartlessly and shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at\\nsixteen they were already talking about a snug berth.  Of course, a\\ngreat deal of it was due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with\\nwhich they had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood.\\nThey were monstrously depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too,\\nwas superficial and an assumption of cynicism; of course there were\\nglimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity; but even that\\nfreshness was not attractive, and showed itself in a certain\\nrakishness.  I hated them horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any\\nof them.  They repaid me in the same way, and did not conceal their\\naversion for me.  But by then I did not desire their affection: on the\\ncontrary, I continually longed for their humiliation.  To escape from\\ntheir derision I purposely began to make all the progress I could with\\nmy studies and forced my way to the very top. This impressed them.\\nMoreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I had already read\\nbooks none of them could read, and understood things (not forming part\\nof our school curriculum) of which they had not even heard.  They took\\na savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally impressed,\\nespecially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds.  The\\nmockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and strained\\nrelations became permanent between us.  In the end I could not put up\\nwith it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in\\nme. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows;\\nbut somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon\\nended of itself.  Once, indeed, I did have a friend.  But I was already\\na tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I\\ntried to instil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of\\nhim a disdainful and complete break with those surroundings.  I\\nfrightened him with my passionate affection; I reduced him to tears, to\\nhysterics.  He was a simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted\\nhimself to me entirely I began to hate him immediately and repulsed\\nhim--as though all I needed him for was to win a victory over him, to\\nsubjugate him and nothing else.  But I could not subjugate all of them;\\nmy friend was not at all like them either, he was, in fact, a rare\\nexception.  The first thing I did on leaving school was to give up the\\nspecial job for which I had been destined so as to break all ties, to\\ncurse my past and shake the dust from off my feet....  And goodness\\nknows why, after all that, I should go trudging off to Simonov\\'s!\\n\\nEarly next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with\\nexcitement, as though it were all about to happen at once.  But I\\nbelieved that some radical change in my life was coming, and would\\ninevitably come that day.  Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external\\nevent, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical\\nchange in my life were at hand.  I went to the office, however, as\\nusual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready.  The great\\nthing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think\\nI am overjoyed at coming.  But there were thousands of such great\\npoints to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me.  I\\npolished my boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world\\nwould have induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered\\nthat it was more than his duties required of him.  I stole the brushes\\nto clean them from the passage, being careful he should not detect it,\\nfor fear of his contempt.  Then I minutely examined my clothes and\\nthought that everything looked old, worn and threadbare.  I had let\\nmyself get too slovenly.  My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could\\nnot go out to dinner in my uniform.  The worst of it was that on the\\nknee of my trousers was a big yellow stain.  I had a foreboding that\\nthat stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity.  I\\nknew, too, that it was very poor to think so.  \"But this is no time for\\nthinking: now I am in for the real thing,\" I thought, and my heart\\nsank.  I knew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously\\nexaggerating the facts.  But how could I help it?  I could not control\\nmyself and was already shaking with fever.  With despair I pictured to\\nmyself how coldly and disdainfully that \"scoundrel\" Zverkov would meet\\nme; with what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead\\nTrudolyubov would look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect\\nFerfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov;\\nhow completely Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise\\nme for the abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit--and, worst of\\nall, how paltry, UNLITERARY, commonplace it would all be.  Of course,\\nthe best thing would be not to go at all.  But that was most impossible\\nof all: if I feel impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked\\ninto it.  I should have jeered at myself ever afterwards: \"So you\\nfunked it, you funked it, you funked the REAL THING!\" On the contrary,\\nI passionately longed to show all that \"rabble\" that I was by no means\\nsuch a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in\\nthe acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the\\nupper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them like\\nme--if only for my \"elevation of thought and unmistakable wit.\"  They\\nwould abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed,\\nwhile I should crush him.  Then, perhaps, we would be reconciled and\\ndrink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter and\\nhumiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for\\ncertain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not\\nreally want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not\\ncare a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it.  Oh, how\\nI prayed for the day to pass quickly!  In unutterable anguish I went to\\nthe window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled\\ndarkness of the thickly falling wet snow.  At last my wretched little\\nclock hissed out five.  I seized my hat and, trying not to look at\\nApollon, who had been all day expecting his month\\'s wages, but in his\\nfoolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped\\nbetween him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on\\nwhich I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the\\nHotel de Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nI had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.\\nBut it was not a question of being the first to arrive.  Not only were\\nthey not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room.  The table\\nwas not laid even.  What did it mean?  After a good many questions I\\nelicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for\\nfive, but for six o\\'clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too.  I\\nfelt really ashamed to go on questioning them.  It was only twenty-five\\nminutes past five.  If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least\\nto have let me know--that is what the post is for, and not to have put\\nme in an absurd position in my own eyes and ... and even before the\\nwaiters.  I sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even\\nmore humiliated when he was present. Towards six o\\'clock they brought\\nin candles, though there were lamps burning in the room.  It had not\\noccurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I\\narrived.  In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were\\neating their dinners in silence at two different tables.  There was a\\ngreat deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could\\nhear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in\\nFrench: there were ladies at the dinner.  It was sickening, in fact. I\\nrarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did\\narrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as\\nthough they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent\\nupon me to show resentment.\\n\\nZverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading\\nspirit.  He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew\\nhimself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather\\njaunty bend from the waist.  He shook hands with me in a friendly, but\\nnot over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like\\nthat of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off\\nsomething.  I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would\\nat once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making\\nhis insipid jokes and witticisms.  I had been preparing for them ever\\nsince the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such\\nhigh-official courtesy.  So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior\\nto me in every respect!  If he only meant to insult me by that\\nhigh-official tone, it would not matter, I thought--I could pay him\\nback for it one way or another.  But what if, in reality, without the\\nleast desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest\\nthat he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising\\nway?  The very supposition made me gasp.\\n\\n\"I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,\" he began, lisping\\nand drawling, which was something new.  \"You and I seem to have seen\\nnothing of one another.  You fight shy of us.  You shouldn\\'t.  We are\\nnot such terrible people as you think.  Well, anyway, I am glad to\\nrenew our acquaintance.\"\\n\\nAnd he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.\\n\\n\"Have you been waiting long?\" Trudolyubov inquired.\\n\\n\"I arrived at five o\\'clock as you told me yesterday,\" I answered aloud,\\nwith an irritability that threatened an explosion.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you let him know that we had changed the hour?\" said\\nTrudolyubov to Simonov.\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t.  I forgot,\" the latter replied, with no sign of regret,\\nand without even apologising to me he went off to order the HORS\\nD\\'OEUVRE.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ve been here a whole hour?  Oh, poor fellow!\" Zverkov cried\\nironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.\\nThat rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a\\npuppy yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous\\nand embarrassing.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t funny at all!\" I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more\\nirritated. \"It wasn\\'t my fault, but other people\\'s.  They neglected to\\nlet me know.  It was ... it was ... it was simply absurd.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not only absurd, but something else as well,\" muttered\\nTrudolyubov, naively taking my part.  \"You are not hard enough upon it.\\nIt was simply rudeness--unintentional, of course.  And how could\\nSimonov ... h\\'m!\"\\n\\n\"If a trick like that had been played on me,\" observed Ferfitchkin, \"I\\nshould ...\"\\n\\n\"But you should have ordered something for yourself,\" Zverkov\\ninterrupted, \"or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.\"\\n\\n\"You will allow that I might have done that without your permission,\" I\\nrapped out.  \"If I waited, it was ...\"\\n\\n\"Let us sit down, gentlemen,\" cried Simonov, coming in.  \"Everything is\\nready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen....  You\\nsee, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?\" he\\nsuddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.\\nEvidently he had something against me.  It must have been what happened\\nyesterday.\\n\\nAll sat down; I did the same.  It was a round table.  Trudolyubov was\\non my left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite,\\nFerfitchkin next to him, between him and Trudolyubov.\\n\\n\"Tell me, are you ... in a government office?\" Zverkov went on\\nattending to me.  Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought\\nthat he ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.\\n\\n\"Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?\" I thought, in a fury.\\nIn my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.\\n\\n\"In the N---- office,\" I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.\\n\\n\"And ha-ave you a go-od berth?  I say, what ma-a-de you leave your\\noriginal job?\"\\n\\n\"What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,\" I drawled\\nmore than he, hardly able to control myself.  Ferfitchkin went off into\\na guffaw.  Simonov looked at me ironically.  Trudolyubov left off\\neating and began looking at me with curiosity.\\n\\nZverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.\\n\\n\"And the remuneration?\"\\n\\n\"What remuneration?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, your sa-a-lary?\"\\n\\n\"Why are you cross-examining me?\" However, I told him at once what my\\nsalary was.  I turned horribly red.\\n\\n\"It is not very handsome,\" Zverkov observed majestically.\\n\\n\"Yes, you can\\'t afford to dine at cafes on that,\" Ferfitchkin added\\ninsolently.\\n\\n\"To my thinking it\\'s very poor,\" Trudolyubov observed gravely.\\n\\n\"And how thin you have grown!  How you have changed!\" added Zverkov,\\nwith a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a\\nsort of insolent compassion.\\n\\n\"Oh, spare his blushes,\" cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.\\n\\n\"My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,\" I broke out at\\nlast; \"do you hear?  I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense,\\nnot at other people\\'s--note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.\"\\n\\n\"Wha-at?  Isn\\'t every one here dining at his own expense?  You would\\nseem to be ...\"  Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a\\nlobster, and looking me in the face with fury.\\n\\n\"Tha-at,\" I answered, feeling I had gone too far, \"and I imagine it\\nwould be better to talk of something more intelligent.\"\\n\\n\"You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.\"\\n\\n\"Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh?  Have you gone\\nout of your wits in your office?\"\\n\\n\"Enough, gentlemen, enough!\" Zverkov cried, authoritatively.\\n\\n\"How stupid it is!\" muttered Simonov.\\n\\n\"It really is stupid.  We have met here, a company of friends, for a\\nfarewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation,\" said\\nTrudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone.  \"You invited\\nyourself to join us, so don\\'t disturb the general harmony.\"\\n\\n\"Enough, enough!\" cried Zverkov.  \"Give over, gentlemen, it\\'s out of\\nplace.  Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before\\nyesterday....\"\\n\\nAnd then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had\\nalmost been married two days before.  There was not a word about the\\nmarriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels\\nand kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them.  It\\nwas greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.\\n\\nNo one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.\\n\\n\"Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!\" I thought.  \"And what\\na fool I have made of myself before them!  I let Ferfitchkin go too\\nfar, though.  The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting\\nme sit down with them.  They don\\'t understand that it\\'s an honour to\\nthem and not to me!  I\\'ve grown thinner!  My clothes!  Oh, damn my\\ntrousers! Zverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he\\ncame in....  But what\\'s the use!  I must get up at once, this very\\nminute, take my hat and simply go without a word ... with contempt!\\nAnd tomorrow I can send a challenge.  The scoundrels!  As though I\\ncared about the seven roubles.  They may think....  Damn it!  I don\\'t\\ncare about the seven roubles.  I\\'ll go this minute!\"\\n\\nOf course I remained.  I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my\\ndiscomfiture.  Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected.  My\\nannoyance increased as the wine went to my head.  I longed all at once\\nto insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away.  To\\nseize the moment and show what I could do, so that they would say,\\n\"He\\'s clever, though he is absurd,\" and ... and ... in fact, damn them\\nall!\\n\\nI scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes.  But they seemed to\\nhave forgotten me altogether.  They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful.\\nZverkov was talking all the time.  I began listening.  Zverkov was\\ntalking of some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring\\nher love (of course, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been\\nhelped in this affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an\\nofficer in the hussars, who had three thousand serfs.\\n\\n\"And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an\\nappearance here tonight to see you off,\" I cut in suddenly.\\n\\nFor one minute every one was silent.  \"You are drunk already.\"\\nTrudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my\\ndirection.  Zverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an\\ninsect. I dropped my eyes.  Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses\\nwith champagne.\\n\\nTrudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.\\n\\n\"Your health and good luck on the journey!\" he cried to Zverkov.  \"To\\nold times, to our future, hurrah!\"\\n\\nThey all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss\\nhim.  I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.\\n\\n\"Why, aren\\'t you going to drink it?\" roared Trudolyubov, losing\\npatience and turning menacingly to me.\\n\\n\"I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then\\nI\\'ll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.\"\\n\\n\"Spiteful brute!\" muttered Simonov.  I drew myself up in my chair and\\nfeverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary,\\nthough I did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.\\n\\n\"SILENCE!\" cried Ferfitchkin.  \"Now for a display of wit!\"\\n\\nZverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.\\n\\n\"Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov,\" I began, \"let me tell you that I hate\\nphrases, phrasemongers and men in corsets ... that\\'s the first point,\\nand there is a second one to follow it.\"\\n\\nThere was a general stir.\\n\\n\"The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers.  Especially\\nribald talkers!  The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty.\"\\nI went on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with\\nhorror myself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this.  \"I\\nlove thought, Monsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal\\nfooting and not ... H\\'m ... I love ... But, however, why not?  I will\\ndrink your health, too, Mr. Zverkov.  Seduce the Circassian girls,\\nshoot the enemies of the fatherland and ... and ... to your health,\\nMonsieur Zverkov!\"\\n\\nZverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:\\n\\n\"I am very much obliged to you.\"  He was frightfully offended and\\nturned pale.\\n\\n\"Damn the fellow!\" roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the\\ntable.\\n\\n\"Well, he wants a punch in the face for that,\" squealed Ferfitchkin.\\n\\n\"We ought to turn him out,\" muttered Simonov.\\n\\n\"Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!\" cried Zverkov solemnly,\\nchecking the general indignation.  \"I thank you all, but I can show him\\nfor myself how much value I attach to his words.\"\\n\\n\"Mr.  Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your\\nwords just now!\" I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.\\n\\n\"A duel, you mean?  Certainly,\" he answered.  But probably I was so\\nridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my\\nappearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with\\nlaughter.\\n\\n\"Yes, let him alone, of course!  He is quite drunk,\" Trudolyubov said\\nwith disgust.\\n\\n\"I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,\" Simonov\\nmuttered again.\\n\\n\"Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,\" I thought to\\nmyself. I picked up the bottle ... and filled my glass....  \"No, I\\'d\\nbetter sit on to the end,\" I went on thinking; \"you would be pleased,\\nmy friends, if I went away.  Nothing will induce me to go.  I\\'ll go on\\nsitting here and drinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I\\ndon\\'t think you of the slightest consequence.  I will go on sitting and\\ndrinking, because this is a public-house and I paid my entrance money.\\nI\\'ll sit here and drink, for I look upon you as so many pawns, as\\ninanimate pawns.  I\\'ll sit here and drink ... and sing if I want to,\\nyes, sing, for I have the right to ... to sing ...  H\\'m!\"\\n\\nBut I did not sing.  I simply tried not to look at any of them.  I\\nassumed most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them\\nto speak FIRST.  But alas, they did not address me!  And oh, how I\\nwished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them!  It\\nstruck eight, at last nine.  They moved from the table to the sofa.\\nZverkov stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round\\ntable.  Wine was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three bottles\\non his own account.  I, of course, was not invited to join them.  They\\nall sat round him on the sofa.  They listened to him, almost with\\nreverence.  It was evident that they were fond of him.  \"What for?\\nWhat for?\" I wondered.  From time to time they were moved to drunken\\nenthusiasm and kissed each other.  They talked of the Caucasus, of the\\nnature of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of the income of\\nan hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and\\nrejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace and beauty\\nof a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to\\nShakespeare\\'s being immortal.\\n\\nI smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the\\nroom, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again.  I\\ntried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet\\nI purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels.  But it\\nwas all in vain.  They paid no attention.  I had the patience to walk\\nup and down in front of them from eight o\\'clock till eleven, in the\\nsame place, from the table to the stove and back again.  \"I walk up and\\ndown to please myself and no one can prevent me.\"  The waiter who came\\ninto the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me.  I was\\nsomewhat giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me\\nthat I was in delirium.  During those three hours I was three times\\nsoaked with sweat and dry again.  At times, with an intense, acute pang\\nI was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years,\\nforty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember\\nwith loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most\\nawful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to\\ndegrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and\\nyet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove.  \"Oh, if\\nyou only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured\\nI am!\" I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my\\nenemies were sitting.  But my enemies behaved as though I were not in\\nthe room.  Once--only once--they turned towards me, just when Zverkov\\nwas talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous\\nlaugh.  I laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all\\nat once broke off their conversation, and silently and gravely for two\\nminutes watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove,\\nTAKING NO NOTICE OF THEM.  But nothing came of it: they said nothing,\\nand two minutes later they ceased to notice me again.  It struck eleven.\\n\\n\"Friends,\" cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, \"let us all be off\\nnow, THERE!\"\\n\\n\"Of course, of course,\" the others assented.  I turned sharply to\\nZverkov.  I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my\\nthroat to put an end to it.  I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with\\nperspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples.\\n\\n\"Zverkov, I beg your pardon,\" I said abruptly and resolutely.\\n\"Ferfitchkin, yours too, and everyone\\'s, everyone\\'s: I have insulted\\nyou all!\"\\n\\n\"Aha!  A duel is not in your line, old man,\" Ferfitchkin hissed\\nvenomously.\\n\\nIt sent a sharp pang to my heart.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin!  I am ready to\\nfight you tomorrow, after we are reconciled.  I insist upon it, in\\nfact, and you cannot refuse.  I want to show you that I am not afraid\\nof a duel.  You shall fire first and I shall fire into the air.\"\\n\\n\"He is comforting himself,\" said Simonov.\\n\\n\"He\\'s simply raving,\" said Trudolyubov.\\n\\n\"But let us pass.  Why are you barring our way?  What do you want?\"\\nZverkov answered disdainfully.\\n\\nThey were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been drinking\\nheavily.\\n\\n\"I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but ...\"\\n\\n\"Insulted?  YOU insulted ME?  Understand, sir, that you never, under\\nany circumstances, could possibly insult ME.\"\\n\\n\"And that\\'s enough for you.  Out of the way!\" concluded Trudolyubov.\\n\\n\"Olympia is mine, friends, that\\'s agreed!\" cried Zverkov.\\n\\n\"We won\\'t dispute your right, we won\\'t dispute your right,\" the others\\nanswered, laughing.\\n\\nI stood as though spat upon.  The party went noisily out of the room.\\nTrudolyubov struck up some stupid song.  Simonov remained behind for a\\nmoment to tip the waiters.  I suddenly went up to him.\\n\\n\"Simonov!  give me six roubles!\" I said, with desperate resolution.\\n\\nHe looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes.   He, too, was\\ndrunk.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mean you are coming with us?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no money,\" he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out\\nof the room.\\n\\nI clutched at his overcoat.  It was a nightmare.\\n\\n\"Simonov, I saw you had money.  Why do you refuse me?  Am I a\\nscoundrel?  Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am\\nasking!  My whole future, my whole plans depend upon it!\"\\n\\nSimonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.\\n\\n\"Take it, if you have no sense of shame!\" he pronounced pitilessly, and\\nran to overtake them.\\n\\nI was left for a moment alone.  Disorder, the remains of dinner, a\\nbroken wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of\\ndrink and delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and\\nfinally the waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking\\ninquisitively into my face.\\n\\n\"I am going there!\" I cried.  \"Either they shall all go down on their\\nknees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the\\nface!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\"So this is it, this is it at last--contact with real life,\" I muttered\\nas I ran headlong downstairs.  \"This is very different from the Pope\\'s\\nleaving Rome and going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake\\nComo!\"\\n\\n\"You are a scoundrel,\" a thought flashed through my mind, \"if you laugh\\nat this now.\"\\n\\n\"No matter!\" I cried, answering myself.  \"Now everything is lost!\"\\n\\nThere was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference--I\\nknew where they had gone.\\n\\nAt the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough\\npeasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were\\nwarm, snow.  It was hot and steamy.  The little shaggy piebald horse\\nwas also covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well.  I\\nmade a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my\\nfoot to get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me\\nsix roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a\\nsack.\\n\\n\"No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,\" I cried.  \"But I\\nwill make up for it or perish on the spot this very night.  Start!\"\\n\\nWe set off.  There was a perfect whirl in my head.\\n\\n\"They won\\'t go down on their knees to beg for my friendship.  That is a\\nmirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical--that\\'s\\nanother ball on Lake Como.  And so I am bound to slap Zverkov\\'s face!\\nIt is my duty to.  And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap\\nin the face. Hurry up!\"\\n\\nThe driver tugged at the reins.\\n\\n\"As soon as I go in I\\'ll give it him.  Ought I before giving him the\\nslap to say a few words by way of preface?  No. I\\'ll simply go in and\\ngive it him. They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with\\nOlympia on the sofa.  That damned Olympia!  She laughed at my looks on\\none occasion and refused me.  I\\'ll pull Olympia\\'s hair, pull Zverkov\\'s\\nears!  No, better one ear, and pull him by it round the room.  Maybe\\nthey will all begin beating me and will kick me out.  That\\'s most\\nlikely, indeed.  No matter! Anyway, I shall first slap him; the\\ninitiative will be mine; and by the laws of honour that is everything:\\nhe will be branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows, by\\nnothing but a duel.  He will be forced to fight.  And let them beat me\\nnow.  Let them, the ungrateful wretches!  Trudolyubov will beat me\\nhardest, he is so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold\\nsideways and tug at my hair.  But no matter, no matter!  That\\'s what I\\nam going for.  The blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy\\nof it all! When they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that\\nin reality they are not worth my little finger.  Get on, driver, get\\non!\" I cried to the driver. He started and flicked his whip, I shouted\\nso savagely.\\n\\n\"We shall fight at daybreak, that\\'s a settled thing.  I\\'ve done with\\nthe office.  Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now.  But where can\\nI get pistols?  Nonsense!  I\\'ll get my salary in advance and buy them.\\nAnd powder, and bullets?  That\\'s the second\\'s business.  And how can it\\nall be done by daybreak?  and where am I to get a second?  I have no\\nfriends. Nonsense!\" I cried, lashing myself up more and more.  \"It\\'s of\\nno consequence! The first person I meet in the street is bound to be my\\nsecond, just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water.\\nThe most eccentric things may happen.  Even if I were to ask the\\ndirector himself to be my second tomorrow, he would be bound to\\nconsent, if only from a feeling of chivalry, and to keep the secret!\\nAnton Antonitch....\"\\n\\nThe fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my\\nplan and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to\\nmy imagination than it could be to anyone on earth.  But ....\\n\\n\"Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!\"\\n\\n\"Ugh, sir!\" said the son of toil.\\n\\nCold shivers suddenly ran down me.  Wouldn\\'t it be better ... to go\\nstraight home?  My God, my God!  Why did I invite myself to this dinner\\nyesterday?  But no, it\\'s impossible.  And my walking up and down for\\nthree hours from the table to the stove?  No, they, they and no one\\nelse must pay for my walking up and down!  They must wipe out this\\ndishonour! Drive on!\\n\\nAnd what if they give me into custody?  They won\\'t dare!  They\\'ll be\\nafraid of the scandal.  And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he\\nrefuses to fight a duel?  He is sure to; but in that case I\\'ll show\\nthem ... I will turn up at the posting station when he\\'s setting off\\ntomorrow, I\\'ll catch him by the leg, I\\'ll pull off his coat when he\\ngets into the carriage. I\\'ll get my teeth into his hand, I\\'ll bite him.\\n\"See what lengths you can drive a desperate man to!\" He may hit me on\\nthe head and they may belabour me from behind.  I will shout to the\\nassembled multitude: \"Look at this young puppy who is driving off to\\ncaptivate the Circassian girls after letting me spit in his face!\"\\n\\nOf course, after that everything will be over!  The office will have\\nvanished off the face of the earth.  I shall be arrested, I shall be\\ntried, I shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to\\nSiberia. Never mind!  In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I\\nwill trudge off to him, a beggar, in rags.  I shall find him in some\\nprovincial town.  He will be married and happy.  He will have a\\ngrown-up daughter.... I shall say to him: \"Look, monster, at my hollow\\ncheeks and my rags!  I\\'ve lost everything--my career, my happiness,\\nart, science, THE WOMAN I LOVED, and all through you.  Here are\\npistols.  I have come to discharge my pistol and ... and I ... forgive\\nyou.  Then I shall fire into the air and he will hear nothing more of\\nme....\"\\n\\nI was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at\\nthat moment that all this was out of Pushkin\\'s SILVIO and Lermontov\\'s\\nMASQUERADE. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I\\nstopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow\\nin the middle of the street.  The driver gazed at me, sighing and\\nastonished.\\n\\nWhat was I to do?  I could not go on there--it was evidently stupid,\\nand I could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as\\nthough ... Heavens, how could I leave things!  And after such insults!\\n\"No!\" I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again.  \"It is ordained!\\nIt is fate!  Drive on, drive on!\"\\n\\nAnd in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the\\nneck.\\n\\n\"What are you up to?  What are you hitting me for?\" the peasant\\nshouted, but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.\\n\\nThe wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless\\nof it.  I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the\\nslap, and felt with horror that it was going to happen NOW, AT ONCE,\\nand that NO FORCE COULD STOP IT.  The deserted street lamps gleamed\\nsullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral.  The snow\\ndrifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted\\nthere.  I did not wrap myself up--all was lost, anyway.\\n\\nAt last we arrived.  I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps\\nand began knocking and kicking at the door.  I felt fearfully weak,\\nparticularly in my legs and knees.  The door was opened quickly as\\nthough they knew I was coming.  As a fact, Simonov had warned them that\\nperhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which\\none had to give notice and to observe certain precautions.  It was one\\nof those \"millinery establishments\" which were abolished by the police\\na good time ago.  By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had\\nan introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.\\n\\nI walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room,\\nwhere there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement:\\nthere was no one there.  \"Where are they?\" I asked somebody. But by\\nnow, of course, they had separated.  Before me was standing a person\\nwith a stupid smile, the \"madam\" herself, who had seen me before.  A\\nminute later a door opened and another person came in.\\n\\nTaking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I\\ntalked to myself.  I felt as though I had been saved from death and was\\nconscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I\\nshould certainly, certainly have given it!  But now they were not here\\nand ... everything had vanished and changed!  I looked round.  I could\\nnot realise my condition yet.  I looked mechanically at the girl who\\nhad come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face,\\nwith straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering,\\neyes that attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been\\nsmiling.  I began looking at her more intently and, as it were, with\\neffort.  I had not fully collected my thoughts.  There was something\\nsimple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave.  I\\nam sure that this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had\\nnoticed her.  She could not, however, have been called a beauty, though\\nshe was tall, strong-looking, and well built.  She was very simply\\ndressed.  Something loathsome stirred within me.  I went straight up to\\nher.\\n\\nI chanced to look into the glass.  My harassed face struck me as\\nrevolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair.\\n\"No matter, I am glad of it,\" I thought; \"I am glad that I shall seem\\nrepulsive to her; I like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n...  Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though\\noppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it.  After an\\nunnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as\\nit were unexpectedly rapid, chime--as though someone were suddenly\\njumping forward.  It struck two.  I woke up, though I had indeed not\\nbeen asleep but lying half-conscious.\\n\\nIt was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room,\\ncumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and\\nall sorts of frippery and litter.  The candle end that had been burning\\non the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time.\\nIn a few minutes there would be complete darkness.\\n\\nI was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at\\nonce, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon\\nme again.  And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed\\ncontinually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams\\nmoved drearily.  But strange to say, everything that had happened to me\\nin that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away\\npast, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.\\n\\nMy head was full of fumes.  Something seemed to be hovering over me,\\nrousing me, exciting me, and making me restless.  Misery and spite\\nseemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet.  Suddenly I saw\\nbeside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and\\npersistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it\\nwere utterly remote; it weighed upon me.\\n\\nA grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a\\nhorrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and\\nmouldy cellar.  There was something unnatural in those two eyes,\\nbeginning to look at me only now.  I recalled, too, that during those\\ntwo hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in\\nfact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for\\nsome reason gratified me.  Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous\\nidea--revolting as a spider--of vice, which, without love, grossly and\\nshamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation.\\nFor a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop\\nher eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last\\nI felt uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.\\n\\n\"Liza,\" she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from\\ngraciously, and she turned her eyes away.\\n\\nI was silent.\\n\\n\"What weather!  The snow ... it\\'s disgusting!\" I said, almost to\\nmyself, putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the\\nceiling.\\n\\nShe made no answer.  This was horrible.\\n\\n\"Have you always lived in Petersburg?\" I asked a minute later, almost\\nangrily, turning my head slightly towards her.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Where do you come from?\"\\n\\n\"From Riga,\" she answered reluctantly.\\n\\n\"Are you a German?\"\\n\\n\"No, Russian.\"\\n\\n\"Have you been here long?\"\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\"In this house?\"\\n\\n\"A fortnight.\"\\n\\nShe spoke more and more jerkily.  The candle went out; I could no\\nlonger distinguish her face.\\n\\n\"Have you a father and mother?\"\\n\\n\"Yes ... no ... I have.\"\\n\\n\"Where are they?\"\\n\\n\"There ... in Riga.\"\\n\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing?  Why, what class are they?\"\\n\\n\"Tradespeople.\"\\n\\n\"Have you always lived with them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you leave them?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, for no reason.\"\\n\\nThat answer meant \"Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.\"\\n\\nWe were silent.\\n\\nGod knows why I did not go away.  I felt myself more and more sick and\\ndreary.  The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from\\nmy will, flitting through my memory in confusion.  I suddenly recalled\\nsomething I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was\\nhurrying to the office.\\n\\n\"I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped\\nit,\" I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the\\nconversation, but as it were by accident.\\n\\n\"A coffin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.\"\\n\\n\"From a cellar?\"\\n\\n\"Not from a cellar, but a basement.  Oh, you know ... down below ...\\nfrom a house of ill-fame.  It was filthy all round ...  Egg-shells,\\nlitter ... a stench.  It was loathsome.\"\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\n\"A nasty day to be buried,\" I began, simply to avoid being silent.\\n\\n\"Nasty, in what way?\"\\n\\n\"The snow, the wet.\"  (I yawned.)\\n\\n\"It makes no difference,\" she said suddenly, after a brief silence.\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s horrid.\"  (I yawned again).  \"The gravediggers must have\\nsworn at getting drenched by the snow.  And there must have been water\\nin the grave.\"\\n\\n\"Why water in the grave?\" she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but\\nspeaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.\\n\\nI suddenly began to feel provoked.\\n\\n\"Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep.  You can\\'t\\ndig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Why?  Why, the place is waterlogged.  It\\'s a regular marsh.  So they\\nbury them in water.  I\\'ve seen it myself ... many times.\"\\n\\n(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had\\nonly heard stories of it.)\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say, you don\\'t mind how you die?\"\\n\\n\"But why should I die?\" she answered, as though defending herself.\\n\\n\"Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that\\ndead woman.  She was ... a girl like you.  She died of consumption.\"\\n\\n\"A wench would have died in hospital ...\"  (She knows all about it\\nalready: she said \"wench,\" not \"girl.\")\\n\\n\"She was in debt to her madam,\" I retorted, more and more provoked by\\nthe discussion; \"and went on earning money for her up to the end,\\nthough she was in consumption.  Some sledge-drivers standing by were\\ntalking about her to some soldiers and telling them so.  No doubt they\\nknew her.  They were laughing.  They were going to meet in a pot-house\\nto drink to her memory.\"\\n\\nA great deal of this was my invention.  Silence followed, profound\\nsilence.  She did not stir.\\n\\n\"And is it better to die in a hospital?\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it just the same?  Besides, why should I die?\" she added\\nirritably.\\n\\n\"If not now, a little later.\"\\n\\n\"Why a little later?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed?  Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high\\nprice.  But after another year of this life you will be very\\ndifferent--you will go off.\"\\n\\n\"In a year?\"\\n\\n\"Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,\" I continued malignantly.\\n\"You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year\\nlater--to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to\\na basement in the Haymarket.  That will be if you were lucky.  But it\\nwould be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and\\ncaught a chill, or something or other.  It\\'s not easy to get over an\\nillness in your way of life.  If you catch anything you may not get rid\\nof it.  And so you would die.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, then I shall die,\" she answered, quite vindictively, and she\\nmade a quick movement.\\n\\n\"But one is sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry for whom?\"\\n\\n\"Sorry for life.\" Silence.\\n\\n\"Have you been engaged to be married?  Eh?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that to you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I am not cross-examining you.  It\\'s nothing to me.  Why are you so\\ncross?  Of course you may have had your own troubles.  What is it to\\nme?  It\\'s simply that I felt sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry for whom?\"\\n\\n\"Sorry for you.\"\\n\\n\"No need,\" she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint\\nmovement.\\n\\nThat incensed me at once.  What!  I was so gentle with her, and she....\\n\\n\"Why, do you think that you are on the right path?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think anything.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what\\'s wrong, that you don\\'t think.  Realise it while there is\\nstill time.  There still is time.  You are still young, good-looking;\\nyou might love, be married, be happy....\"\\n\\n\"Not all married women are happy,\" she snapped out in the rude abrupt\\ntone she had used at first.\\n\\n\"Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here.\\nInfinitely better.  Besides, with love one can live even without\\nhappiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one\\nlives.  But here what is there but ... foulness?  Phew!\"\\n\\nI turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly.  I began\\nto feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject.  I was\\nalready longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my\\ncorner. Something suddenly flared up in me.  An object had appeared\\nbefore me.\\n\\n\"Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you.  I am, perhaps,\\nworse than you are.  I was drunk when I came here, though,\" I hastened,\\nhowever, to say in self-defence.  \"Besides, a man is no example for a\\nwoman.  It\\'s a different thing.  I may degrade and defile myself, but I\\nam not anyone\\'s slave.  I come and go, and that\\'s an end of it.  I\\nshake it off, and I am a different man.  But you are a slave from the\\nstart.  Yes, a slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom.  If\\nyou want to break your chains afterwards, you won\\'t be able to; you\\nwill be more and more fast in the snares.  It is an accursed bondage.\\nI know it.  I won\\'t speak of anything else, maybe you won\\'t understand,\\nbut tell me: no doubt you are in debt to your madam?  There, you see,\"\\nI added, though she made no answer, but only listened in silence,\\nentirely absorbed, \"that\\'s a bondage for you! You will never buy your\\nfreedom.  They will see to that.  It\\'s like selling your soul to the\\ndevil....  And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky--how do\\nyou know--and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery?  You know,\\nmen take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief.  Come,\\ntell me, what is there good here?  Here you and I ... came together ...\\njust now and did not say one word to one another all the time, and it\\nwas only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature, and I\\nat you.  Is that loving?  Is that how one human being should meet\\nanother?  It\\'s hideous, that\\'s what it is!\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" she assented sharply and hurriedly.\\n\\nI was positively astounded by the promptitude of this \"Yes.\"  So the\\nsame thought may have been straying through her mind when she was\\nstaring at me just before.  So she, too, was capable of certain\\nthoughts? \"Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of\\nlikeness!\" I thought, almost rubbing my hands.  And indeed it\\'s easy to\\nturn a young soul like that!\\n\\nIt was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.\\n\\nShe turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness\\nthat she propped herself on her arm.  Perhaps she was scrutinising me.\\nHow I regretted that I could not see her eyes.  I heard her deep\\nbreathing.\\n\\n\"Why have you come here?\" I asked her, with a note of authority already\\nin my voice.\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"But how nice it would be to be living in your father\\'s house!  It\\'s\\nwarm and free; you have a home of your own.\"\\n\\n\"But what if it\\'s worse than this?\"\\n\\n\"I must take the right tone,\" flashed through my mind.  \"I may not get\\nfar with sentimentality.\"  But it was only a momentary thought.  I\\nswear she really did interest me.  Besides, I was exhausted and moody.\\nAnd cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.\\n\\n\"Who denies it!\" I hastened to answer.  \"Anything may happen.  I am\\nconvinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned\\nagainst than sinning.  Of course, I know nothing of your story, but\\nit\\'s not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination....\"\\n\\n\"A girl like me?\" she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.\\n\\nDamn it all, I was flattering her.  That was horrid.  But perhaps it\\nwas a good thing....  She was silent.\\n\\n\"See, Liza, I will tell you about myself.  If I had had a home from\\nchildhood, I shouldn\\'t be what I am now.  I often think that.  However\\nbad it may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not\\nenemies, strangers.  Once a year at least, they\\'ll show their love of\\nyou. Anyway, you know you are at home.  I grew up without a home; and\\nperhaps that\\'s why I\\'ve turned so ... unfeeling.\"\\n\\nI waited again.  \"Perhaps she doesn\\'t understand,\" I thought, \"and,\\nindeed, it is absurd--it\\'s moralising.\"\\n\\n\"If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my\\ndaughter more than my sons, really,\" I began indirectly, as though\\ntalking of something else, to distract her attention.  I must confess I\\nblushed.\\n\\n\"Why so?\" she asked.\\n\\nAh! so she was listening!\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Liza.  I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but\\nused to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands,\\nher feet, he couldn\\'t make enough of her, really.  When she danced at\\nparties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her.\\nHe was mad over her: I understand that!  She would fall asleep tired at\\nnight, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of\\nthe cross over her.  He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was\\nstingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving\\nher expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was\\npleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more\\nthan the mothers do.  Some girls live happily at home!  And I believe I\\nshould never let my daughters marry.\"\\n\\n\"What next?\" she said, with a faint smile.\\n\\n\"I should be jealous, I really should.  To think that she should kiss\\nanyone else!  That she should love a stranger more than her father!\\nIt\\'s painful to imagine it.  Of course, that\\'s all nonsense, of course\\nevery father would be reasonable at last.  But I believe before I\\nshould let her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find\\nfault with all her suitors.  But I should end by letting her marry whom\\nshe herself loved. The one whom the daughter loves always seems the\\nworst to the father, you know.  That is always so.  So many family\\ntroubles come from that.\"\\n\\n\"Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them\\nhonourably.\"\\n\\nAh, so that was it!\\n\\n\"Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there\\nis neither love nor God,\" I retorted warmly, \"and where there is no\\nlove, there is no sense either.  There are such families, it\\'s true,\\nbut I am not speaking of them.  You must have seen wickedness in your\\nown family, if you talk like that.  Truly, you must have been unlucky.\\nH\\'m! ... that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.\"\\n\\n\"And is it any better with the gentry?  Even among the poor, honest\\npeople who live happily?\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m ... yes.  Perhaps.  Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning\\nup his troubles, but does not count his joys.  If he counted them up as\\nhe ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for\\nit. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God\\nis upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you,\\nnever leaves you! There is happiness in such a family!  Even sometimes\\nthere is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is\\neverywhere.  If you marry YOU WILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.  But think of\\nthe first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what\\nhappiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it\\'s the ordinary thing.\\nIn those early days even quarrels with one\\'s husband end happily.  Some\\nwomen get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them.\\nIndeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she\\nloved him, she would torment him and make him feel it.  You know that\\nyou may torment a man on purpose through love.  Women are particularly\\ngiven to that, thinking to themselves \\'I will love him so, I will make\\nso much of him afterwards, that it\\'s no sin to torment him a little\\nnow.\\' And all in the  house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are\\nhappy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some\\nwomen who are jealous.  If he went off anywhere--I knew one such woman,\\nshe couldn\\'t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off\\non the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other\\nwoman.  That\\'s a pity.  And the woman knows herself it\\'s wrong, and her\\nheart fails her and she suffers, but she loves--it\\'s all through love.\\nAnd how sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the\\nwrong or to forgive him!  And they both are so happy all at once--as\\nthough they had met anew, been married over again; as though their love\\nhad begun afresh.  And no one, no one should know what passes between\\nhusband and wife if they love one another.  And whatever quarrels there\\nmay be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge\\nbetween them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges.\\nLove is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes,\\nwhatever happens.  That makes it holier and better. They respect one\\nanother more, and much is built on respect.  And if once there has been\\nlove, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?\\nSurely one can keep it!  It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the\\nhusband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The\\nfirst phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will\\ncome a love that is better still.  Then there will be the union of\\nsouls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets\\nbetween them. And once they have children, the most difficult times\\nwill seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage.  Even\\ntoil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and\\neven that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you\\nare laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that\\nyou are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your\\nchildren will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have\\nreceived them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness.\\nSo you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and\\nmother nearer?  People say it\\'s a trial to have children.  Who says\\nthat?  It is heavenly happiness!  Are you fond of little children,\\nLiza?  I am awfully fond of them.  You know--a little rosy baby boy at\\nyour bosom, and what husband\\'s heart is not touched, seeing his wife\\nnursing his child!  A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling,\\nchubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it\\nmakes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand\\neverything.  And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its\\nlittle hand, plays.  When its father comes up, the child tears itself\\naway from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs,\\nas though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again.  Or it\\nwill bite its mother\\'s breast when its little teeth are coming, while\\nit looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, \\'Look,\\nI am biting!\\' Is not all that happiness when they are the three\\ntogether, husband, wife and child?  One can forgive a great deal for\\nthe sake of such moments.  Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live\\noneself before one blames others!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,\" I thought\\nto myself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I\\nflushed crimson.  \"What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing,\\nwhat should I do then?\" That idea drove me to fury.  Towards the end of\\nmy speech I really was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded.\\nThe silence continued.  I almost nudged her.\\n\\n\"Why are you--\" she began and stopped.  But I understood: there was a\\nquiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and\\nunyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced\\nthat I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.\\n\\n\"What?\" I asked, with tender curiosity.\\n\\n\"Why, you...\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,\" she said, and again there was\\na note of irony in her voice.\\n\\nThat remark sent a pang to my heart.  It was not what I was expecting.\\n\\nI did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that\\nthis is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when\\nthe privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that\\ntheir pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and\\nshrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.  I ought to\\nhave guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly\\napproached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with\\nan effort.  But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of\\nme.\\n\\n\"Wait a bit!\" I thought.\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\"Oh, hush, Liza!  How can you talk about being like a book, when it\\nmakes even me, an outsider, feel sick?  Though I don\\'t look at it as an\\noutsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart....  Is it possible,\\nis it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself?\\nEvidently habit does wonders!  God knows what habit can do with anyone.\\nCan you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will\\nalways be good-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and\\never?  I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though\\nlet me tell you this about it--about your present life, I mean; here\\nthough you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet\\nyou know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at\\nbeing here with you!  One can only come here when one is drunk.  But if\\nyou were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be\\nmore than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be\\nglad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your\\ndoor, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my\\nbetrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to.  I should not dare\\nto have an impure thought about you.  But here, you see, I know that I\\nhave only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it\\nor not.  I don\\'t consult your wishes, but you mine.  The lowest\\nlabourer hires himself as a workman, but he doesn\\'t make a slave of\\nhimself altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again\\npresently.  But when are you free?  Only think what you are giving up\\nhere?  What is it you are making a slave of?  It is your soul, together\\nwith your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to\\ndispose of!  You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard!\\nLove!  But that\\'s everything, you know, it\\'s a priceless diamond, it\\'s\\na maiden\\'s treasure, love--why, a man would be ready to give his soul,\\nto face death to gain that love.  But how much is your love worth now?\\nYou are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive\\nfor love when you can have everything without love.  And you know there\\nis no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand?  To be\\nsure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have\\nlovers of your own here.  But you know that\\'s simply a farce, that\\'s\\nsimply a sham, it\\'s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it!\\nWhy, do you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours?  I don\\'t\\nbelieve it.  How can he love you when he knows you may be called away\\nfrom him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did!  Will he have\\na grain of respect for you?  What have you in common with him?  He\\nlaughs at you and robs you--that is all his love amounts to!  You are\\nlucky if he does not beat you.  Very likely he does beat you, too.  Ask\\nhim, if you have got one, whether he will marry you.  He will laugh in\\nyour face, if he doesn\\'t spit in it or give you a blow--though maybe he\\nis not worth a bad halfpenny himself.  And for what have you ruined\\nyour life, if you come to think of it?  For the coffee they give you to\\ndrink and the plentiful meals?  But with what object are they feeding\\nyou up?  An honest girl couldn\\'t swallow the food, for she would know\\nwhat she was being fed for.  You are in debt here, and, of course, you\\nwill always be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the\\nvisitors here begin to scorn you.  And that will soon happen, don\\'t\\nrely upon your youth--all that flies by express train here, you know.\\nYou will be kicked out.  And not simply kicked out; long before that\\nshe\\'ll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you\\nhad not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth\\nand your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her,\\nbeggared her, robbed her.  And don\\'t expect anyone to take your part:\\nthe others, your companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for\\nall are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here\\nlong ago.  They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is\\nviler, more loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse.  And you\\nare laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and\\nbeauty and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of\\nfive-and-thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to\\nGod for that!  No doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time\\nand no work to do!  Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the\\nworld or ever has been.  One would think that the heart alone would be\\nworn out with tears.  And you won\\'t dare to say a word, not half a word\\nwhen they drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were\\nto blame.  You will change to another house, then to a third, then\\nsomewhere else, till you come down at last to the Haymarket.  There you\\nwill be beaten at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors\\ndon\\'t know how to be friendly without beating you.  You don\\'t believe\\nthat it is so hateful there?  Go and look for yourself some time, you\\ncan see with your own eyes.  Once, one New Year\\'s Day, I saw a woman at\\na door.  They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the\\nfrost because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door\\nbehind her.  At nine o\\'clock in the morning she was already quite\\ndrunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was\\npowdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose\\nand her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing.  She was\\nsitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her hand;\\nshe was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating with the\\nfish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the\\ndoorway taunting her.  You don\\'t believe that you will ever be like\\nthat?  I should be sorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe\\nten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here\\nfresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every\\nword.  Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like\\nthe others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness\\nwas in store for the man who should love her and whom she should love.\\nDo you see how it ended?  And what if at that very minute when she was\\nbeating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and\\ndishevelled--what if at that very minute she recalled the pure early\\ndays in her father\\'s house, when she used to go to school and the\\nneighbour\\'s son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would\\nlove her as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and\\nwhen they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as\\nthey were grown up!  No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to\\ndie soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman\\njust now.  In the hospital, do you say?  You will be lucky if they take\\nyou, but what if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is\\na queer disease, it is not like fever.  The patient goes on hoping till\\nthe last minute and says he is all right.  He deludes himself And that\\njust suits your madam.  Don\\'t doubt it, that\\'s how it is; you have sold\\nyour soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren\\'t say a word.\\nBut when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from\\nyou, for then there will be nothing to get from you.  What\\'s more, they\\nwill reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over\\ndying.  However you beg you won\\'t get a drink of water without abuse:\\n\\'Whenever are you going off, you nasty hussy, you won\\'t let us sleep\\nwith your moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.\\'  That\\'s true, I have\\nheard such things said myself.  They will thrust you dying into the\\nfilthiest corner in the cellar--in the damp and darkness; what will\\nyour thoughts be, lying there alone?  When you die, strange hands will\\nlay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no\\none will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may\\nbe; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor\\nwoman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern.  In the grave,\\nsleet, filth, wet snow--no need to put themselves out for you--\\'Let her\\ndown, Vanuha; it\\'s just like her luck--even here, she is head-foremost,\\nthe hussy.  Shorten the cord, you rascal.\\'  \\'It\\'s all right as it is.\\'\\n\\'All right, is it?  Why, she\\'s on her side!  She was a fellow-creature,\\nafter all!  But, never mind, throw the earth on her.\\'  And they won\\'t\\ncare to waste much time quarrelling over you.  They will scatter the\\nwet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern ... and\\nthere your memory on earth will end; other women have children to go to\\ntheir graves, fathers, husbands.  While for you neither tear, nor sigh,\\nnor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you, your\\nname will vanish from the face of the earth--as though you had never\\nexisted, never been born at all!  Nothing but filth and mud, however\\nyou knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead arise, however you\\ncry: \\'Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day!  My life\\nwas no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it\\nwas drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people,\\nto live in the world again.\\'\"\\n\\nAnd I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in\\nmy throat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay\\nand, bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart.\\nI had reason to be troubled.\\n\\nI had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and\\nrending her heart, and--and the more I was convinced of it, the more\\neagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as\\npossible.  It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it\\nwas not merely sport....\\n\\nI knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I\\ncould not speak except \"like a book.\"  But that did not trouble me: I\\nknew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness\\nmight be an assistance.  But now, having attained my effect, I was\\nsuddenly panic-stricken.  Never before had I witnessed such despair!\\nShe was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and\\nclutching it in both hands.  Her heart was being torn.  Her youthful\\nbody was shuddering all over as though in convulsions.  Suppressed sobs\\nrent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she\\npressed closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a\\nliving soul, to know of her anguish and her tears.  She bit the pillow,\\nbit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her\\nfingers into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of\\nrestraint, holding her breath and clenching her teeth.  I began saying\\nsomething, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare;\\nand all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began\\nfumbling in the dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go.  It was\\ndark; though I tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly.\\nSuddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle\\nin it.  As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in\\nbed, and with a contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me\\nalmost senselessly.  I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came\\nto herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught\\nhold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.\\n\\n\"Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,\" I began, but she\\nsqueezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the\\nwrong thing and stopped.\\n\\n\"This is my address, Liza, come to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will come,\" she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.\\n\\n\"But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.\"\\n\\nI got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a\\nshudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled\\nherself in it to her chin.  As she did this she gave another sickly\\nsmile, blushed and looked at me strangely.  I felt wretched; I was in\\nhaste to get away--to disappear.\\n\\n\"Wait a minute,\" she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,\\nstopping me with her hand on my overcoat.  She put down the candle in\\nhot haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted\\nto show me something.  As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and\\nthere was a smile on her lips--what was the meaning of it?  Against my\\nwill I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that\\nseemed to ask forgiveness for something.  In fact, it was not the same\\nface, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and\\nobstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time\\ntrustful, caressing, timid.  The expression with which children look at\\npeople they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour.  Her\\neyes were a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and\\ncapable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred.\\n\\nMaking no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must\\nunderstand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of\\npaper to me.  Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant\\nwith naive, almost childish, triumph.  I unfolded it.  It was a letter\\nto her from a medical student or someone of that sort--a very\\nhigh-flown and flowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter.  I don\\'t\\nrecall the words now, but I remember well that through the high-flown\\nphrases there was apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned.\\nWhen I had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and\\nchildishly impatient eyes fixed upon me.  She fastened her eyes upon my\\nface and waited impatiently for what I should say.  In a few words,\\nhurriedly, but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that\\nshe had been to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of \"very\\nnice people, WHO KNEW NOTHING, absolutely nothing, for she had only\\ncome here so lately and it had all happened ... and she hadn\\'t made up\\nher mind to stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid\\nher debt...\" and at that party there had been the student who had\\ndanced with her all the evening.  He had talked to her, and it turned\\nout that he had known her in old days at Riga when he was a child, they\\nhad played together, but a very long time ago--and he knew her parents,\\nbut ABOUT THIS he knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion!\\nAnd the day after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that\\nletter through the friend with whom she had gone to the party ... and\\n... well, that was all.\\n\\nShe dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished.\\n\\nThe poor girl was keeping that student\\'s letter as a precious treasure,\\nand had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me\\nto go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely\\nloved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully.  No doubt that letter\\nwas destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing.  But none the less,\\nI am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious\\ntreasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she\\nhad thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise\\nherself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of\\nher.  I said nothing, pressed her hand and went out.  I so longed to\\nget away ... I walked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the\\nmelting snow was still falling in heavy flakes.  I was exhausted,\\nshattered, in bewilderment.  But behind the bewilderment the truth was\\nalready gleaming.  The loathsome truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth.\\nWaking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and\\nimmediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was\\npositively amazed at my last night\\'s SENTIMENTALITY with Liza, at all\\nthose \"outcries of horror and pity.\"  \"To think of having such an\\nattack of womanish hysteria, pah!\" I concluded.  And what did I thrust\\nmy address upon her for?  What if she comes?  Let her come, though; it\\ndoesn\\'t matter....  But OBVIOUSLY, that was not now the chief and the\\nmost important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my\\nreputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible;\\nthat was the chief business.  And I was so taken up that morning that I\\nactually forgot all about Liza.\\n\\nFirst of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before\\nfrom Simonov.  I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen\\nroubles straight off from Anton Antonitch.  As luck would have it he\\nwas in the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on\\nthe first asking.  I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU\\nwith a swaggering air, I told him casually that the night before \"I had\\nbeen keeping it up with some friends at the Hotel de Paris; we were\\ngiving a farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of\\nmy childhood, and you know--a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt--of\\ncourse, he belongs to a good family, and has considerable means, a\\nbrilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you\\nunderstand; we drank an extra \\'half-dozen\\' and ...\"\\n\\nAnd it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily,\\nunconstrainedly and complacently.\\n\\nOn reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.\\n\\nTo this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly\\ngentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter.  With tact and\\ngood-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I\\nblamed myself for all that had happened.  I defended myself, \"if I\\nreally may be allowed to defend myself,\" by alleging that being utterly\\nunaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass,\\nwhich I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for\\nthem at the Hotel de Paris between five and six o\\'clock.  I begged\\nSimonov\\'s pardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to\\nall the others, especially to Zverkov, whom \"I seemed to remember as\\nthough in a dream\" I had insulted.  I added that I would have called\\nupon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the\\nface to.  I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost\\ncarelessness (strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which\\nwas apparent in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave\\nthem at once to understand that I took rather an independent view of\\n\"all that unpleasantness last night\"; that I was by no means so utterly\\ncrushed as you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary,\\nlooked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look\\nupon it.  \"On a young hero\\'s past no censure is cast!\"\\n\\n\"There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!\" I thought\\nadmiringly, as I read over the letter.  \"And it\\'s all because I am an\\nintellectual and cultivated man!  Another man in my place would not\\nhave known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and\\nam as jolly as ever again, and all because I am \\'a cultivated and\\neducated man of our day.\\' And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to\\nthe wine yesterday.  H\\'m!\" ...  No, it was not the wine.  I did not\\ndrink anything at all between five and six when I was waiting for them.\\nI had lied to Simonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn\\'t\\nashamed now.... Hang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid\\nof it.\\n\\nI put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to\\ntake it to Simonov.  When he learned that there was money in the\\nletter, Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it.  Towards\\nevening I went out for a walk.  My head was still aching and giddy\\nafter yesterday.  But as evening came on and the twilight grew denser,\\nmy impressions and, following them, my thoughts, grew more and more\\ndifferent and confused. Something was not dead within me, in the depths\\nof my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in\\nacute depression.  For the most part I jostled my way through the most\\ncrowded business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy\\nStreet and in Yusupov Garden. I always liked particularly sauntering\\nalong these streets in the dusk, just when there were crowds of working\\npeople of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces\\nlooking cross with anxiety.  What I liked was just that cheap bustle,\\nthat bare prose.  On this occasion the jostling of the streets\\nirritated me more than ever, I could not make out what was wrong with\\nme, I could not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually\\nin my soul, painfully, and refusing to be appeased.  I returned home\\ncompletely upset, it was just as though some crime were lying on my\\nconscience.\\n\\nThe thought that Liza was coming worried me continually.  It seemed\\nqueer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented\\nme, as it were, especially, as it were, quite separately.  Everything\\nelse I had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it\\nall and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov.  But\\non this point I was not satisfied at all.  It was as though I were\\nworried only by Liza.  \"What if she comes,\" I thought incessantly,\\n\"well, it doesn\\'t matter, let her come! H\\'m! it\\'s horrid that she\\nshould see, for instance, how I live.  Yesterday I seemed such a hero\\nto her, while now, h\\'m!  It\\'s horrid, though, that I have let myself go\\nso, the room looks like a beggar\\'s.  And I brought myself to go out to\\ndinner in such a suit!  And my American leather sofa with the stuffing\\nsticking out.  And my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such\\ntatters, and she will see all this and she will see Apollon.  That\\nbeast is certain to insult her.  He will fasten upon her in order to be\\nrude to me. And I, of course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall\\nbegin bowing and scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round\\nme, I shall begin smiling, telling lies.  Oh, the beastliness!  And it\\nisn\\'t the beastliness of it that matters most!  There is something more\\nimportant, more loathsome, viler!  Yes, viler!  And to put on that\\ndishonest lying mask again! ...\"\\n\\nWhen I reached that thought I fired up all at once.\\n\\n\"Why dishonest?  How dishonest?  I was speaking sincerely last night.\\nI remember there was real feeling in me, too.  What I wanted was to\\nexcite an honourable feeling in her....  Her crying was a good thing,\\nit will have a good effect.\"\\n\\nYet I could not feel at ease.  All that evening, even when I had come\\nback home, even after nine o\\'clock, when I calculated that Liza could\\nnot possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came\\nback to my mind always in the same position.  One moment out of all\\nthat had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the\\nmoment when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its\\nlook of torture.  And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a\\ndistorted smile she had at that moment!  But I did not know then, that\\nfifteen years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always\\nwith the pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face\\nat that minute.\\n\\nNext day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to\\nover-excited nerves, and, above all, as EXAGGERATED.  I was always\\nconscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of\\nit.  \"I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,\" I repeated to\\nmyself every hour.  But, however, \"Liza will very likely come all the\\nsame,\" was the refrain with which all my reflections ended.  I was so\\nuneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: \"She\\'ll come, she is certain\\nto come!\" I cried, running about the room, \"if not today, she will come\\ntomorrow; she\\'ll find me out!  The damnable romanticism of these pure\\nhearts!  Oh, the vileness--oh, the silliness--oh, the stupidity of\\nthese \\'wretched sentimental souls!\\' Why, how fail to understand?  How\\ncould one fail to understand? ...\"\\n\\nBut at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.\\n\\nAnd how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how\\nlittle of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic\\ntoo) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my\\nwill.  That\\'s virginity, to be sure!  Freshness of soil!\\n\\nAt times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, \"to tell her all,\" and\\nbeg her not to come to me.  But this thought stirred such wrath in me\\nthat I believed I should have crushed that \"damned\" Liza if she had\\nchanced to be near me at the time.  I should have insulted her, have\\nspat at her, have turned her out, have struck her!\\n\\nOne day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I\\nbegan to grow calmer.  I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine\\no\\'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for\\ninstance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me\\nand my talking to her.... I develop her, educate her.  Finally, I\\nnotice that she loves me, loves me passionately.  I pretend not to\\nunderstand (I don\\'t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect,\\nperhaps).  At last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing,\\nshe flings herself at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that\\nshe loves me better than anything in the world.  I am amazed, but....\\n\"Liza,\" I say, \"can you imagine that I have not noticed your love?  I\\nsaw it all, I divined it, but I did not dare to approach you first,\\nbecause I had an influence over you and was afraid that you would force\\nyourself, from gratitude, to respond to my love, would try to rouse in\\nyour heart a feeling which was perhaps absent, and I did not wish that\\n... because it would be tyranny ... it would be indelicate (in short, I\\nlaunch off at that point into European, inexplicably lofty subtleties a\\nla George Sand), but now, now you are mine, you are my creation, you\\nare pure, you are good, you are my noble wife.\\n\\n     \\'Into my house come bold and free,\\n     Its rightful mistress there to be\\'.\"\\n\\nThen we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on.  In\\nfact, in the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out\\nmy tongue at myself.\\n\\nBesides, they won\\'t let her out, \"the hussy!\" I thought.  They don\\'t\\nlet them go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some\\nreason I fancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o\\'clock\\nprecisely). Though she did say she was not altogether a slave there\\nyet, and had certain rights; so, h\\'m!  Damn it all, she will come, she\\nis sure to come!\\n\\nIt was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at\\nthat time by his rudeness.  He drove me beyond all patience!  He was\\nthe bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence.  We had been\\nsquabbling continually for years, and I hated him.  My God, how I hated\\nhim! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him,\\nespecially at some moments.  He was an elderly, dignified man, who\\nworked part of his time as a tailor.  But for some unknown reason he\\ndespised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably.\\nThough, indeed, he looked down upon everyone.  Simply to glance at that\\nflaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his\\nforehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth,\\ncompressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was\\nconfronting a man who never doubted of himself.  He was a pedant, to\\nthe most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and\\nwith that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon.  He was in\\nlove with every button on his coat, every nail on his\\nfingers--absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! In his\\nbehaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me,\\nand if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically\\nself-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to\\nfury. He did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour,\\nthough he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed, consider\\nhimself bound to do anything.  There could be no doubt that he looked\\nupon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that \"he did not get rid of\\nme\" was simply that he could get wages from me every month.  He\\nconsented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month.  Many sins\\nshould be forgiven me for what I suffered from him.  My hatred reached\\nsuch a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into\\nconvulsions.  What I loathed particularly was his lisp.  His tongue\\nmust have been a little too long or something of that sort, for he\\ncontinually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that\\nit greatly added to his dignity.  He spoke in a slow, measured tone,\\nwith his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground.  He\\nmaddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself\\nbehind his partition.  Many a battle I waged over that reading!  But he\\nwas awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even,\\nsing-song voice, as though over the dead.  It is interesting that that\\nis how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the\\ndead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking.  But at\\nthat time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were\\nchemically combined with my existence.  Besides, nothing would have\\ninduced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished\\nlodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in\\nwhich I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me,\\nfor some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I\\ncould not turn him away.\\n\\nTo be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was\\nimpossible.  He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known\\nwhere to hide my head.  But I was so exasperated with everyone during\\nthose days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object\\nto PUNISH Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that\\nwere owing him.  I had for a long time--for the last two years--been\\nintending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself\\nairs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his\\nwages.  I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely\\nsilent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the\\nfirst to speak of his wages.  Then I would take the seven roubles out\\nof a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I\\nwon\\'t, I won\\'t, I simply won\\'t pay him his wages, I won\\'t just because\\nthat is \"what I wish,\" because \"I am master, and it is for me to\\ndecide,\" because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude;\\nbut if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to\\nhim, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a\\nwhole month....\\n\\nBut angry as I was, yet he got the better of me.  I could not hold out\\nfor four days.  He began as he always did begin in such cases, for\\nthere had been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may\\nbe observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by\\nheart).  He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare,\\nkeeping it up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me\\nor seeing me out of the house.  If I held out and pretended not to\\nnotice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further\\ntortures.  All at once, A PROPOS of nothing, he would walk softly and\\nsmoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand\\nat the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other,\\nand fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous.  If I\\nsuddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but\\ncontinue staring at me persistently for some seconds, then, with a\\npeculiar compression of his lips and a most significant air,\\ndeliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room.  Two\\nhours later he would come out again and again present himself before me\\nin the same way.  It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask\\nhim what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously\\nand began staring back at him.  So we stared at one another for two\\nminutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back\\nagain for two hours.\\n\\nIf I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my\\nrevolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,\\ndeep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral\\ndegradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing\\ncompletely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he\\nwanted.\\n\\nThis time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost\\nmy temper and flew at him in a fury.  I was irritated beyond endurance\\napart from him.\\n\\n\"Stay,\" I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning,\\nwith one hand behind his back, to go to his room.  \"Stay!  Come back,\\ncome back, I tell you!\" and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he\\nturned round and even looked at me with some wonder.  However, he\\npersisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me.\\n\\n\"How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for?\\nAnswer!\"\\n\\nAfter looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Stay!\" I roared, running up to him, \"don\\'t stir!  There.  Answer, now:\\nwhat did you come in to look at?\"\\n\\n\"If you have any order to give me it\\'s my duty to carry it out,\" he\\nanswered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp,\\nraising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to\\nanother, all this with exasperating composure.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!\" I shouted,\\nturning crimson with anger.  \"I\\'ll tell you why you came here myself:\\nyou see, I don\\'t give you your wages, you are so proud you don\\'t want\\nto bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your\\nstupid stares, to worry me and you have no sus-pic-ion how stupid it\\nis--stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! ...\"\\n\\nHe would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" I shouted to him.  \"Here\\'s the money, do you see, here it\\nis,\" (I took it out of the table drawer); \"here\\'s the seven roubles\\ncomplete, but you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ...\\ngoing ... to ... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to\\nbeg my pardon. Do you hear?\"\\n\\n\"That cannot be,\" he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.\\n\\n\"It shall be so,\" I said, \"I give you my word of honour, it shall be!\"\\n\\n\"And there\\'s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,\" he went on, as\\nthough he had not noticed my exclamations at all.  \"Why, besides, you\\ncalled me a \\'torturer,\\' for which I can summon you at the\\npolice-station at any time for insulting behaviour.\"\\n\\n\"Go, summon me,\" I roared, \"go at once, this very minute, this very\\nsecond!  You are a torturer all the same!  a torturer!\"\\n\\nBut he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud\\ncalls to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without\\nlooking round.\\n\\n\"If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,\" I\\ndecided inwardly.  Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind\\nhis screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating\\nslowly and violently.\\n\\n\"Apollon,\" I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless,\\n\"go at once without a minute\\'s delay and fetch the police-officer.\"\\n\\nHe had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles\\nand taken up some sewing.  But, hearing my order, he burst into a\\nguffaw.\\n\\n\"At once, go this minute!  Go on, or else you can\\'t imagine what will\\nhappen.\"\\n\\n\"You are certainly out of your mind,\" he observed, without even raising\\nhis head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle.\\n\"Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?  And as\\nfor being frightened--you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for\\nnothing will come of it.\"\\n\\n\"Go!\" I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder.  I felt I should\\nstrike him in a minute.\\n\\nBut I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open\\nat that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at\\nus in perplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back\\nto my room.  There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my\\nhead against the wall and stood motionless in that position.\\n\\nTwo minutes later I heard Apollon\\'s deliberate footsteps.  \"There is\\nsome woman asking for you,\" he said, looking at me with peculiar\\nseverity.  Then he stood aside and let in Liza.  He would not go away,\\nbut stared at us sarcastically.\\n\\n\"Go away, go away,\" I commanded in desperation.  At that moment my\\nclock began whirring and wheezing and struck seven.\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n     \"Into my house come bold and free,\\n     Its rightful mistress there to be.\"\\n\\nI stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I\\nbelieve I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my\\nragged wadded dressing-gown--exactly as I had imagined the scene not\\nlong before in a fit of depression.  After standing over us for a\\ncouple of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at\\nease.  What made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with\\nconfusion, more so, in fact, than I should have expected.  At the sight\\nof me, of course.\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I\\nsat down on the sofa.  She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me\\nopen-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once.  This naivete\\nof expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.\\n\\nShe ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as\\nusual, while instead of that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should\\nmake her pay dearly for ALL THIS.\\n\\n\"You have found me in a strange position, Liza,\" I began, stammering\\nand knowing that this was the wrong way to begin.  \"No, no, don\\'t\\nimagine anything,\" I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed.  \"I\\nam not ashamed of my poverty....  On the contrary, I look with pride\\non my poverty.  I am poor but honourable....  One can be poor and\\nhonourable,\" I muttered.  \"However ... would you like tea?....\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she was beginning.\\n\\n\"Wait a minute.\"\\n\\nI leapt up and ran to Apollon.  I had to get out of the room somehow.\\n\\n\"Apollon,\" I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the\\nseven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist,\\n\"here are your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must\\ncome to my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant.\\nIf you won\\'t go, you\\'ll make me a miserable man!  You don\\'t know what\\nthis woman is.... This is--everything!  You may be imagining\\nsomething.... But you don\\'t know what that woman is! ...\"\\n\\nApollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles\\nagain, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or\\nputting down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention\\nto me or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle,\\nwhich he had not yet threaded.  I waited before him for three minutes\\nwith my arms crossed A LA NAPOLEON.  My temples were moist with sweat.\\nI was pale, I felt it.  But, thank God, he must have been moved to\\npity, looking at me.  Having threaded his needle he deliberately got up\\nfrom his seat, deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off\\nhis spectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me\\nover his shoulder: \"Shall I get a whole portion?\" deliberately walked\\nout of the room.  As I was going back to Liza, the thought occurred to\\nme on the way: shouldn\\'t I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown,\\nno matter where, and then let happen what would?\\n\\nI sat down again.  She looked at me uneasily.  For some minutes we were\\nsilent.\\n\\n\"I will kill him,\" I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist\\nso that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.\\n\\n\"What are you saying!\" she cried, starting.\\n\\n\"I will kill him!  kill him!\" I shrieked, suddenly striking the table\\nin absolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid\\nit was to be in such a frenzy.  \"You don\\'t know, Liza, what that\\ntorturer is to me. He is my torturer....  He has gone now to fetch\\nsome rusks; he ...\"\\n\\nAnd suddenly I burst into tears.  It was an hysterical attack.  How\\nashamed I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain\\nthem.\\n\\nShe was frightened.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?  What is wrong?\" she cried, fussing about me.\\n\\n\"Water, give me water, over there!\" I muttered in a faint voice, though\\nI was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without\\nwater and without muttering in a faint voice.  But I was, what is\\ncalled, PUTTING IT ON, to save appearances, though the attack was a\\ngenuine one.\\n\\nShe gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment.  At that moment\\nApollon brought in the tea.  It suddenly seemed to me that this\\ncommonplace, prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all\\nthat had happened, and I blushed crimson.  Liza looked at Apollon with\\npositive alarm.  He went out without a glance at either of us.\\n\\n\"Liza, do you despise me?\" I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling\\nwith impatience to know what she was thinking.\\n\\nShe was confused, and did not know what to answer.\\n\\n\"Drink your tea,\" I said to her angrily.  I was angry with myself, but,\\nof course, it was she who would have to pay for it.  A horrible spite\\nagainst her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have\\nkilled her.  To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a\\nword to her all the time.  \"She is the cause of it all,\" I thought.\\n\\nOur silence lasted for five minutes.  The tea stood on the table; we\\ndid not touch it.  I had got to the point of purposely refraining from\\nbeginning in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to\\nbegin alone.  Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity.\\nI was obstinately silent.  I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer,\\nbecause I was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful\\nstupidity, and yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.\\n\\n\"I want to... get away ... from there altogether,\" she began, to break\\nthe silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought\\nnot to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as\\nI was. My heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and\\nunnecessary straightforwardness.  But something hideous at once stifled\\nall compassion in me; it even provoked me to greater venom.  I did not\\ncare what happened.  Another five minutes passed.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I am in your way,\" she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was\\ngetting up.\\n\\nBut as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively\\ntrembled with spite, and at once burst out.\\n\\n\"Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?\" I began, gasping for\\nbreath and regardless of logical connection in my words.  I longed to\\nhave it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to\\nbegin.  \"Why have you come?  Answer, answer,\" I cried, hardly knowing\\nwhat I was doing.  \"I\\'ll tell you, my good girl, why you have come.\\nYou\\'ve come because I talked sentimental stuff to you then.  So now you\\nare soft as butter and longing for fine sentiments again.  So you may\\nas well know that I was laughing at you then.  And I am laughing at you\\nnow.  Why are you shuddering?  Yes, I was laughing at you!  I had been\\ninsulted just before, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening\\nbefore me.  I came to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer;\\nbut I didn\\'t succeed, I didn\\'t find him; I had to avenge the insult on\\nsomeone to get back my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on\\nyou and laughed at you.  I had been humiliated, so I wanted to\\nhumiliate; I had been treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power....\\nThat\\'s what it was, and you imagined I had come there on purpose\\nto save you.  Yes?  You imagined that?  You imagined that?\"\\n\\nI knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in\\nexactly, but I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very\\nwell indeed.  And so, indeed, she did.  She turned white as a\\nhandkerchief, tried to say something, and her lips worked painfully;\\nbut she sank on a chair as though she had been felled by an axe.  And\\nall the time afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her\\neyes wide open, shuddering with awful terror.  The cynicism, the\\ncynicism of my words overwhelmed her....\\n\\n\"Save you!\" I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down\\nthe room before her.  \"Save you from what?  But perhaps I am worse than\\nyou myself.  Why didn\\'t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you\\nthat sermon: \\'But what did you come here yourself for?  was it to read\\nus a sermon?\\'  Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I\\nwanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your\\nhysteria--that was what I wanted then!  Of course, I couldn\\'t keep it\\nup then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the\\ndevil knows why, gave you my address in my folly.  Afterwards, before I\\ngot home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I\\nhated you already because of the lies I had told you.  Because I only\\nlike playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really\\nwant is that you should all go to hell.  That is what I want.  I want\\npeace; yes, I\\'d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so\\nlong as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go\\nwithout my tea?  I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I\\nalways get my tea.  Did you know that, or not?  Well, anyway, I know\\nthat I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard.  Here I\\nhave been shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your\\ncoming.  And do you know what has worried me particularly for these\\nthree days?  That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see\\nme in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you\\njust now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know\\nthat I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more\\nafraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief, because I am as\\nvain as though I had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt.\\nSurely by now you must realise that I shall never forgive you for\\nhaving found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at\\nApollon like a spiteful cur.  The saviour, the former hero, was flying\\nlike a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was\\njeering at him!  And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could\\nnot help shedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to\\nshame!  And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive\\nyou either! Yes--you must answer for it all because you turned up like\\nthis, because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest,\\nabsurdest and most envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit\\nbetter than I am, but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion;\\nwhile I shall always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom!  And\\nwhat is it to me that you don\\'t understand a word of this!  And what do\\nI care, what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or\\nnot?  Do you understand?  How I shall hate you now after saying this,\\nfor having been here and listening. Why, it\\'s not once in a lifetime a\\nman speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics!  ...  What more\\ndo you want?  Why do you still stand confronting me, after all this?\\nWhy are you worrying me?  Why don\\'t you go?\"\\n\\nBut at this point a strange thing happened.  I was so accustomed to\\nthink and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in\\nthe world to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand,\\nthat I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance.  What\\nhappened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great\\ndeal more than I imagined.  She understood from all this what a woman\\nunderstands first of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I\\nwas myself unhappy.\\n\\nThe frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by\\na look of sorrowful perplexity.  When I began calling myself a\\nscoundrel and a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was\\naccompanied throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively.\\nShe was on the point of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she\\ntook no notice of my shouting: \"Why are you here, why don\\'t you go\\naway?\" but realised only that it must have been very bitter to me to\\nsay all this.  Besides, she was so crushed, poor girl; she considered\\nherself infinitely beneath me; how could she feel anger or resentment?\\nShe suddenly leapt up from her chair with an irresistible impulse and\\nheld out her hands, yearning towards me, though still timid and not\\ndaring to stir....  At this point there was a revulsion in my heart\\ntoo.  Then she suddenly rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst\\ninto tears.  I, too, could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never\\nhad before.\\n\\n\"They won\\'t let me ... I can\\'t be good!\" I managed to articulate; then\\nI went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a\\nquarter of an hour in genuine hysterics.  She came close to me, put her\\narms round me and stayed motionless in that position.  But the trouble\\nwas that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the\\nloathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust\\ninto my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a\\nfar-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward\\nnow for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face.  Why\\nwas I ashamed?  I don\\'t know, but I was ashamed.  The thought, too,\\ncame into my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely\\nchanged, that she was now the heroine, while I was just a crushed and\\nhumiliated creature as she had been before me that night--four days\\nbefore....  And all this came into my mind during the minutes I was\\nlying on my face on the sofa.\\n\\nMy God! surely I was not envious of her then.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course,\\nI was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now.  I\\ncannot get on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ...\\nthere is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to\\nreason.\\n\\nI conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner\\nor later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I\\nwas ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled\\nand flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession.  My\\neyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly.  How I\\nhated her and how I was drawn to her at that minute!  The one feeling\\nintensified the other.  It was almost like an act of vengeance.  At\\nfirst there was a look of amazement, even of terror on her face, but\\nonly for one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced me.\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in\\nfrenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and\\npeeped through the crack at Liza.  She was sitting on the ground with\\nher head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying.  But she\\ndid not go away, and that irritated me.  This time she understood it\\nall.  I had insulted her finally, but ... there\\'s no need to describe\\nit.  She realised that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge,\\na fresh humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred\\nwas added now a PERSONAL HATRED, born of envy....  Though I do not\\nmaintain positively that she understood all this distinctly; but she\\ncertainly did fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what\\nwas worse, incapable of loving her.\\n\\nI know I shall be told that this is incredible--but it is incredible to\\nbe as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange\\nI should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love.  Why is it\\nstrange?  In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I\\nrepeat, with me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral\\nsuperiority.  I have never in my life been able to imagine any other\\nsort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking\\nthat love really consists in the right--freely given by the beloved\\nobject--to tyrannise over her.\\n\\nEven in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a\\nstruggle.  I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral\\nsubjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated\\nobject. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded\\nin so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with \"real life,\"\\nas to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to\\nshame for having come to me to hear \"fine sentiments\"; and did not even\\nguess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me,\\nbecause to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of\\nruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show\\nitself in that form.\\n\\nI did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room\\nand peeping through the crack in the screen.  I was only insufferably\\noppressed by her being here.  I wanted her to disappear.  I wanted\\n\"peace,\" to be left alone in my underground world.  Real life oppressed\\nme with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.\\n\\nBut several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as\\nthough she were unconscious.  I had the shamelessness to tap softly at\\nthe screen as though to remind her....  She started, sprang up, and\\nflew to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her\\nescape from me....  Two minutes later she came from behind the screen\\nand looked with heavy eyes at me.  I gave a spiteful grin, which was\\nforced, however, to KEEP UP APPEARANCES, and I turned away from her\\neyes.\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, going towards the door.\\n\\nI ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and\\nclosed it again.  Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the\\nother corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....\\n\\nI did mean a moment since to tell a lie--to write that I did this\\naccidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through\\nlosing my head.  But I don\\'t want to lie, and so I will say straight\\nout that I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite.  It\\ncame into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room\\nand she was sitting behind the screen.  But this I can say for certain:\\nthough I did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the\\nheart, but came from my evil brain.  This cruelty was so affected, so\\npurposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that\\nI could not even keep it up a minute--first I dashed away to avoid\\nseeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza.  I opened\\nthe door in the passage and began listening.\\n\\n\"Liza!  Liza!\" I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.\\nThere was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on\\nthe stairs.\\n\\n\"Liza!\" I cried, more loudly.\\n\\nNo answer.  But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open\\nheavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the stairs.\\n\\nShe had gone.  I went back to my room in hesitation.  I felt horribly\\noppressed.\\n\\nI stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and\\nlooked aimlessly before me.  A minute passed, suddenly I started;\\nstraight before me on the table I saw....  In short, I saw a crumpled\\nblue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute\\nbefore.  It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other\\nin the flat.  So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table\\nat the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.\\n\\nWell!  I might have expected that she would do that.  Might I have\\nexpected it?  No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for\\nmy fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so.  I\\ncould not endure it.  A minute later I flew like a madman to dress,\\nflinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her.  She\\ncould not have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the\\nstreet.\\n\\nIt was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling\\nalmost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as\\nthough with a pillow.  There was no one in the street, no sound was to\\nbe heard.  The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer.  I\\nran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.\\n\\nWhere had she gone?  And why was I running after her?\\n\\nWhy?  To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet,\\nto entreat her forgiveness!  I longed for that, my whole breast was\\nbeing rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with\\nindifference. But--what for?  I thought.  Should I not begin to hate\\nher, perhaps, even tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today?\\nShould I give her happiness?  Had I not recognised that day, for the\\nhundredth time, what I was worth?  Should I not torture her?\\n\\nI stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered\\nthis.\\n\\n\"And will it not be better?\" I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,\\nstifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams.  \"Will it\\nnot be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for\\never? Resentment--why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and\\npainful consciousness!  Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and\\nhave exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never\\ndie in her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her--the\\nfeeling of insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h\\'m!\\n... perhaps, too, by forgiveness....  Will all that make things easier\\nfor her though? ...\"\\n\\nAnd, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which\\nis better--cheap happiness or exalted sufferings?  Well, which is\\nbetter?\\n\\nSo I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain\\nin my soul.  Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could\\nthere have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that\\nI should turn back half-way?  I never met Liza again and I have heard\\nnothing of her.  I will add, too, that I remained for a long time\\nafterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment\\nand hatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.\\n\\n      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\nEven now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory.\\nI have many evil memories now, but ... hadn\\'t I better end my \"Notes\"\\nhere?  I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I\\nhave felt ashamed all the time I\\'ve been writing this story; so it\\'s\\nhardly literature so much as a corrective punishment.  Why, to tell\\nlong stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally\\nrotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through\\ndivorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground world,\\nwould certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the\\ntraits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY gathered together here, and what\\nmatters most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all\\ndivorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less.\\nWe are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for\\nreal life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come\\nalmost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and\\nwe are all privately agreed that it is better in books.  And why do we\\nfuss and fume sometimes?  Why are we perverse and ask for something\\nelse?  We don\\'t know what ourselves.  It would be the worse for us if\\nour petulant prayers were answered.  Come, try, give any one of us, for\\ninstance, a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the\\nspheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you\\n... we should be begging to be under control again at once.  I know\\nthat you will very likely be angry with me for that, and will begin\\nshouting and stamping.  Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your\\nmiseries in your underground holes, and don\\'t dare to say all of\\nus--excuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that \"all of\\nus.\"  As for what concerns me in particular I have only in my life\\ncarried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and\\nwhat\\'s more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have\\nfound comfort in deceiving yourselves.  So that perhaps, after all,\\nthere is more life in me than in you.  Look into it more carefully!\\nWhy, we don\\'t even know what living means now, what it is, and what it\\nis called?  Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in\\nconfusion at once.  We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling\\nto, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise.\\nWe are oppressed at being men--men with a real individual body and\\nblood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive\\nto be some sort of impossible generalised man.  We are stillborn, and\\nfor generations past have been begotten, not by living fathers, and\\nthat suits us better and better.  We are developing a taste for it.\\nSoon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea.  But enough; I\\ndon\\'t want to write more from \"Underground.\"\\n\\n\\n[The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however.  He could not\\nrefrain from going on with them, but it seems to us that we may stop\\nhere.]\\n',\n",

It was my first novel; I\\nwrote it without any fixed plan, having no theory of art or philosophy\\nin my mind. I was at the age when one writes with one\\'s instincts, and\\nwhen reflection serves only to confirm our natural tendencies. Some\\npeople chose to see in the book a deliberate argument against marriage.\\nI was not so ambitious, and I was surprised to the last degree at all\\nthe fine things that the critics found to say concerning my subversive\\npurposes. Criticism is far too acute; that is what will cause its death.\\nIt never passes judgment ingenuously on what has been done ingenuously.\\nIt looks for noon at four o\\'clock, as the old women say, and must cause\\nmuch suffering to artists who care more for its decrees than they ought\\nto do.\\n\\nUnder all régimes and in all times there has been a race of critics,\\nwho, in contempt of their own talent, have fancied that it was their\\nduty to ply the trade of denouncers, of purveyors to the prosecuting\\nattorney\\'s office; extraordinary functions for men of letters to assume\\nwith regard to their confrères! The rigorous measures of government\\nagainst the press never satisfy these savage critics. They would have\\nthem directed not only against works but against persons as well, and,\\nif their advice were followed, some of us would be forbidden to write\\nanything whatsoever.\\n\\nAt the time that I wrote _Indiana_, the cry of Saint Simonism was raised\\non every pretext. Later they shouted all sorts of other things. Even now\\ncertain writers are forbidden to open their mouths, under pain of seeing\\nthe police agents of certain newspapers pounce upon their work and hale\\nthem before the police of the constituted powers. If a writer puts noble\\nsentiments in the mouth of a mechanic, it is an attack on the\\nbourgeoisie; if a girl who has gone astray is rehabilitated after\\nexpiating her sin, it is an attack on virtuous women; if an impostor\\nassumes titles of nobility, it is an attack on the patrician caste; if a\\nbully plays the swashbuckling soldier, it is an insult to the army; if a\\nwoman is maltreated by her husband, it is an argument in favor of\\npromiscuous love. And so with everything. Kindly brethren, devout and\\ngenerous critics! What a pity that no one thinks of creating a petty\\ncourt of literary inquisition in which you should be the torturers!\\nWould you be satisfied to tear the books to pieces and burn them at a\\nslow fire, and could you not, by your urgent representations, obtain\\npermission to give a little taste of the rack to those writers who\\npresume to have other gods than yours?\\n\\nThank God, I have forgotten the names of those who tried to discourage\\nme at my first appearance, and who, being unable to say that my first\\nattempt had fallen completely flat, tried to distort it into an\\nincendiary proclamation against the repose of society. I did not expect\\nso much honor, and I consider that I owe to those critics the thanks\\nwhich the hare proffered the frogs, imagining from their alarm that he\\nwas entitled to deem himself a very thunderbolt of war.\\n\\n\\nGEORGE SAND.\\n\\nNohant, May, 1852.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1832\\n\\n\\nIf certain pages of this book should incur the serious reproach of\\ntending toward novel beliefs, if unbending judges shall consider their\\ntone imprudent and perilous, I should be obliged to reply to the\\ncriticism that it does too much honor to a work of no importance; that,\\nin order to attack the great questions of social order, one must either\\nbe conscious of great strength of purpose or pride one\\'s self upon great\\ntalent, and that such presumption is altogether foreign to a very simple\\ntale, in which the author has invented almost nothing. If, in the course\\nof his task, he has happened to set forth the lamentations extorted from\\nhis characters by the social malady with which they were assailed; if he\\nhas not shrunk from recording their aspirations after a happier\\nexistence, let the blame be laid upon society for its inequalities, upon\\ndestiny for its caprices! The author is merely a mirror which reflects\\nthem, a machine which reverses their tracing, and he has no reason for\\nself-reproach if the impression is exact, if the reflection is true.\\n\\nConsider further that the narrator has not taken for text or devise a\\nfew shrieks of suffering and wrath scattered through the drama of human\\nlife. He does not claim to conceal serious instruction beneath the\\nexterior form of a tale; it is not his aim to lend a hand in\\nconstructing the edifice which a doubtful future is preparing for us and\\nto give a sly kick at that of the past which is crumbling away. He knows\\ntoo well that we live in an epoch of moral deterioration, wherein the\\nreason of mankind has need of curtains to soften the too bright glare\\nwhich dazzles it. If he had felt sufficiently learned to write a\\ngenuinely useful book, he would have toned down the truth, instead of\\npresenting it in its crude tints and with its startling effects. That\\nbook would have performed the functions of blue spectacles for weak\\neyes.\\n\\nHe does not abandon the idea of performing that honorable and laudable\\ntask some day; but, being still a young man, he simply tells you to-day\\nwhat he has seen, not presuming to draw his conclusions concerning the\\ngreat controversy between the future and the past, which perhaps no man\\nof the present generation is especially competent to do. Too\\nconscientious to conceal his doubts from you, but too timid to transform\\nthem into certainties, he relies upon your reflections and abstains from\\nweaving into the woof of his narrative preconceived opinions, judgments\\nall formed. He plies with exactitude his trade of narrator. He will tell\\nyou everything, even painful truths; but, if you should wrap him in the\\nphilosopher\\'s robe, you would find that he was exceedingly confused,\\nsimple story-teller that he is, whose mission is to amuse and not to\\ninstruct.\\n\\nEven were he more mature and more skilful, he would not dare to lay his\\nhand upon the great sores of dying civilization. One must be so sure of\\nbeing able to cure them when one ventures to probe them! He would much\\nprefer to arouse your interest in old discarded beliefs, in\\nold-fashioned, vanished forms of devotion, to employing his talent, if\\nhe had any, in blasting overturned altars. He knows, however, that, in\\nthese charitable times, a timorous conscience is despised by public\\nopinion as hypocritical reserve, just as, in the arts, a timid bearing\\nis sneered at as an absurd mannerism; but he knows also that there is\\nhonor, if not profit, in defending lost causes.\\n\\nTo him who should misunderstand the spirit of this book, such a\\nprofession of faith would sound like an anachronism. The narrator hopes\\nthat few auditors, after listening to his tale to the end, will deny the\\nmoral to be derived from the facts, a moral which triumphs there as in\\nall human affairs; it seemed to him, when he wrote the last line, that\\nhis conscience was clear. He flattered himself, in a word, that he had\\ndescribed social miseries without too much bitterness, human passions\\nwithout too much passion. He placed the mute under his strings when they\\nechoed too loudly; he tried to stifle certain notes of the soul which\\nshould remain mute, certain voices of the heart which cannot be awakened\\nwithout danger.\\n\\nPerhaps you will do him justice if you agree that the being who tries to\\nfree himself from his lawful curb is represented as very wretched\\nindeed, and the heart that rebels against the decrees of its destiny as\\nin sore distress. If he has not given the best imaginable rôle to that\\none of his characters who represents _the law_, if that one who\\nrepresents _opinion_ is even less cheerful, you will see a third\\nrepresenting _illusion_, who cruelly thwarts the vain hopes and\\nenterprises of passion. Lastly, you will see that, although he has not\\nstrewn rose-leaves on the ground where the law pens up our desires like\\na sheep\\'s appetite, he has scattered thistles along the roads which lead\\nus away from it.\\n\\nThese facts, it seems to me, are sufficient to protect this book from\\nthe reproach of immorality; but, if you absolutely insist that a novel\\nshould end like one of Marmontel\\'s tales, you will perhaps chide me on\\naccount of the last pages; you will think that I have done wrong in not\\ncasting into misery and destitution the character who has transgressed\\nthe laws of mankind through two volumes. In this regard, the author will\\nreply that before being moral he chose to be true; he will say again,\\nthat, feeling that he was too new to the trade to compose a\\nphilosophical treatise on the manner of enduring life, he has restricted\\nhimself to telling you the story of _Indiana_, a story of the human\\nheart, with its weaknesses, its passions, its rights and its wrongs, its\\ngood qualities and its evil qualities.\\n\\nIndiana, if you insist upon an explanation of every thing in the book,\\nis a type; she is woman, the feeble being whose mission it is to\\nrepresent _passions_ repressed, or, if you prefer, suppressed by _the\\nlaw_; she is desire at odds with necessity; she is love dashing her head\\nblindly against all the obstacles of civilization. But the serpent wears\\nout his teeth and breaks them in trying to gnaw a file; the powers of\\nthe soul become exhausted in trying to struggle against the positive\\nfacts of life. That is the conclusion you may draw from this tale, and\\nit was in that light that it was told to him who transmits it to you.\\n\\nBut despite these protestations the narrator anticipates reproaches.\\nSome upright souls, some honest men\\'s consciences will be alarmed\\nperhaps to see virtue so harsh, reason so downcast, opinion so unjust.\\nHe is dismayed at the prospect; for the thing that an author should fear\\nmore than anything in the world is the alienating from his works the\\nconfidence of good men, the awakening of an ominous sympathy in\\nembittered souls, the inflaming of the sores, already too painful, which\\nare made by the social yoke upon impatient and rebellious necks.\\n\\nThe success which is based upon an unworthy appeal to the passions of\\nthe age is the easiest to win, the least honorable to strive for. The\\nhistorian of _Indiana_ denies that he has ever dreamed of it; if he\\nthought that he had reached that result, he would destroy his book, even\\nthough he felt for it the artless fatherly affection which swaddles the\\nrickety offspring of these days of literary abortions.\\n\\nBut he hopes to justify himself by stating that he thought it better to\\nenforce his principles by real examples than by poetic fancies. He\\nbelieves that his tale, with the depressing atmosphere of frankness that\\nenvelopes it, may make an impression upon young and ardent brains. They\\nwill find it difficult to distrust a historian who forces his way\\nbrutally through the midst of facts, elbowing right and left, with no\\nmore regard for one camp than for the other. To make a cause odious or\\nabsurd is to persecute it, not to combat it. It may be that the whole\\nart of the novelist consists in interesting the culprits whom he wishes\\nto redeem, the wretched whom he wishes to cure, in their own story.\\n\\nIt would be giving overmuch importance to a work that is destined\\ndoubtless to attract very little notice, to seek to protect it against\\nevery sort of accusation. Therefore the author surrenders\\nunconditionally to the critics; a single charge seems to him too serious\\nto accept, and that is the charge that he has written a dangerous book.\\nHe would prefer to remain in a humble position forever to building his\\nreputation upon a ruined conscience. He will add a word therefore to\\nrepel the blame which he most dreads.\\n\\nRaymon, you will say, is society; egoism is substituted for morality and\\nreason. Raymon, the author will reply, is the false reason, the false\\nmorality by which society is governed; he is the man of honor as the\\nworld understands the phrase, because the world does not examine closely\\nenough to see everything. The good man you have beside Raymon; and you\\nwill not say that he is the enemy of order; for he sacrifices his\\nhappiness, he loses all thought of self before all questions of social\\norder.\\n\\nThen you will say that virtue is not rewarded with sufficient blowing of\\ntrumpets. Alas! the answer is that we no longer witness the triumph of\\nvirtue elsewhere than at the boulevard theatres. The author will tell\\nyou that he has undertaken to exhibit society to you, not as virtuous,\\nbut as necessary, and that honor has become as difficult as heroism in\\nthese days of moral degeneration. Do you think that this truth will\\ncause great souls to loathe honor? I think just the opposite.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1842\\n\\n\\nIn allowing the foregoing pages to be reprinted, I do not mean to imply\\nthat they form a clear and complete summary of the beliefs which I hold\\nto-day concerning the rights of society over individuals. I do it simply\\nbecause I regard opinions freely put forth in the past as something\\nsacred, which we should neither retract nor cry down nor attempt to\\ninterpret as our fancy directs. But to-day, having advanced on life\\'s\\nhighway and watched the horizon broaden around me, I deem it my duty to\\ntell the reader what I think of my book.\\n\\nWhen I wrote _Indiana_, I was young; I acted in obedience to feelings of\\ngreat strength and sincerity which overflowed thereafter in a series of\\nnovels, almost all of which were based on the same idea: the ill-defined\\nrelations between the sexes, attributable to the constitution of our\\nsociety. These novels were all more or less inveighed against by the\\ncritics, as making unwise assaults upon the institution of marriage.\\n_Indiana_, notwithstanding the narrowness of its scope and the ingenuous\\nuncertainty of its grasp, did not escape the indignation of several\\nself-styled serious minds, whom I was strongly disposed at that time to\\nbelieve upon their simple statement and to listen to with docility. But,\\nalthough my reasoning powers were developed hardly enough to write upon\\nso grave a subject, I was not so much of a child that I could not pass\\njudgment in my turn on the thoughts of those persons who passed judgment\\non mine. However simple-minded a man accused of crime may be and however\\nshrewd the magistrate, the accused has enough common-sense to know\\nwhether the magistrate\\'s sentence is equitable or inequitable, wise or\\nabsurd.\\n\\nCertain journalists of our day who set themselves up as representatives\\nand guardians of public morals--I know not by virtue of what\\nmission they act, since I know not by what faith they are\\ncommissioned--pronounced judgment pitilessly against my poor tale, and,\\nby representing it as an argument against social order, gave it an\\nimportance and a sort of echo which it would not otherwise have\\nobtained. They thereby imposed a very serious and weighty rôle upon a\\nyoung author hardly initiated in the most elementary social ideas, whose\\nwhole literary and philosophical baggage consisted of a little\\nimagination, courage and love of the truth. Sensitive to the reproofs\\nand almost grateful for the lessons which they were pleased to\\nadminister, he examined the arguments which arraigned the moral\\ncharacter of his thoughts before the bar of public opinion, and, by\\nvirtue of that examination, which he conducted entirely without pride,\\nhe gradually acquired convictions which were mere feelings at the outset\\nof his career and which to-day are fundamental principles.\\n\\nDuring ten years of investigations, of scruples, and of irresolution,\\noften painful but always sincere, shunning the rôle of pedagogue which\\nsome attributed to me to make me ridiculous, abhorring the imputation of\\npride and spleen with which others pursued me to make me odious,\\nproceeding according to the measure of my artistic faculties, to seek\\nthe synthesis of life by analyzing it, I related facts which have\\nsometimes been acknowledged to be plausible, and drew characters which\\nhave often been described as having been studied with care. I restricted\\nmyself to that, striving to establish my own conviction rather than to\\nshake other people\\'s, and saying to myself that, if I were mistaken,\\nsociety would find no lack of loud voices to overturn my arguments and\\nto repair by judicious answers the evil that my imprudent questions\\nmight have done. Numerous voices did, in fact, arise to put the public\\non its guard against the dangerous writer, but, as for the judicious\\nanswers, the public and the author are still awaiting them.\\n\\nA long while after I wrote the preface to _Indiana_ under the influence\\nof a remnant of respect for constituted society, I was still seeking to\\nsolve this insoluble problem: _the method of reconciling the welfare and\\nthe dignity of individuals oppressed by that same society without\\nmodifying society itself._ Leaning over the victims and mingling his\\ntears with theirs, making himself their interpreter with his readers,\\nbut, like a prudent advocate, not striving overmuch to palliate the\\nwrong-doing of his clients, and addressing himself to the clemency of\\nthe judges rather than to their austerity, the novelist is really the\\nadvocate of the abstract beings who represent our passions and our\\nsufferings before the tribunal of superior force and the jury of public\\nopinion. It is a task which has a gravity of its own beneath its trivial\\nexterior, and a task which it is exceedingly difficult to confine to its\\ntrue path, pestered as you are at every step by those who accuse you of\\nbeing too serious in respect to form and by those who accuse you of\\nbeing too frivolous in respect to substance.\\n\\nI do not flatter myself that I performed this task skilfully; but I am\\nsure that I attempted it in all seriousness, amid inward hesitations\\nwherein my conscience, sometimes dismayed by its ignorance of its\\nrights, sometimes inspired by a heart enamored of justice and truth,\\nmarched forward to its goal, without swerving too far from the straight\\nroad and without too many backward steps.\\n\\nTo enlighten the public as to this inward struggle by a series of\\nprefaces and discussions would have been a puerile method, wherein the\\nvanity of talking about one\\'s self would have taken too much space to\\nsuit me. I could but abstain from it as well as from touching too\\nhastily upon the points which were still obscure in my mind.\\nConservators called me too bold, innovators too timid. I confess that I\\nhad respect and sympathy for the past and the future alike, and in the\\nbattle I found no peace of mind until the day when I fully realized that\\nthe one should not be the violation and the annihilation of the other,\\nbut its continuation and development.\\n\\nAfter this novitiate of ten years, being initiated at last in broader\\nideas which I derived not from myself but from the philosophical\\nprogress which had taken place around me--and particularly from a few\\nvast intellects which I religiously questioned, and, generally speaking,\\nfrom the spectacle of the sufferings of my fellowmen,--I realized at\\nlast that, although I may have done well to distrust myself and to\\nhesitate to put forth my views at the epoch of ignorance and\\ninexperience when I wrote _Indiana_, my present duty is to congratulate\\nmyself on the bold utterances to which I allowed myself to be impelled\\nthen and afterwards; bold utterances for which I have been reproached so\\nbitterly, and which would have been bolder still had I known how\\nlegitimate and honest and sacred they were.\\n\\nTo-day therefore, having re-read the first novel of my youth with as\\nmuch severity and impartiality as if it were the work of another person,\\non the eve of giving it a publicity which it has not yet derived from\\nthe popular edition, having resolved beforehand not to retract--one\\nshould never retract what was said or done in good faith--but to condemn\\nmyself if I should discover that my former tendencies were mistaken or\\ndangerous, I find myself so entirely in accord with myself with respect\\nto the sentiment which dictated _Indiana_ and which would dictate it now\\nif I had that story to tell to-day for the first time, that I have not\\nchosen to change anything in it save a few ungrammatical sentences and\\nsome inappropriate words. Doubtless many more of the same sort remain,\\nand the literary merits of my writings I submit without reserve to the\\nanimadversions of the critics; I gladly accord to them all the\\ncompetence in that regard which I myself lack. That there is an\\nincontestable mass of talent in the daily press of the present day, I do\\nnot deny and I delight to acknowledge it. But that there are many\\nphilosophers and moralists in this array of polished writers, I do\\npositively deny, with due respect to those who have condemned me, and\\nwho will condemn me again on the first opportunity, from their lofty\\nplane of morality and philosophy.\\n\\nI repeat then, I wrote _Indiana_, and I was justified in writing it; I\\nyielded to an overpowering instinct of outcry and rebellion which God\\nhad implanted in me, God who makes nothing that is not of some use, even\\nthe most insignificant creatures, and who interposes in the most trivial\\nas well as in great causes. But what am I saying? is this cause that I\\nam defending so very trivial, pray? It is the cause of half of the human\\nrace, nay, of the whole human race; for the unhappiness of woman\\ninvolves that of man, as that of the slave involves that of the master,\\nand I strove to demonstrate it in _Indiana._ Some persons said that I\\nwas pleading the cause of an individual; as if, even assuming that I was\\ninspired by personal feeling, I was the only unhappy mortal in this\\npeaceful and radiant human race! So many cries of pain and sympathy\\nanswered mine that I know now what to think concerning the supreme\\nfelicity of my fellowman.\\n\\nI do not think that I have ever written anything under the influence of\\na selfish passion; I have never even thought of avoiding it. They who\\nhave read me without prejudice understand that I wrote _Indiana_ with a\\nfeeling, not deliberately reasoned out, to be sure, but a deep and\\ngenuine feeling that the laws which still govern woman\\'s existence in\\nwedlock, in the family and in society are unjust and barbarous. I had\\nnot to write a treatise on jurisprudence but to fight against public\\nopinion; for it is that which postpones or advances social reforms. The\\nwar will be long and bitter; but I am neither the first nor the last nor\\nthe only champion of so noble a cause, and I will defend it so long as\\nthe breath of life remains in my body.\\n\\nThis feeling which inspired me at the beginning I reasoned out and\\ndeveloped as it was combated and reproved. Unjust and malevolent critics\\ntaught me much more than I should have discovered in the calm of\\nimpunity. For this reason therefore I offer thanks to the bungling\\njudges who enlightened me. The motives that inspired their judgments\\ncast a bright light upon my mind and enveloped my conscience in a sense\\nof profound security. A sincere mind turns everything to advantage, and\\nfacts that would discourage vanity redouble the ardor of genuine\\ndevotion.\\n\\nLet no one look upon the reproof which, from the depths of a heart that\\nis to-day serious and tranquil, I have just addressed to the majority of\\njournalists of my time, as implying even a suggestion of protest against\\nthe right of censorship with which public morality invests the French\\npress. That criticism often ill performs and ill comprehends its mission\\nin the society of the present day, is evident to all; but that the\\nmission is in itself providential and sacred, no one can deny unless he\\nbe an atheist in the matter of progress, unless he be an enemy of the\\ntruth, a blasphemer of the future and an unworthy child of France!\\nLiberty of thought, liberty to write and to speak, blessed conquest of\\nthe human mind! what are the petty sufferings and the fleeting cares\\nengendered by thy errors or abuses compared to the infinite blessings\\nwhich thou hast in store for the world!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINDIANA\\n\\n\\nPART FIRST\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nOn a certain cool, rainy evening in autumn, in a small château in Brie,\\nthree pensive individuals were gravely occupied in watching the wood\\nburn on the hearth and the hands of the clock move slowly around the\\ndial. Two of these silent guests seemed to give way unreservedly to the\\nvague ennui that weighed upon them; but the third gave signs of open\\nrebellion: he fidgeted about on his seat, stifled half audibly divers\\nmelancholy yawns, and tapped the snapping sticks with the tongs, with a\\nmanifest intention of resisting the common enemy.\\n\\nThis person, who was much older than the other two, was the master of\\nthe house, Colonel Delmare, an old warrior on half-pay, once a very\\nhandsome man, now over-corpulent, with a bald head, gray moustache and\\nawe-inspiring eye; an excellent master before whom everybody trembled,\\nwife, servants, horses and dogs.\\n\\nAt last he left his chair, evidently vexed because he did not know how\\nto break the silence, and began to walk heavily up and down the whole\\nlength of the salon, without laying aside for an instant the rigidity\\nwhich characterizes all the movements of an ex-soldier, resting his\\nweight on his loins and turning the whole body at once, with the\\nunfailing self-satisfaction peculiar to the man of show and the model\\nofficer.\\n\\nBut the glorious days had passed, when Lieutenant Delmare inhaled\\ntriumph with the air of the camps; the retired officer, forgotten now by\\nan ungrateful country, was condemned to undergo all the consequences of\\nmarriage. He was the husband of a young and pretty wife, the proprietor\\nof a commodious manor with its appurtenances, and, furthermore, a\\nmanufacturer who had been fortunate in his undertakings; in consequence\\nwhereof the colonel was ill-humored, especially on the evening in\\nquestion; for it was very damp, and the colonel had rheumatism.\\n\\nHe paced gravely up and down his old salon, furnished in the style of\\nLouis XV., halting sometimes before a door surmounted by nude Cupids in\\nfresco, who led in chains of flowers well-bred fawns and good-natured\\nwild boars; sometimes before a panel overladen with paltry,\\nover-elaborated sculpture, whose tortuous vagaries and endless\\nintertwining the eye would have wearied itself to no purpose in\\nattempting to follow. But these vague and fleeting distractions did not\\nprevent the colonel, whenever he turned about, from casting a keen and\\nsearching glance at the two companions of his silent vigil, resting upon\\nthem alternately that watchful eye which for three years past had been\\nstanding guard over a fragile and priceless treasure, his wife.\\n\\nFor his wife was nineteen years of age; and if you had seen her buried\\nunder the mantel of that huge fire-place of white marble inlaid with\\nburnished copper; if you had seen her, slender, pale, depressed, with\\nher elbow resting on her knee, a mere child in that ancient household,\\nbeside that old husband, like a flower of yesterday that had bloomed in\\na gothic vase, you would have pitied Colonel Delmare\\'s wife, and the\\ncolonel even more perhaps than his wife.\\n\\nThe third occupant of this lonely house was also sitting under the same\\nmantel, at the other end of the burning log. He was a man in all the\\nstrength and all the bloom of youth, whose glowing cheeks, abundant\\ngolden hair and full whiskers presented a striking contrast to the\\ngrizzly hair, weather-beaten complexion and harsh countenance of the\\nmaster of the house; but the least _artistic_ of men would none the less\\nhave preferred Monsieur Delmare\\'s harsh and stern expression to the\\nyounger man\\'s regular but insipid features. The bloated face carved in\\nrelief on the sheet of iron that formed the back of the fire-place, with\\nits eye fixed constantly on the burning logs, was less monotonous\\nperhaps than the pink and white fair-haired character in this narrative,\\nabsorbed in like contemplation. However, his strong and supple figure,\\nthe clean-cut outline of his brown eyebrows, the polished whiteness of\\nhis forehead, the tranquil expression of his limpid eyes, the beauty of\\nhis hands, and even the rigorously correct elegance of his hunting\\ncostume, would have caused him to be considered a very comely _cavalier_\\nin the eyes of any woman who had conceived a passion for the so-called\\n_philosophic_ tastes of another century. But perhaps Monsieur Delmare\\'s\\nyoung and timid wife had never as yet examined a man with her eyes;\\nperhaps there was an entire absence of sympathy between that pale and\\nunhappy woman and that sound sleeper and hearty eater. Certain it is\\nthat the conjugal Argus wearied his hawklike eye without detecting a\\nglance, a breath, a palpitation, between these two very dissimilar\\nbeings. Thereupon, being assured that he had not the slightest pretext\\nfor jealousy to occupy his mind, he relapsed into a state of depression\\nmore profound than before, and abruptly plunged his hands into his\\npockets.\\n\\nThe only cheerful and attractive face in the group was that of a\\nbeautiful hunting dog, of the large breed of pointers, whose head was\\nresting on the knees of the younger man. She was remarkable by reason of\\nher long body, her powerful hairy legs, her muzzle, slender as a fox\\'s,\\nand her intelligent face, covered with disheveled hair, through which\\ntwo great tawny eyes shone like topazes. Those dog\\'s eyes, so fierce and\\nthreatening during the chase, had at that moment an indefinable\\nexpression of affectionate melancholy; and when her master, the object\\nof that instinctive love, sometimes so superior to the deliberate\\naffection of man, ran his fingers through the beautiful creature\\'s silky\\nsilver locks, her eyes sparkled with pleasure, while her long tail swept\\nthe hearth in regular cadence, and scattered the ashes over the inlaid\\nfloor.\\n\\nIt was a fitting subject for Rembrandt\\'s brush, that interior, dimly\\nlighted by the fire on the hearth. At intervals fugitive white gleams\\nlighted up the room and the faces, then, changing to the red tint of the\\nembers, gradually died away; the gloom of the salon varying as the\\nfitful gleams grew more or less dull. Each time that Monsieur Delmare\\npassed in front of the fire, he suddenly appeared, like a ghost, then\\nvanished in the mysterious depths of the salon. Strips of gilding stood\\nforth in the light now and then on the oval frames, adorned with wreaths\\nand medallions and fillets of wood, on furniture, inlaid with ebony and\\ncopper, and even on the jagged cornices of the wainscoting. But when a\\nbrand went out, resigning its brilliancy to some other blazing point,\\nthe objects which had been in the light a moment before withdrew into\\nthe shadow, and other projections stood forth from the obscurity. Thus\\none could have grasped in due time all the details of the picture, from\\nthe console supported by three huge gilded tritons, to the frescoed\\nceiling, representing a sky studded with stars and clouds, and to the\\nheavy hangings of crimson damask, with long tassels, which shimmered\\nlike satin, their ample folds seeming to sway back and forth as they\\nreflected the flickering light.\\n\\nOne would have said, from the immobility of the two figures in bold\\nrelief before the fire, that they feared to disturb the immobility of\\nthe scene; that they had been turned to stone where they sat, like the\\nheroes of a fairy tale, and that the slightest word or movement would\\nbring the walls of an imaginary city crumbling about their ears. And the\\ndark-browed master, who alone broke the silence and the shadow with his\\nregular tread, seemed a magician who held them under a spell.\\n\\nAt last the dog, having obtained a smile from her master, yielded to the\\nmagnetic power which the eye of man exerts over that of the lower\\nanimals. She uttered a low whine of timid affection and placed her fore\\npaws on her beloved\\'s shoulders with inimitable ease and grace of\\nmovement.\\n\\n\"Down, Ophelia, down!\"\\n\\nAnd the young man reproved the docile creature sternly in English,\\nwhereupon she crawled toward Madame Delmare, shamefaced and repentant,\\nas if to implore her protection. But Madame Delmare did not emerge from\\nher reverie, and allowed Ophelia\\'s head to rest on her two white hands,\\nas they lay clasped on her knee, without bestowing a caress upon her.\\n\\n\"Has that dog taken up her quarters in the salon for good?\" said the\\ncolonel, secretly well-pleased to find a pretext for an outburst of\\nill-humor, to pass the time. \"Be off to your kennel, Ophelia! Come, out\\nwith you, you stupid beast!\"\\n\\nIf anyone had been watching Madame Delmare closely he could have\\ndivined, in that trivial and commonplace incident of her private life,\\nthe painful secret of her whole existence. An imperceptible shudder ran\\nover her body, and her hands, in which she unconsciously held the\\nfavorite animal\\'s head, closed nervously around her rough, hairy neck,\\nas if to detain her and protect her. Whereupon Monsieur Delmare, drawing\\nhis hunting-crop from the pocket of his jacket, walked with a\\nthreatening air toward poor Ophelia, who crouched at his feet, closing\\nher eyes, and whining with grief and fear in anticipation. Madame\\nDelmare became even paler than usual; her bosom heaved convulsively,\\nand, turning her great blue eyes upon her husband with an indescribable\\nexpression of terror, she said:\\n\\n\"In pity\\'s name, monsieur, do not kill her!\"\\n\\nThese few words gave the colonel a shock. A feeling of chagrin took the\\nplace of his angry impulse.\\n\\n\"That, madame, is a reproof which I understand very well,\" he said, \"and\\nwhich you have never spared me since the day that I killed your spaniel\\nin a moment of passion while hunting. He was a great loss, was he not? A\\ndog that was forever forcing the hunting and rushing after the game!\\nWhose patience would he not have exhausted? Indeed, you were not nearly\\nso fond of him until he was dead; before that you paid little attention\\nto him; but now that he gives you a pretext for blaming me--\"\\n\\n\"Have I ever reproached you?\" said Madame Delmare in the gentle tone\\nwhich we adopt from a generous impulse with those we love, and from\\nself-esteem with those whom we do not love.\\n\\n\"I did not say that you had,\" rejoined the colonel in a half-paternal,\\nhalf-conjugal tone; \"but the tears of some women contain bitterer\\nreproaches than the fiercest imprecations of others. _Morbleu!_ madame,\\nyou know perfectly well that I hate to see people weeping about me.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think that you ever see me weep.\"\\n\\n\"Even so! don\\'t I constantly see you with red eyes? On my word, that\\'s\\neven worse!\"\\n\\nDuring this conjugal colloquy the young man had risen and put Ophelia\\nout of the room with the greatest tranquillity; then he returned to his\\nseat opposite Madame Delmare after lighting a candle and placing it on\\nthe chimney-piece.\\n\\nThis act, dictated purely by chance, exerted a sudden influence upon\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s frame of mind. As soon as the light of the candle,\\nwhich was more uniform and steadier than that of the fire, fell upon his\\nwife, he observed the symptoms of suffering and general prostration\\nwhich were manifest that evening in her whole person: in her weary\\nattitude, in the long brown hair falling over her emaciated cheeks and\\nin the purple rings beneath her dull, inflamed eyes. He took several\\nturns up and down the room, then returned to his wife and, suddenly\\nchanging his tone:\\n\\n\"How do you feel to-day, Indiana?\" he said, with the stupidity of a man\\nwhose heart and temperament are rarely in accord.\\n\\n\"About as usual, thank you,\" she replied, with no sign of surprise or\\ndispleasure.\\n\\n\"\\'As usual\\' is no answer at all, or rather it\\'s a woman\\'s answer; a\\nNorman answer, that means neither yes nor no, neither well nor ill.\"\\n\\n\"Very good; I am neither well nor ill.\"\\n\\n\"I say that you lie,\" he retorted with renewed roughness; \"I know that\\nyou are not well; you have told Sir Ralph here that you are not. Tell\\nme, isn\\'t that the truth? Did she not tell you so, Monsieur Ralph?\"\\n\\n\"She did,\" replied the phlegmatic individual addressed, paying no heed\\nto the reproachful glance which Indiana bestowed upon him.\\n\\nAt that moment a fourth person entered the room: it was the factotum of\\nthe household, formerly a sergeant in Monsieur Delmare\\'s regiment.\\n\\nHe explained briefly to Monsieur Delmare that he had his reasons for\\nbelieving that charcoal thieves had been in the park the last few nights\\nat the same hour, and that he had come to ask for a gun to take with him\\nin making his nightly round before locking the gates. Monsieur Delmare,\\nscenting powder in the adventure, at once took down his fowling-piece,\\ngave Lelièvre another, and started to leave the room.\\n\\n\"What!\" said Madame Delmare in dismay, \"you would kill a poor peasant on\\naccount of a few bags of charcoal?\"\\n\\n\"I will shoot down like a dog,\" retorted Delmare, irritated by this\\nremonstrance, \"any man whom I find prowling around my premises at night.\\nIf you knew the law, madame, you would know that it authorizes me to do\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"It is a horrible law,\" said Indiana, warmly. But she quickly repressed\\nthis impulse and added in a lower tone: \"But your rheumatism? You forget\\nthat it rains, and that you will suffer for it to-morrow if you go out\\nto-night.\"\\n\\n\"You are terribly afraid that you will have to nurse your old husband,\"\\nreplied Delmare, impatiently opening the door.\\n\\nAnd he left the room, still muttering about his age and his wife.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nThe two personages whom we have mentioned, Indiana Delmare and Sir\\nRalph, or, if you prefer, Monsieur Rodolphe Brown, continued to face\\neach other, as calm and cold as if the husband were standing between\\nthem. The Englishman had no idea of justifying himself, and Madame\\nDelmare realized that she had no serious grounds for reproaching him,\\nfor he had spoken with no evil intention. At last, making an effort, she\\nbroke the silence and upbraided him mildly.\\n\\n\"That was not well done of you, my dear Ralph,\" she said. \"I had\\nforbidden you to repeat the words that I let slip in a moment of pain,\\nand Monsieur Delmare is the last person in the world whom I should want\\ntold of my trouble.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand you, my dear,\" Sir Ralph replied; \"you are ill and\\nyou refuse to take care of yourself. I had to choose between the chance\\nof losing you and the necessity of letting your husband know.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Madame Delmare, with a sad smile, \"and you decided to\\n_notify the authorities._\"\\n\\n\"You are wrong, you are wrong, on my word, to allow yourself to inveigh\\nso against the colonel; he is a man of honor, a worthy man.\"\\n\\n\"And who says that he\\'s not, Sir Ralph?\"\\n\\n\"Why, you do, without meaning to. Your depression, your ailing\\ncondition, and, as he himself observes, your red eyes, tell everybody\\nevery hour in the day that you are not happy.\"\\n\\n\"Hush, Sir Ralph, you go too far. I have never given you permission to\\nfind out so much.\"\\n\\n\"I anger you, I see; but what would you have! I am not clever; I am not\\nacquainted with the subtle distinctions of your language, and then, too,\\nI resemble your husband in many ways. Like him I am utterly in the dark\\nas to what a man must say to a woman, either in English or in French, to\\nconsole her. Another man would have conveyed to your mind, without\\nputting it in words, the idea that I have just expressed so awkwardly;\\nhe would have had the art to insinuate himself into your confidence\\nwithout allowing you to detect his progress, and perhaps he would have\\nsucceeded in affording some relief to your heart, which puts fetters on\\nitself and locks itself up before me. This is not the first time that I\\nhave noticed how much more influence words have upon women than ideas,\\nespecially in France. Women more than----\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you have a profound contempt for women, my dear Ralph. I am alone\\nhere against two of you, so I must make up my mind never to be right.\"\\n\\n\"Put us in the wrong, my dear cousin, by recovering your health, your\\ngood spirits, your bloom, your animation of the old days; remember Ile\\nBourbon and that delightful retreat of ours, Bernica, and our happy\\nchildhood, and our friendship, which is as old as you are yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I remember my father, too,\" said Indiana, dwelling sadly upon the words\\nand placing her hand in Sir Ralph\\'s.\\n\\nThey relapsed into profound silence.\\n\\n\"Indiana,\" said Ralph, after a pause, \"happiness is always within our\\nreach. Often one has only to put out his hand to grasp it. What do you\\nlack? You have modest competence, which is preferable to great wealth,\\nan excellent husband, who loves you with all his heart, and, I dare to\\nassert, a sincere and devoted friend.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare pressed Sir Ralph\\'s hand faintly, but she did not change\\nher attitude; her head still hung forward on her breast and her\\ntear-dimmed eyes were fixed on the magic effects produced by the embers.\\n\\n\"Your depression, my dear friend,\" continued Sir Ralph, \"is due purely\\nto physical causes; which one of us can escape disappointment, vexation?\\nLook below you and you will see people who envy you, and with good\\nreason. Man is so constituted that he always aspires to what he has\\nnot.\"\\n\\nI spare you a multitude of other commonplaces which the excellent Sir\\nRalph put forth in a tone as monotonous and sluggish as his thoughts. It\\nwas not that Sir Ralph was a fool, but he was altogether out of his\\nelement. He lacked neither common sense nor shrewdness; but the rôle of\\nconsoler of women was, as he himself acknowledged, beyond his capacity.\\nAnd this man had so little comprehension of another\\'s grief, that with\\nthe best possible disposition to furnish a remedy, he could not touch it\\nwithout inflaming it. He was so conscious of his awkwardness that he\\nrarely ventured to take notice of his friend\\'s sorrows; and on this\\noccasion he made superhuman efforts to perform what he considered the\\nmost painful duty of friendship.\\n\\nWhen he saw that Madame Delmare was obliged to make an effort to listen\\nto him, he held his peace, and naught could be heard save the\\ninnumerable little voices whispering in the burning wood, the plaintive\\nsong of the log as it becomes heated and swells, the crackling of the\\nbark as it curls before breaking, and the faint phosphorescent\\nexplosions of the alburnum, which emits a bluish flame. From time to\\ntime the baying of a dog mingled with the whistling of the wind through\\nthe cracks of the door and the beating of the rain against the\\nwindowpanes. That evening was one of the saddest that Madame Delmare had\\nyet passed in her little manor-house in Brie.\\n\\nMoreover, an indefinable vague feeling of suspense weighed upon that\\nimpressionable soul and its delicate fibres. Weak creatures live on\\nalarms and presentiments. Madame Delmare had all the superstitions of a\\nnervous, sickly Creole; certain nocturnal sounds, certain phases of the\\nmoon were to her unfailing presages of specific events, of impending\\nmisfortunes, and the night spoke to that dreamy, melancholy creature a\\nlanguage full of mysteries and phantoms which she alone could understand\\nand translate according to her fears and her sufferings.\\n\\n\"You will say again that I am mad,\" she said, withdrawing her hand,\\nwhich Sir Ralph still held, \"but some disaster, I don\\'t know what, is\\npreparing to fall upon us. Some danger is impending over\\nsomeone--myself, no doubt--but, look you, Ralph, I feel intensely\\nagitated, as at the approach of a great crisis in my destiny. I am\\nafraid,\" she added, with a shudder, \"I feel faint.\"\\n\\nAnd her lips became as white as her cheeks. Sir Ralph, terrified, not by\\nMadame Delmare\\'s presentiments, which he looked upon as symptoms of\\nextreme mental exhaustion, but by her deathly pallor, pulled the\\nbell-rope violently to summon assistance. No one came, and as Indiana\\ngrew weaker and weaker, Sir Ralph, more alarmed in proportion, moved her\\naway from the fire, deposited her in a reclining chair, and ran through\\nthe house at random, calling the servants, looking for water or salts,\\nfinding nothing, breaking all the bell-ropes, losing his way in the\\nlabyrinth of dark rooms, and wringing his hands with impatience and\\nanger against himself.\\n\\nAt last it occurred to him to open the glass door that led into the\\npark, and to call alternately Lelièvre and Noun, Madame Delmare\\'s\\nCreole maid.\\n\\nA few moments later Noun appeared from one of the dark paths in the\\npark, and hastily inquired if Madame Delmare were worse than usual.\\n\\n\"She is really ill,\" replied Sir Ralph.\\n\\nThey returned to the salon and devoted themselves to the task of\\nrestoring the unconscious Madame Delmare, one with all the ardor of\\nuseless and awkward zeal, the other with the skill and efficacy of\\nwomanly affection.\\n\\nNoun was Madame Delmare\\'s foster-sister; the two young women had been\\nbrought up together and loved each other dearly. Noun was tall and\\nstrong, glowing with health, active, alert, overflowing with ardent,\\npassionate creole blood; and she far outshone with her resplendent\\nbeauty the frail and pallid charms of Madame Delmare; but the tenderness\\nof their hearts and the strength of their attachment killed every\\nfeeling of feminine rivalry.\\n\\nWhen Madame Delmare recovered consciousness, the first thing that she\\nobserved was the unusual expression of her maid\\'s features, the damp and\\ndisordered condition of her hair and the excitement which was manifest\\nin her every movement.\\n\\n\"Courage, my poor child,\" she said kindly; \"my illness is more\\ndisastrous to you than to myself. Why, Noun, you are the one to take\\ncare of yourself; you are growing thin and weeping as if it were not\\nyour destiny to live; dear Noun, life is so bright and fair before you!\"\\n\\nNoun pressed Madame Delmare\\'s hand to her lips effusively, and said, in\\na sort of frenzy, glancing wildly about the room:\\n\\n\"_Mon Dieu!_ madame, do you know why Monsieur Delmare is in the park?\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" echoed Indiana, losing instantly the faint flush that had\\nreappeared on her cheeks. \"Wait a moment--I don\\'t know--You frighten me!\\nWhat is the matter, pray?\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur Delmare declares that there are thieves in the park,\" replied\\nNoun in a broken voice. \"He is making the rounds with Lelièvre, both\\narmed with guns.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Indiana, apparently expecting some shocking news.\\n\\n\"Why, madame,\" rejoined Noun, clasping her hands frantically, \"isn\\'t it\\nhorrible to think that they are going to kill a man?\"\\n\\n\"Kill a man!\" cried Madame Delmare, springing to her feet with the\\nterrified credulity of a child frightened by it\\'s nurse\\'s tales.\\n\\n\"Ah! yes, they will kill him,\" said Noun, stifling her sobs.\\n\\n\"These two women are mad,\" thought Sir Ralph, who was watching this\\nstrange scene with a bewildered air. \"Indeed,\" he added mentally, \"all\\nwomen are.\"\\n\\n\"But why do you say that, Noun,\" continued Madame Delmare; \"do you\\nbelieve that there are any thieves there?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if they were really thieves! but some poor peasant perhaps, who has\\ncome to pick up a handful of wood for his family!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that would be ghastly, as you say! But it is not probable; right\\nat the entrance to Fontainebleau forest, when it is so easy to steal\\nwood there, nobody would take the risk of a park enclosed by walls. Bah!\\nMonsieur Delmare won\\'t find anybody in the park, so don\\'t you be\\nafraid.\"\\n\\n\\n[Illustration 02:_MADAME DELMARE DRESSES DE\\nRAMIÈRES WOUNDS._\\n_A mattress was placed on several chairs, and\\nIndiana, assisted by her women, busied herself in\\ndressing the wounded hand, while Sir Ralph, who\\nhad some surgical knowledge, drew a large quantity\\nof blood from him._]\\n\\n\\nBut Noun was not listening; she walked from the window to her mistress\\'s\\nchair, her ears strained to catch the slightest sound; she seemed torn\\nbetween the longing to run after Monsieur Delmare and the desire to\\nremain with the invalid.\\n\\nHer anxiety seemed so strange, so uncalled-for to Monsieur Brown, that\\nhe laid aside his customary mildness of manner, and said, grasping her\\narm roughly:\\n\\n\"Have you lost your wits altogether? don\\'t you see that you frighten\\nyour mistress and that your absurd alarms have a disastrous effect upon\\nher?\"\\n\\nNoun did not hear him; she had turned her eyes upon her mistress, who\\nhad just started on her chair as if the concussion of the air had\\nimparted an electric shock to her senses. Almost at the same instant the\\nreport of a gun shook the windows of the salon, and Noun fell upon her\\nknees.\\n\\n\"What miserable woman\\'s terrors!\" cried Sir Ralph, worn out by their\\nemotion; \"in a moment a dead rabbit will be brought to you in triumph,\\nand you will laugh at yourselves.\"\\n\\n\"No, Ralph,\" said Madame Delmare, walking with a firm step toward the\\ndoor, \"I tell you that human blood has been shed.\"\\n\\nNoun uttered a piercing shriek and fell upon her face.\\n\\nThe next moment they heard Lelièvre\\'s voice in the park:\\n\\n\"He\\'s there! he\\'s there! Well aimed, my colonel! the brigand is down!\"\\n\\nSir Ralph began to be excited. He followed Madame Delmare. A few moments\\nlater a man covered with blood and giving no sign of life was brought\\nunder the peristyle.\\n\\n\"Not so much noise! less shrieking!\" said the colonel with rough gayety\\nto the terrified servants who crowded around the wounded man; \"this is\\nonly a joke; my gun was loaded with nothing but salt. Indeed I don\\'t\\nthink I touched him; he fell from fright.\"\\n\\n\"But what about this blood, monsieur?\" said Madame Delmare in a\\nprofoundly reproachful tone, \"was it fear that caused it to flow?\"\\n\\n\"Why are you here, madame?\" cried Monsieur Delmare, \"what are you doing\\nhere?\"\\n\\n\"I have come to repair the harm that you have done, as it is my duty to\\ndo,\" replied Madame Delmare coldly.\\n\\nShe walked up to the wounded man with a courage of which no one of the\\npersons present had as yet felt capable, and held a light to his face.\\nThereupon, instead of the plebeian features and garments which they\\nexpected to see, they discovered a young man with noble features and\\nfashionably dressed, albeit in hunting costume. He had a trifling wound\\non one hand, but his torn clothes and his swoon indicated a serious\\nfall.\\n\\n\"I should say as much!\" said Lelièvre; \"he fell from a height of twenty\\nfeet. He was just putting his leg over the wall when the colonel fired,\\nand a few grains of small shot or salt in the right hand prevented his\\ngetting a hold. The fact is, I saw him fall, and when he got to the\\nbottom he wasn\\'t thinking much about running away, poor devil!\"\\n\\n\"Would any one believe,\" said one of the female servants, \"that a man so\\nnicely dressed would amuse himself by stealing?\"\\n\\n\"And his pockets are full of money!\" said another, who had unbuttoned\\nthe supposed thief\\'s waistcoat.\\n\\n\"It is very strange,\" said the colonel, gazing, not without emotion, at\\nthe man stretched out before him. \"If the man is dead it\\'s not my fault;\\nexamine his hand, madame, and see if you can find a particle of lead in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I prefer to believe you, monsieur,\" replied Madame Delmare, who, with a\\nself-possession and moral courage of which no one would have deemed her\\ncapable, was closely scrutinizing his pulse and the arteries of his\\nneck. \"Certainly,\" she added, \"he is not dead, and he requires speedy\\nattention. The man hasn\\'t the appearance of a thief and perhaps he\\ndeserves our care; even if he does not deserve it, our duty calls upon\\nus women to care for him none the less.\"\\n\\nThereupon Madame Delmare ordered the wounded man to be carried to the\\nbilliard room, which was nearest. A mattress was placed on several\\nchairs, and Indiana, assisted by her women, busied herself in dressing\\nthe wounded hand, while Sir Ralph, who had some surgical knowledge, drew\\na large quantity of blood from him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the colonel, much embarrassed, found himself in the position\\nof a man who has shown more ill-temper than he intended to show. He felt\\nthe necessity of justifying himself in the eyes of the others, or rather\\nof making them justify him in his own eyes. So he had remained under the\\nperistyle, surrounded by his servants, and indulging with them in the\\nexcited, prolix and perfectly useless disquisitions which are always\\nforthcoming after the event. Lelièvre had already explained twenty\\ntimes, with the most minute details, the shot, the fall and its results,\\nwhile the colonel, who had recovered his good-nature among his own\\npeople, according to his custom, after giving way to his anger,\\nimpeached the purposes of a man who entered private property in the\\nnight-time over the wall. Every one agreed with the master, when the\\ngardener, quietly leading him aside, assured him that the thief was the\\nliving image of a young land-owner who had recently settled in the\\nneighborhood, and whom he had seen talking with Mademoiselle Noun three\\ndays before at the rustic fête at Rubelles.\\n\\nThis information gave a different turn to Monsieur Delmare\\'s ideas; on\\nhis ample forehead, bald and glistening, appeared a huge swollen vein,\\nwhich was always the precursor of a tempest.\\n\\n\"Morbleu!\" he said, clenching his fists, \"Madame Delmare takes a deal of\\ninterest in this puppy, who sneaks into my park over the wall!\"\\n\\nAnd he entered the billiard room, pale and trembling with wrath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\n\"You may be reassured, monsieur,\" said Indiana; \"the man you killed will\\nbe quite well in a few days; at least we hope so, although he is not yet\\nable to talk.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the question, madame,\" said the colonel, in a voice that\\ntrembled with suppressed passion; \"I insist upon knowing the name of\\nthis interesting patient of yours, and how it came about that he mistook\\nthe wall of my park for the avenue to my house.\"\\n\\n\"I have absolutely no idea,\" replied Madame Delmare with such a cold and\\nhaughty air that her redoubtable spouse was bewildered for an instant.\\n\\nBut his jealous suspicions soon regained the upper hand.\\n\\n\"I shall find out, madame,\" he said in an undertone; \"you may be sure\\nthat I shall find out.\"\\n\\nThereupon, as Madame Delmare pretended not to notice his rage and\\ncontinued her attentions to the wounded man, he left the room, in order\\nnot to explode before the women, and recalled the gardener.\\n\\n\"What is the name of the man who, you say, resembles our prowler?\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur de Ramière. It is he who has just bought Monsieur de Cercy\\'s\\nlittle English house.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of man is he? a nobleman, a fop, a fine gentleman?\"\\n\\n\"A fine gentleman, monsieur; noble, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" rejoined the colonel with emphasis. \"Monsieur de\\nRamière! Tell me, Louis,\" he added, lowering his voice, \"have you ever\\nseen this fop prowling about here?\"\\n\\n\"Last night, monsieur,\" Louis replied, with an embarrassed air, \"I\\ncertainly saw--as to its being a fop, I can\\'t say, but it was a man,\\nsure enough.\"\\n\\n\"And you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"As plainly as I see you, under the windows of the orangery.\"\\n\\n\"And you didn\\'t fall upon him with the handle of your shovel?\"\\n\\n\"I was just going to do it, monsieur; but I saw a woman in white come\\nout of the orangery and go to meet him. At that I said to myself:\\n\\'Perhaps it\\'s monsieur and madame, who have taken a fancy to walk a bit\\nbefore daybreak;\\' and I went back to bed. But this morning I heard\\nLelièvre talking about a thief whose tracks he had seen in the park,\\nand I said to myself: \\'There\\'s something under this.\\'\"\\n\\n\"And why didn\\'t you tell me immediately, stupid?\"\\n\\n\"_Dame!_ monsieur, there are some things in life that are _so\\ndelicate!_\"\\n\\n\"I understand--you presume to have doubts. You are a fool; if you ever\\nhave another insolent idea of this sort I\\'ll cut off your ears. I know\\nvery well who the thief is and why he came into the garden. I have put\\nall these questions to you simply to find out what care you take of your\\norangery. Remember that I have some rare plants there that madame sets\\ngreat store by, and that there are collectors who are insane enough to\\nrob their neighbors\\' hothouses; it was I whom you saw last night with\\nMadame Delmare.\"\\n\\nAnd the poor colonel walked away, more tormented, more exasperated than\\nbefore, leaving his gardener far from convinced that there are\\nhorticulturists fanatical enough to risk a bullet in order to purloin a\\nshoot or a cutting.\\n\\nMonsieur Delmare returned to the billiard-room and, paying no heed to\\nthe symptoms of returning consciousness which the wounded man displayed\\nat last, he was preparing to search the pockets of his jacket which lay\\non a chair, when he put out his hand and said in a faint voice:\\n\\n\"You wish to know who I am, monsieur, but it is useless. I will tell you\\nwhen we are alone. Until then spare me the embarrassment of making\\nmyself known in my present disagreeable and absurd position.\"\\n\\n\"It is a great pity in truth!\" retorted the colonel sourly; \"but I\\nconfess that I hardly appreciate it. However, as I trust that we shall\\nmeet again, and alone, I consent to defer an acquaintance until then.\\nMeanwhile will you kindly tell me where I shall have you taken.\"\\n\\n\"To the public house in the nearest village, if you please.\"\\n\\n\"But monsieur is no condition to be moved, is he, Ralph?\" said Madame\\nDelmare hastily.\\n\\n\"Monsieur\\'s condition affects you far too much, madame,\" said the\\ncolonel. \"Leave the room, all of you,\" he said to the women in\\nattendance. \"Monsieur feels better, and he will find strength now to\\nexplain his presence on my premises.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" rejoined the wounded man, \"and I beg all those who have\\nbeen kind enough to bestow any care upon me to listen to my\\nacknowledgment of my misconduct. I feel that is of much importance that\\nthere should be no misunderstanding here of my motives, and it is of\\nimportance to myself that I should not be deemed what I am not. Let me\\ntell you then what rascally scheme brought me to your park. You have\\ninstalled, monsieur, by methods of extreme simplicity, known to you\\nalone, a factory which is immeasurably superior to all similar factories\\nin the province, both in respect to its processes and its product. My\\nbrother owns a very similar establishment in the south of France, but\\nthe cost of running it is enormous. His business was approaching\\nshipwreck when I learned of the success of your venture; whereupon I\\ndetermined to come and ask you to give me advice on certain points,--a\\ngenerous service which could not possibly injure your own interests, as\\nmy brother\\'s output is of an entirely different nature from yours. But\\nthe gate of your English garden was rigorously closed to me; and when I\\nasked for an interview with you, I was told that you would not even\\nallow me to look over your establishment. Repelled by these discourteous\\nrefusals, I determined to save my brother\\'s life and honor even at the\\nperil of my own; I entered your premises at night by scaling the wall,\\nand tried to obtain entrance to the factory in order to examine the\\nmachinery. I had determined to hide in a corner; to bribe your workmen,\\nto steal your secret,--in a word, to enable an honest man to profit by\\nit without injuring you. Such was my crime. Now, monsieur, if you demand\\nany other reparation than that which you have just taken, I am ready to\\noffer it to you as soon as I am strong enough; indeed, I may perhaps\\ndemand it.\"\\n\\n\"I think that we should cry quits, monsieur,\" replied the colonel, half\\nrelieved from a great anxiety. \"Take notice, all of you, of the\\nexplanation monsieur has given me. I am over-avenged, assuming that I\\nrequire any revenge. Go now and leave us to discuss my profitable\\nbusiness operations.\"\\n\\nThe servants left the room; but they alone were deceived by this\\nreconciliation. The wounded man, weakened by his long speech, was not\\ncapable of appreciating the tone of the colonel\\'s last words. He fell\\nback into Madame Delmare\\'s arms and lost consciousness a second time.\\nShe leaned over him, not deigning to raise her eyes to her angry\\nhusband, and the two strikingly contrasted faces of Monsieur Delmare and\\nMonsieur Brown, the one pale and distorted by anger, the other calm and\\nexpressionless as usual, questioned each other in silence.\\n\\nMonsieur Delmare did not need to say a word to make himself understood;\\nhowever he drew Sir Ralph aside and said, crushing his fingers in his\\ngrasp:\\n\\n\"This is an admirably woven intrigue, my friend. I am delighted,\\nperfectly delighted with this young fellow\\'s quick wit, which enabled\\nhim to save my honor in the eyes of my servants. But, _mordieu!_ he\\nshall pay dear for the insult, which I feel in the depths of my heart.\\nAnd that woman nursing him, who pretends not to know him! Ah! how true\\nit is that cunning is inborn in those creatures!\"\\n\\nSir Ralph, utterly nonplussed, walked methodically up and down the room\\nthree times. At his first turn he drew the conclusion: _improbable_; at\\nthe second: _impossible_; at the third: _proven._ Then, returning with\\nhis impassive face to the colonel, he pointed to Noun, who was standing\\nbehind the wounded man, wringing her hands, with haggard eyes and livid\\ncheeks, in the immobility of despair, terror and misery.\\n\\nA real discovery carries with it such a power of swift and overwhelming\\nconviction, that the colonel was more impressed by Sir Ralph\\'s emphatic\\ngesture than he would have been by the most persuasive eloquence.\\nDoubtless Sir Ralph had more than one means of striking the right scent;\\nhe recalled the fact that Noun was in the park when he called her, her\\nwet hair, her damp, muddy shoes, which testified to a strange fancy for\\nwalking abroad in the rain--trivial details which had made but slight\\nimpression on him at the time that Madame Delmare fainted, but which\\nrecurred to his memory now. Then, too, the extraordinary terror she had\\nmanifested, her convulsive agitation, and the cry she had uttered when\\nshe heard the shot.\\n\\nMonsieur Delmare did not require all this evidence; being more\\npenetrating because he had more interest in the matter, he had only to\\nlook at the girl\\'s face to see that she alone was guilty. But his wife\\'s\\nassiduity in ministering to the hero of this amorous adventure became\\nmore and more distasteful to him.\\n\\n\"Leave us, Indiana,\" he said. \"It is late and you are not well. Noun\\nwill remain with monsieur to take care of him during the night, and\\nto-morrow, if he is better, we will see about having him taken home.\"\\n\\nThere was nothing to say in reply to this unexpected complaisance.\\nMadame Delmare, who was so determined in her resistance to her husband\\'s\\nviolence, always yielded to his milder moods. She requested Sir Ralph to\\nremain a little longer with the patient, and withdrew to her bedroom.\\n\\nNot without ulterior motives had the colonel arranged things thus. An\\nhour later, when everybody had gone to bed and the house was still, he\\nstole softly into the room where Monsieur de Ramière lay, and, hiding\\nbehind a curtain, was speedily convinced, by the young man\\'s\\nconversation with the lady\\'s-maid, that an amorous intrigue between the\\ntwo was in progress. The young creole\\'s unusual beauty had created a\\nsensation at the rustic balls in the neighborhood. She had not lacked\\noffers of homage, even from members of some of the first families of the\\nprovince. More than one handsome officer of lancers, in garrison at\\nMelun, had put himself out to please her; but Noun was still to have her\\nfirst love affair, and only one of her suitors had succeeded in pleasing\\nher: Monsieur de Ramière.\\n\\nColonel Delmare was by no means desirous of following the development of\\ntheir liaison; so he retired as soon as he had made sure that his wife\\nhad not for an instant occupied the thoughts of the Almaviva of this\\nadventure. He heard enough of it, however, to realize the difference\\nbetween the love of poor Noun, who threw herself into the affair with\\nall the vehemence of her passionate nature, and that of the well-born\\nyouth, who yielded to the impulse of a day without abjuring the right to\\nresume his reason on the morrow.\\n\\nWhen Madame Delmare awoke she found Noun beside her bed, embarrassed and\\ndowncast. But she had ingenuously given credence to Monsieur de\\nRamière\\'s explanation, the more readily as persons interested in\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s line of trade had previously tried to surprise the\\nsecrets of the Delmare factory, by stratagem or by fraud. She attributed\\nher companion\\'s embarrassment therefore to the excitement and fatigue of\\nthe night, and Noun took courage when she saw the colonel calmly enter\\nhis wife\\'s room and discuss the affair of the previous evening with her\\nas a perfectly natural occurrence.\\n\\nIn the morning Sir Ralph had satisfied himself as to the patient\\'s\\ncondition. The fall, although a severe one, had had no serious result;\\nthe wound in the hand had already closed; Monsieur de Ramière had\\nexpressed a desire to be taken to Melun, and he had distributed the\\ncontents of his purse among the servants to induce them to keep quiet\\nconcerning his adventure, in order, he said, that his mother, who lived\\nwithin a few leagues, might not be alarmed. Thus the story became known\\nvery slowly, and in several different versions. Certain information\\nconcerning the English factory of Monsieur de Ramière, the brother,\\nadded weight to the fiction the intruder had happily improvised. The\\ncolonel and Sir Ralph had the delicacy to keep Noun\\'s secret, without\\neven letting her know that they knew it; and the Delmare family soon\\nceased to give any thought to the incident.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nYou will find it difficult to believe perhaps that Monsieur de Ramière,\\na young man of brilliant intellect, considerable talents and many\\nestimable qualities, accustomed to salon triumphs and to adventures in\\nperfumed boudoirs, had conceived a very durable passion for the\\nhousekeeper in the household of a small manufacturer in Brie. And yet\\nMonsieur de Ramière was neither fop nor libertine. We have said that he\\nwas intelligent--that is to say, he appreciated the advantages of birth\\nat their real value. He was a man of high principle when he argued with\\nhimself; but vehement passions often carried him beyond the bounds of\\nhis theories. At such times he was incapable of reflection, or he\\navoided appearing before the tribunal of his conscience: he went astray,\\nas if without his own knowledge, and the man of yesterday strove to\\ndeceive him of to-morrow. Unfortunately the most salient feature in his\\ncharacter was not his principles, which he possessed in common with many\\nother white-gloved philosophers and which no more preserved him from\\ninconsistency than they preserve them; but his passions, which no\\nprinciples could stifle, and which made of him a man apart in that\\ndegenerate society where it is so difficult to depart from the beaten\\npath without appearing ridiculous. Raymon had the art of being often\\nculpable without arousing hatred, often eccentric without being\\noffensive; indeed he sometimes succeeded in arousing the pity of people\\nwho had the most reason to complain of him. There are men who are\\nhumored thus by every one who approaches them. Sometimes an attractive\\nface and animated speech make up the sum total of their sensibility. We\\ndo not presume to judge Monsieur Raymon de Ramière so harshly, nor to\\ndraw his portrait before exhibiting him in action. We are examining him\\nnow at a distance, like the multitude who pass him in the street.\\n\\nMonsieur de Ramière was in love with the young creole with the great\\nblack eyes, who had aroused the admiration of the whole province at the\\nfête of Rubelles; but he was in love and nothing more. He had made her\\nacquaintance because he had nothing else to do, perhaps, and success had\\nkindled his desires; he had obtained more than he asked, and on the day\\nthat he triumphed over that easily vanquished heart he returned home\\ndismayed by his victory, and said to himself, striking his forehead:\\n\\n\"God grant that she doesn\\'t love me!\"\\n\\nThus it was not until after he had accepted all the proofs of her love\\nthat he began to suspect the existence of that love. Then he repented,\\nbut it was too late; he must either resign himself to what the future\\nmight have in store, or retreat like a coward toward the past. Raymon\\ndid not hesitate; he allowed himself to be loved, he loved in return for\\ngratitude; he scaled the walls of the Delmare estate from love of\\ndanger; he had a terrible fall from awkwardness; and he was so touched\\nby his lovely young mistress\\'s grief that he deemed himself justified\\nthenceforth in his own eyes in continuing to dig the pit into which she\\nwas destined to fall.\\n\\nWhen he had recovered, winter had no storms, darkness no perils, remorse\\nno stings which could deter him from passing through the corner of the\\nforest to meet the young creole and swear to her that he had never loved\\nany other woman; that he preferred her to the queens of society, and a\\nthousand other exaggerations which will always be fashionable with poor\\nand credulous maidens. In January Madame Delmare went to Paris with her\\nhusband; Sir Ralph Brown, their excellent neighbor, betook himself to\\nhis own estate, and Noun, being left in charge of her master\\'s country\\nhouse, was able to absent herself on various pretexts. It was\\nunfortunate for her, and this facility of intercourse with her lover\\ngreatly abridged the ephemeral happiness which she was destined to\\nenjoy. The forest with its poetic shadows, its arabesques of hoar-frost,\\nits moonlight effects, the mysterious going and coming by the little\\ngate, the furtive departure in the morning when Noun\\'s little feet, as\\nshe accompanied him to the gate, left their prints on the snow in the\\npark--all these accessories of an amorous intrigue served to prolong\\nMonsieur de Ramière\\'s intoxication. Noun, in white _déshablilé_, with\\nher long black hair for ornament, was a lady, a queen, a fairy; when he\\nsaw her come forth from that red brick castle, a heavy, square structure\\nof the time of the Regency, with a semi-feudal aspect, he could easily\\nfancy her a châtelaine of the Middle Ages, and in the summerhouse\\nfilled with rare flowers, where she made him drunk with the seductions\\nof youth and passion, he readily forgot all that he was destined to\\nremember later.\\n\\nBut when Noun, disdaining precautions and defying danger in her turn,\\ncame to him at his home, with her white apron and neckerchief\\ncoquettishly arranged according to the fashion of her country, she was\\nnothing more than a maid and a maid in the service of a pretty woman--a\\ncircumstance that always makes a soubrette seem like a makeshift. And\\nyet Noun was very lovely, it was in that dress that he had first seen\\nher at that village fête where he had forced his way through the crowd\\nof curious bystanders, and had enjoyed the petty triumph of carrying her\\noff from a score of rivals. Noun would lovingly remind him of that day;\\nshe did not know, poor child, that Raymon\\'s love did not date back so\\nfar, and that her day of pride had been only a day of vanity to him. And\\nthen the courage with which she sacrificed her reputation to him--that\\ncourage which should have made him love her all the more--displeased\\nMonsieur de Ramière. The wife of a peer of France who should sacrifice\\nherself so recklessly would be a priceless conquest; but a lady\\'s maid!\\nThat which is heroism in the one becomes brazen-faced effrontery in the\\nother. With the one a world of jealous rivals envies you; with the other\\na rabble of scandalized flunkeys condemns you. The lady of quality\\nsacrifices twenty previous lovers to you; the lady\\'s maid sacrifices\\nonly a husband that she might have had.\\n\\nWhat can you expect? Raymon was a man of fashionable morals, of elegant\\nmanners, of poetic passion. In his eyes a grisette was not a woman, and\\nNoun, by virtue of a beauty of the first order, had taken him by\\nsurprise on a day of popular merrymaking. All this was not Raymon\\'s\\nfault; he had been reared to shine in society, all his thoughts had been\\ndirected toward an exalted goal, all his faculties had been moulded to\\nenjoy princely good fortune, and the ardor of his blood had led him into\\nbourgeois amours against his will. He had done all that he possibly\\ncould do to prolong his enjoyment, but he had failed; what was he to do\\nnow? Ideas extravagant in generosity had passed through his brain; on\\nthe days when he was most in love with his mistress he had thought\\nseriously of raising her to his level, of legitimizing their union. Yes,\\nupon my honor, he had thought of it; but love, which legitimizes\\neverything, was growing weaker now; it was passing away with the perils\\nof the intrigue and the piquant charm of mystery. Marriage was no longer\\npossible; and note this: Raymon reasoned very cogently and altogether in\\nhis mistress\\'s favor.\\n\\nIf he had really loved her, he could, by sacrificing to her his future,\\nhis family and his reputation, still have found happiness, and,\\nconsequently, have made her happy; for love is a contract no less than\\nmarriage. But, his ardor having cooled as he felt that it had, what\\nfuture could he create for her? Should he marry her and display day\\nafter day a gloomy face, a cold heart, a comfortless home? Should he\\nmarry her and make her odious to her family, contemptible in the eyes of\\nher equals, and a laughing-stock to her servants; take the risk of\\nintroducing her in a social circle where she would feel that she was out\\nof place; where humiliation would kill her; and, lastly, overwhelm her\\nwith remorse by forcing her to realize all the trials she had brought\\nupon her lover?\\n\\nNo, you will agree with him that it was impossible, that it would not\\nhave been generous, that a man cannot contend thus with society, and\\nthat such heroic virtue resembles Don Quixote breaking his lance against\\na windmill; an iron courage which a breath of wind scatters; the\\nchivalry of another age which arouses the pitying contempt of this age.\\n\\nHaving thus weighed all the arguments, Monsieur de Ramière concluded\\nthat it would be better to break that unfortunate bond. Noun\\'s visits\\nwere beginning to be painful to him. His mother, who had gone to Paris\\nfor the winter, would not fail to hear of the little scandal before\\nlong. Even now she was surprised at his frequent visits to Cercy, their\\ncountry estate, and at his passing whole weeks there. He had, to be\\nsure, alleged as a pretext, an important piece of work which he was\\nfinishing away from the noise of the city; but that pretext was\\nbeginning to be worn out. It grieved Raymon to deceive so kind a mother,\\nto deprive her for so long a time of his filial attentions; and--how\\nshall I tell you?--he left Cercy and did not return.\\n\\nNoun wept and waited, and as the days and weeks passed, unhappy creature\\nthat she was, she ventured so far as to write. Poor girl! that was the\\nlast stroke. A letter from a lady\\'s maid! Yet she had taken\\nsatin-finished paper and perfumed wax from Madame Delmare\\'s desk, and\\nher style from her heart. But the spelling! Do you know how much energy\\na syllable more or less adds to or detracts from the sentiments? Alas!\\nthe poor half-civilized girl from Ile Bourbon did not know even that\\nthere were rules for the use of language. She believed that she wrote\\nand spoke as correctly as her mistress, and when she found that Raymon\\ndid not return she said to herself:\\n\\n\"And yet my letter was well adapted to bring him.\"\\n\\nThat letter Raymon lacked courage to read to the end. It was a\\nmasterpiece of ingenuous and graceful passion; it is doubtful if\\nVirginia wrote Paul a more charming one after she left her native land.\\nBut Monsieur de Ramière made haste to throw it in the fire, fearful\\nlest he should blush for himself. Once more, what do you expect? This is\\na prejudice of education, and self-love is a part of love just as\\nself-interest is a part of friendship.\\n\\nMonsieur de Ramière\\'s absence had been noticed in society; that is much\\nto say of a man, in respect to this society of ours where all men\\nresemble one another. One may be a man of intelligence and still care\\nfor society, just as one may be a fool and despise it. Raymon liked it,\\nand he was justified in his liking, for he was a favorite and was much\\nsought after; and that multitude of indifferent or sneering masks\\nassumed for him attentive and interested smiles. Unfortunate men may be\\nmisanthropes, but those persons of whom one is fond are rarely\\nungrateful; at least so Raymon thought. He was grateful for the\\nslightest manifestations of attachment, desirous of universal esteem,\\nproud of having a large number of friends.\\n\\nIn this society, whose prejudices are absolute, everything had succeeded\\nin his case, even his faults; and when he sought the cause of this\\nuniversal affection which had always encompassed him, he found it in\\nhimself, in his longing to obtain it, in the joy it caused him, in the\\nhearty kindliness which he dealt out lavishly without exhausting it.\\n\\nHe owed it in some measure to his mother too, whose superior\\nintelligence, sparkling conversation and private virtues made her an\\nexceptional woman. It was from her that he inherited those excellent\\nprinciples which always led him back to the right path and prevented\\nhim, despite the impetuosity of his twenty-five years, from ever\\nforfeiting his claim to public esteem. Moreover, people were more\\nindulgent to him than to others because his mother had the knack of\\napologizing for him while blaming him, of commanding indulgence when she\\nseemed to implore it. She was one of those women who had lived through\\ndifferent epochs so utterly dissimilar that their minds become as\\nflexible as their destinies; who have grown rich on experience of\\nmisfortune; who have escaped the scaffolds of \\'93, the vices of the\\nDirectory, the vanities of the Empire and the enmities of the\\nRestoration; rare women, whose kind is dying out.\\n\\nIt was at a ball at the Spanish ambassador\\'s that Raymon reappeared in\\nsociety.\\n\\n\"Monsieur de Ramière, if I am not mistaken,\" said a pretty woman to her\\nneighbor.\\n\\n\"He is a comet who appears at irregular intervals,\" was the reply. \"It\\nis centuries since any one heard of the pretty fellow.\"\\n\\nThe lady who spoke thus was a middle-aged foreigner. Her companion\\nblushed slightly.\\n\\n\"He\\'s very good-looking, is he not, madame?\" she said.\\n\\n\"Charming, on my word,\" replied the old Sicilian.\\n\\n\"You are talking about the hero of the eclectic salons, the dark-eyed\\nRaymon, I\\'ll be bound,\" said a dashing colonel of the guard.\\n\\n\"He has a fine head to study,\" rejoined the younger woman.\\n\\n\"And what pleases you even more, I dare say,\" said the colonel, \"a\\nwicked head.\"\\n\\nThe young woman was his wife.\\n\\n\"Why a wicked head?\" queried the Sicilian.\\n\\n\"Full of genuine Southern passions, madame, worthy of the bright\\nsunlight of Palermo.\"\\n\\nTwo or three young women put forward their flower-laden heads to hear\\nwhat the colonel was saying.\\n\\n\"He made ravages in the garrison last year, I promise you,\" he\\ncontinued. \"We fellows shall be obliged to pick a quarrel with him, in\\norder to get rid of him.\"\\n\\n\"If he\\'s a Lovelace, so much the worse for him,\" said a young lady with\\na satirical cast of countenance; \"I can\\'t endure men whom everybody\\nloves.\"\\n\\nThe ultramontane countess waited until the colonel had walked away, when\\nshe tapped Mademoiselle de Nangy\\'s fingers lightly with her fan and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t speak so; you don\\'t know here what to think of a man who wants to\\nbe liked.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think, pray, that all they have to do is to want it?\" said the\\ndamsel with the long sardonic eyes.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the colonel, coming up again to invite her to\\ndance; \"take care that the charming Raymon does not overhear you.\"\\n\\nMademoiselle de Nangy laughed; but during the rest of the evening the\\npretty group of which she was one dared not mention Monsieur de\\nRamière\\'s name again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nMonsieur de Ramière wandered amid the undulating waves of that\\ngayly-dressed crowd without distaste and without ennui.\\n\\nNevertheless, he was fighting against a feeling of chagrin. On returning\\nto his own sphere he had a species of remorse, of shame for all the wild\\nideas which a misplaced attachment had suggested to him. He looked at\\nthe women so brilliantly beautiful in the bright light; he listened to\\ntheir refined and clever conversation; he heard their talents highly\\npraised; and in those marvellous specimens of their sex, those almost\\nroyal costumes, those exquisitely appropriate remarks, he found on all\\nsides an implied reproach for having been untrue to his destiny. But,\\ndespite this species of mental bewilderment, Raymon suffered from more\\ngenuine remorse; for his intentions were always kind and considerate to\\nthe last degree, and a woman\\'s tears broke his heart, hardened as it\\nwas.\\n\\nThe honors of the evening were universally accorded to a young woman\\nwhose name no one knew, and who enjoyed the privilege of monopolizing\\nattention because her appearance in society was a novelty. The\\nsimplicity of her costume alone would have sufficed to make her a\\ndistinguished figure amid the diamonds, feathers and flowers in which\\nthe other women were arrayed. Strings of pearls woven into her black\\nhair were her only jewels. The lustreless white of her necklace, her\\ncrêpe dress and her bare shoulders blended at a little distance, and\\nthe heated atmosphere of the apartments had barely succeeded in bringing\\nto her cheeks a faint flush of as delicate a shade as that of a Bengal\\nrose blooming on the snow. She was a tiny, dainty, slender creature; a\\nsalon type of beauty to which the bright light of the candles gave a\\nfairylike touch, and which a sunbeam would have dimmed. When she danced\\nshe was so light that a breath would have whisked her away; but in her\\nlightness there was no animation, no pleasure. When she was seated she\\nbent forward as if her too flexible body lacked strength to support\\nitself, and when she spoke she smiled sadly. Fantastic tales were at the\\nvery height of their vogue at this period. Accordingly, those who were\\nlearned in that line compared this young woman to a fascinating\\napparition evoked by sorcery, which would fade away and vanish like a\\ndream when the first flush of dawn appeared on the horizon.\\n\\nMeanwhile they crowded about her to invite her to dance.\\n\\n\"Make haste,\" said a dandy of a romantic turn to one of his friends;\\n\"the cock will crow soon, and even now your partner\\'s feet have ceased\\nto touch the floor. I\\'ll wager that you can\\'t feel her hand in yours.\"\\n\\n\"Pray look at Monsieur de Ramière\\'s dark, strongly-marked face,\" said\\nan _artistic_ lady to her neighbor. \"Contrast him with that pale,\\nslender young woman, and see if the _solid_ tone of the one doesn\\'t make\\nan admirable foil for the _delicate_ tone of the other.\"\\n\\n\"That young woman,\" said a woman who knew everybody and who played the\\npart of an almanac at social functions, \"is the daughter of that old\\nfool, De Carvajal, who tried to play Joséphin, and who died ruined at\\nIle Bourbon. This lovely exotic flower has made a foolish marriage, I\\nbelieve; but her aunt stands well at court.\"\\n\\nRaymon had drawn near the fair Indian. A peculiar emotion seized him\\nevery time that he looked at her; he had seen that pale, sad face;\\nperhaps in some dream, but at all events he had seen it, and his eyes\\nrested upon it with the delight we all feel on seeing once more a\\ncharming vision which we thought that we had lost forever.\\n\\nRaymon\\'s gaze disturbed her who was the object of it; she was awkward\\nand shy, like a person unaccustomed to society, and the sensation that\\nshe caused seemed to embarrass rather than to please her. Raymon made\\nthe circuit of the salon, succeeded finally in learning that her name\\nwas Madame Delmare, and went and asked her to dance.\\n\\n\"You do not remember me,\" he said, when they were alone in the midst of\\nthe crowd; \"but I have not been able to forget you, madame. And yet I\\nsaw you for an instant only, through a cloud; but in that instant you\\nseemed so kind, so compassionate.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare started.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, monsieur,\" she said quickly, \"it is you! I recognized you,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nThen she blushed and seemed to fear that she had offended the\\nproprieties. She looked around as if to see whether anyone had heard\\nher. Her timidity enhanced her natural charm, and Raymon was touched to\\nthe heart by the tone of that creole voice, slightly husky, but so sweet\\nthat it seemed made to pray or to bless.\\n\\n\"I was afraid,\" he said, \"that I should never have an opportunity to\\nthank you. I could not call upon you and I knew that you went but little\\ninto society. I feared, also, that if I made your acquaintance I should\\ncome in contact with Monsieur Delmare, and our previous relations could\\nnot fail to make that contact disagreeable. How glad I am for this\\nmoment, which enables me to pay the debt of my heart!\"\\n\\n\"It would be much pleasanter for me,\" said she, \"if Monsieur Delmare\\nalso could enjoy it; and if you knew him better you would know that he\\nis as kind as he is brusque. You would forgive him for having been your\\ninvoluntary assailant, for his heart certainly bled more freely than\\nyour wound.\"\\n\\n\"Let us not talk of Monsieur Delmare, madame; I forgive him with all my\\nheart. I injured him and he took the law into his own hands. I have\\nnothing more to do but to forget; but as to you, madame, who lavished\\nsuch delicate and generous attentions upon me, I choose to remember all\\nmy life your treatment of me, your pure features, your angelic\\ngentleness, and these hands which poured balm upon my wounds and which I\\ndared not kiss.\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke Raymon held Madame Delmare\\'s hand, to be prepared to walk\\nthrough their figure in the contradance. He pressed that hand gently in\\nhis, and all the young woman\\'s blood rushed to her heart.\\n\\nWhen he led Madame Delmare back to her seat, her aunt, Madame de\\nCarvajal, had gone; the crowd was thinning. Raymon sat down beside her.\\nHe had that ease of manner which a wide experience in affairs of the\\nheart imparts; it is the violence of our desires, the precipitate haste\\nof our love, that makes us stupid when we are with women. The man who\\nhas rubbed the edge off his emotions a little is more anxious to please\\nthan to love. Nevertheless Monsieur de Ramière felt more deeply moved\\nin the presence of that simple, unspoiled woman than he had ever been.\\nPerhaps this swift impression was due to his memory of the night he had\\npassed at her house; but it is certain that, while he talked to her with\\nanimation, his heart did not lead his mouth astray. However, the habit\\nhe had acquired with other women gave to his words a power of persuasion\\nto which the untutored Indiana yielded, not understanding that it had\\nnot all been invented expressly for her.\\n\\nIn general--and women are well aware of it--a man who talks wittily of\\nlove is only moderately in love. Raymon was an exception; he expressed\\npassion artistically and felt it ardently. But it was not passion that\\nrendered him eloquent, it was eloquence that made him passionate. He\\nknew that he had a weakness for women, and he would become eloquent in\\norder to seduce a woman and fall in love with her while seducing her. It\\nwas sentiment of the sort dealt in by advocates and preachers, who weep\\nhot tears when they perspire freely. He sometimes fell in with women who\\nwere shrewd enough to distrust these heated improvisations; but he had\\ncommitted what are called follies for love\\'s sake: he had run away with\\na girl of noble birth; he had compromised women of very high station; he\\nhad had three sensational duels; he had displayed to a crowded evening\\nparty, to a whole theatre full of spectators, the bewilderment of his\\nheart and the disarray of his thoughts. A man who does all this without\\nfear of ridicule or of curses, and who succeeds in avoiding both, is\\nsafe from all assault; he can take any risk and hope for anything. Thus\\nthe most skilfully constructed defences yielded to the consideration\\nthat Raymon was madly in love when he meddled with love at all. A man\\ncapable of making a fool of himself for love is a rare prodigy in\\nsociety, and one that women do not disdain.\\n\\nI do not know how it happened, but when he escorted Madame de Carvajal\\nand Madame Delmare to their carriage he succeeded in putting Indiana\\'s\\nlittle hand to his lips. Never before had a man\\'s furtive, burning kiss\\nbreathed upon that woman\\'s fingers, although she was born in a fiery\\nclimate and was nineteen years old; nineteen years of Ile Bourbon, which\\nare equivalent to twenty-five in our country.\\n\\nIll and nervous as she was, that kiss almost extorted a shriek from her,\\nand she had to be assisted into the carriage. Raymon had never come in\\ncontact with such a delicate organization. Noun, the creole, was in\\nrobust health, and Parisian women do not faint when their hands are\\nkissed.\\n\\n\"If I should see her twice,\" he said to himself as he walked away, \"I\\nshould lose my head over her.\"\\n\\nThe next morning he had completely forgotten Noun.\\n\\nAll that he knew about her was that she belonged to Madame Delmare. The\\npale-faced Indiana engrossed all his thoughts, filled all his dreams.\\nWhen Raymon began to feel the shafts of love he was in the habit of\\nseeking to distract his thoughts, not in order to stifle the budding\\npassion, but, on the contrary, to drive away the reasoning power that\\nurged him to weigh its consequences. Of an ardent temperament, he\\npursued his object hotly. He had not the power to quell the tempests\\nwhich arose in his bosom, nor to rekindle them when he felt that they\\nwere dying away and vanishing.\\n\\nHe succeeded the next day in learning that Monsieur Delmare had gone to\\nBrussels on a business trip, and had left his wife in charge of Madame\\nde Carvajal, of whom he was not at all fond, but who was Madame\\nDelmare\\'s only relative. He, an upstart soldier, belonged to a poor and\\nobscure family, of which he seemed to be ashamed, simply because he\\nrepeated so often that he was not ashamed of it. But, although he passed\\nhis life reproaching his wife for alleged scorn of him which she did not\\nentertain, he was conscious that he ought not to compel her to live on\\nterms of intimacy with his uneducated kindred. Moreover, despite his\\ndislike for Madame de Carvajal, he could not refuse to treat her with\\ngreat deference for these reasons.\\n\\nMadame de Carvajal, who was descended from a noble Spanish family, was\\none of those women who cannot make up their minds to be of no account in\\nthe world. In the days when Napoleon ruled Europe she had burned incense\\nto the glory of Napoleon, and with her husband and brother-in-law had\\njoined the party of the Joséphinos; but her husband had lost his life\\nat the fall of the conqueror\\'s short-lived dynasty, and Indiana\\'s father\\nhad taken refuge in the French colonies. Thereupon Madame de Carvajal,\\nbeing a clever and active person, had repaired to Paris, and there, by\\nsome fortunate speculations on the Bourse, had built up for herself a\\nnew competence on the ruins of her past splendors. By dint of shrewd\\nwit, intrigues and piety she had also obtained some favor at Court, and\\nher establishment, while it was by no means brilliant, was one of the\\nmost respectable of all those presided over by protégés of the Civil\\nList.\\n\\nWhen Indiana arrived in France after her father\\'s death, as the bride of\\nColonel Delmare, Madame de Carvajal was but moderately pleased by so\\npaltry an alliance. Nevertheless she saw that Monsieur Delmare, whose\\ngood sense and activity in business were worth a dowry, prospered with\\nhis slender capital; and she purchased for Indiana the little château\\nof Lagny and the factory connected with it. In two years, thanks to\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s technical knowledge and certain funds advanced by Sir\\nRodolphe Brown, his wife\\'s cousin by marriage, the colonel\\'s affairs\\ntook a fortunate turn; he began to pay off his debts, and Madame de\\nCarvajal, in whose eyes fortune was the first recommendation, manifested\\nmuch affection for her niece and promised her the remnant of her wealth.\\nIndiana, who was devoid of ambition, was devotedly kind and attentive to\\nher aunt from gratitude, not from self-interest; but there was at least\\nas much of one as of the other in the colonel\\'s manœuvres. He was a man\\nof iron in the matter of his political opinions; he would listen to no\\nargument concerning the unassailable glory of his great emperor, and he\\nupheld that glory with the blind obstinacy of a child of sixty years. He\\nwas obliged therefore to put forth all his patience to refrain from\\nbreaking out again and again in Madame de Carjaval\\'s salon, where the\\nRestoration was lauded to the skies. What Delmare suffered at the hands\\nof five or six pious old women is beyond description. His vexation on\\nthis account was in part the cause of his frequent ill-humor against his\\nwife.\\n\\nSo much for Madame de Carvajal; we return now to Monsieur de Ramière.\\nAt the end of three days he had learned all these domestic details, so\\nactively had he followed up everything likely to put him in the way of\\nan intimate acquaintance with the Delmare family. He learned that by\\nacquiring Madame de Carvajal\\'s favor he could obtain opportunities of\\nmeeting Indiana. On the evening of the third day he procured an\\nintroduction to the aunt.\\n\\nIn her salon there were four or five barbarians solemnly playing\\n_reversi_, and two or three young men of family, as utterly vapid as it\\nis allowable for a man to be who has sixteen quarterings of nobility.\\nIndiana was at work patiently filling in the background of a piece of\\nembroidery on her aunt\\'s frame. She was leaning over her work,\\napparently absorbed by that mechanical operation, and, it may be, well\\npleased to escape in this way the dull chatter of her neighbors. For\\naught I know, behind the long black hair that fell over the flowers of\\nher embroidery, she was reviewing in her mind the emotions of that\\nfleeting instant which had opened the door of a new life to her, when\\nthe servant\\'s voice, announcing several new arrivals, made it necessary\\nfor her to rise. She did so mechanically, for she had paid no heed to\\nthe names, and barely lifted her eyes from her embroidery; but a voice\\nat her side made her start as if she had received an electric shock, and\\nshe was obliged to lean on her work-table to avoid falling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nRaymon was not prepared for that silent salon, peopled only by a few\\ntaciturn guests. It was impossible to utter a word which was not heard\\nin every corner of the room. The dowagers who were playing cards seemed\\nto be there for the sole purpose of embarrassing the conversation of the\\nyounger guests, and Raymon fancied that he could read on their stern\\nfeatures the secret satisfaction which old age takes in avenging itself\\nby blocking other people\\'s pleasure. He had counted upon a less\\nconstrained, tenderer interview than that of the ball, and it was just\\nthe opposite. This unexpected difficulty gave greater intensity to his\\ndesires, more fire to his glances, more animation and vivacity to the\\nroundabout remarks he addressed to Madame Delmare. The poor child was\\naltogether unused to this style of attack. She could not possibly defend\\nherself, because nothing was asked of her; but she was forced to listen\\nto the proffer of an ardent heart, to learn how dearly she was loved,\\nand to allow herself to be encompassed by all the perils of seduction\\nwithout making any resistance. Her embarrassment increased with Raymon\\'s\\nboldness. Madame de Carvajal, who made some reasonably well-founded\\nclaims to wit, and to whom Monsieur de Ramière\\'s wit had been highly\\npraised, left the card-table to challenge him to a refined discussion\\nconcerning love, into which she introduced much Spanish heat and German\\nmetaphysics. Raymon eagerly accepted the challenge, and, on the pretext\\nof answering the aunt, said to the niece all that she would have refused\\nto hear. The poor young wife, without a protector and exposed to so\\nlively and skilful an assault on all sides, could not muster strength to\\ntake part in that thorny discussion. In vain did her aunt, who was\\nanxious to exhibit her to advantage, call upon her to testify to the\\ntruth of certain subtle theories of sentiment; she confessed blushingly\\nthat she knew nothing about such things, and Raymon, intoxicated with\\njoy to see her cheeks flush and her bosom heave, swore inwardly that he\\nwould teach her.\\n\\nIndiana slept less that night than she had done for the last two or\\nthree nights; as we have said, she had never been in love, and her heart\\nhad long been ripe for a sentiment which none of the men she had met\\nhitherto had succeeded in arousing. She had been brought up by a father\\nof an eccentric and violent character, and had never known the happiness\\nwhich is derived from the affection of another person. Monsieur de\\nCarvajal, drunk with political passions, consumed by ambitious regrets,\\nhad become the most cruel planter and the most disagreeable neighbor in\\nthe colonies; his daughter had suffered keenly from his detestable\\nhumor. But, by dint of watching the constant tableau of the evils of\\nslavery, of enduring the weariness of solitude and dependence, she had\\nacquired a superficial patience, proof against every trial, an adorable\\nkindliness toward her inferiors, but also an iron will and an\\nincalculable power of resistance to everything that tended to oppress\\nher. By marrying Delmare she simply changed masters; by coming to live\\nat Lagny, she changed her prison and the locus of her solitude. She did\\nnot love her husband, perhaps for the very reason that she was told that\\nit was her duty to love him, and that it had become with her a sort of\\nsecond nature, a principle of conduct, a law of conscience, to resist\\nmentally every sort of moral constraint. No one had attempted to point\\nout to her any other law than that of blind obedience.\\n\\nBrought up in the desert, neglected by her father, surrounded by slaves,\\nto whom she could offer no other assistance or encouragement than her\\ncompassion and her tears, she had accustomed herself to say: \"A day will\\ncome when everything in my life will be changed, when I shall do good to\\nothers, when some one will love me, when I shall give my whole heart to\\nthe man who gives me his; meanwhile, I will suffer in silence and keep\\nmy love as a reward for him who shall set me free.\" This liberator, this\\nMessiah had not come; Indiana was still awaiting him. She no longer\\ndared, it is true, to confess to herself her whole thought. She had\\nrealized under the clipped hedge-rows of Lagny that thought itself was\\nmore fettered there than under the wild palms of Ile Bourbon; and when\\nshe caught herself saying, as she used to say: \"A day will come--a man\\nwill come\"--she forced that rash longing back to the depths of her\\nheart, and said to herself: \"Death alone will bring that day!\"\\n\\nAnd so she was dying. A strange malady was consuming her youth. She was\\nwithout strength and unable to sleep. The doctors looked in vain for any\\ndiscoverable disorder, for none existed; all her faculties were failing\\naway in equal degree, all her organs were gradually degenerating; her\\nheart was burning at a slow fire, her eyes were losing their lustre, the\\ncirculation of her blood was governed entirely by excitement and fever;\\na few months more and the poor captive bird would surely die. But,\\nwhatever the extent of her resignation and her discouragement, the need\\nremained the same. That silent, broken heart was still calling\\ninvoluntarily to some generous youthful heart to revivify it. The being\\nwhom she had loved most dearly hitherto was Noun, the cheery and brave\\ncompanion of her tedious solitude; and the man who had manifested the\\ngreatest liking for her was her phlegmatic cousin Sir Ralph. What food\\nfor the all-consuming activity of her thoughts--a poor girl, ignorant\\nand neglected like herself, and an Englishman whose only passion was\\nfox-hunting!\\n\\nMadame Delmare was genuinely unhappy, and the first time that she felt\\nthe burning breath of a young and passionate man enter her frigid\\natmosphere, the first time that a tender and caressing word delighted\\nher ear, and quivering lips left a mark as of a red-hot iron on her\\nhand, she thought neither of the duties that had been laid upon her, nor\\nof the prudence that had been enjoined upon her, nor of the future that\\nhad been predicted for her; she remembered only the hateful past, her\\nlong suffering, her despotic masters. Nor did it occur to her that the\\nman before her might be false or fickle. She saw him as she wished him\\nto be, as she had dreamed of him, and Raymon could easily have deceived\\nher if he had not been sincere.\\n\\nBut how could he fail to be sincere with so lovely and loving a woman?\\nWhat other had ever laid bare her heart to him with such candor and\\ningenuousness? With what other had he been able to look forward to a\\nfuture so captivating and so secure? Was she not born to love him, this\\nslave who simply awaited a sign to break her chains, a word to follow\\nhim? Evidently heaven had made for Raymon this melancholy child of Ile\\nBourbon, whom no one had ever loved, and who but for him must have died.\\n\\nNevertheless a feeling of terror succeeded this all-pervading, feverish\\njoy in Madame Delmare\\'s heart. She thought of her quick-tempered,\\nkeen-eyed, vindictive husband, and she was afraid,--not for herself, for\\nshe was inured to threats, but for the man who was about to undertake a\\nbattle to the death with her tyrant. She knew so little of society that\\nshe transformed her life into a tragic romance; a timid creature, who\\ndared not love for fear of endangering her lover\\'s life, she gave no\\nthought to the danger of destroying herself.\\n\\nThis then was the secret of her resistance, the motive of her virtue.\\nShe made up her mind on the following day to avoid Monsieur de Ramière.\\nThat very evening there was a ball at the house of one of the leading\\nbankers of Paris. Madame de Carvajal, who, being an old woman with no\\nties of affection, was very fond of society, proposed to attend with\\nIndiana; but Raymon was to be there and Indiana determined not to go. To\\navoid her aunt\\'s persecution, Madame Delmare, who was never able to\\nresist except in action, pretended to assent to the plan; she allowed\\nherself to be dressed and waited until Madame de Carvajal was ready;\\nthen she changed her ball dress for a robe de chambre, seated herself in\\nfront of the fire and resolutely awaited the conflict. When the old\\nSpaniard, as rigid and gorgeous as a portrait by Van Dyck, came to call\\nher, Indiana declared that she was not well and did not feel that she\\ncould go out. In vain did her aunt urge her to make an effort.\\n\\n\"I would be only too glad to go,\" she said, \"but you see that I can\\nhardly stand. I should be only a trouble to you to-night. Go to the ball\\nwithout me, dear aunt; I shall enjoy the thought of your pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Go without you!\" said Madame de Carvajal, who was sorely distressed at\\nthe idea of having made an elaborate toilet to no purpose, and who\\nshrank from the horrors of a solitary evening. \"Why, what business have\\nI in society, an old woman whom no one speaks to except to be near you?\\nWhat will become of me without my niece\\'s lovely eyes to give me value?\"\\n\\n\"Your wit will fill the gap, my dear aunt,\" said Indiana.\\n\\nThe Marquise de Carvajal, who only wanted to be urged, set off at last.\\nWhereupon, Indiana hid her face in her hands and began to weep; for she\\nhad made a great sacrifice and believed that she had already blasted the\\nattractive prospect of the day before.\\n\\nBut Raymon would not have it so. The first thing that he saw at the ball\\nwas the old marchioness\\'s haughty aigrette. In vain did he look for\\nIndiana\\'s white dress and black hair in her vicinity. He drew near and\\nheard her say in an undertone to another lady:\\n\\n\"My niece is ill; or rather,\" she added, to justify her own presence at\\nthe ball, \"it\\'s a mere girlish whim. She wanted to be left alone in the\\nsalon with a book in her hand, like a sentimental beauty.\"\\n\\n\"Can it be that she is avoiding me?\" thought Raymon. He left the ball at\\nonce. He hurried to the marchioness\\'s house, entered without speaking to\\nthe concierge, and asked the first servant that he saw, who was half\\nasleep in the antechamber, for Madame Delmare.\\n\\n\"Madame Delmare is ill.\"\\n\\n\"I know it. I have come at Madame de Carvajal\\'s request to see how she\\nis.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell madame.\"\\n\\n\"It is not necessary. Madame Delmare will receive me.\"\\n\\nAnd Raymon entered the salon unannounced. All the other servants had\\nretired. A melancholy silence reigned in the deserted apartments. A\\nsingle lamp, covered with its green silk shade, lighted the main salon\\ndimly. Indiana\\'s back was turned to the door; she was completely hidden\\nin the depths of a huge easy-chair, sadly watching the burning logs, as\\non the evening when Raymon entered the park of Lagny over the wall;\\nsadder now, for her former undefined sufferings, aimless desires had\\ngiven place to a fleeting joy, a gleam of happiness that was not for\\nher.\\n\\nRaymon, his feet encased in dancing shoes, approached noiselessly over\\nthe soft, heavy carpet. He saw that she was weeping, and, when she\\nturned her head, she found him at her feet, taking forcible possession\\nof her hands, which she struggled in vain to withdraw from his clasp.\\nThen, I agree, she was overjoyed beyond words to find that her scheme of\\nresistance had failed. She felt that she passionately loved this man who\\npaid no heed to obstacles and who had brought happiness to her in spite\\nof her efforts. She blessed heaven for rejecting her sacrifice, and,\\ninstead of scolding Raymon, she was very near thanking him.\\n\\nAs for him, he knew already that she loved him. He needed not to see the\\njoy that shone through her tears to realize that he was master, and that\\nhe could venture. He gave her no time to question him, but, changing\\nrôles with her, vouchsafing no explanation of his unlooked-for\\npresence, and no apology intended to make him seem less guilty than he\\nwas, he said:\\n\\n\"You are weeping, Indiana. Why do you weep? I insist upon knowing.\"\\n\\nShe started when he called her by her name; but there was additional joy\\nin the surprise which that audacity caused her.\\n\\n\"Why do you ask?\" she said. \"I must not tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I know, Indiana. I know your whole history, your whole life.\\nNothing that concerns you is unknown to me, because nothing that\\nconcerns you is indifferent to me. I resolved to know everything about\\nyou, and I have learned nothing that was not revealed to me during the\\nbrief moment that I passed under your roof, when I was brought, all\\ncrushed and bleeding, to your feet, and your husband was angry to see\\nyou, so lovely and so kind, support me with your soft arms and pour balm\\nupon my wounds with your sweet breath. He was jealous? oh! I can readily\\nunderstand it; I should have been, in his place, Indiana; or rather, in\\nhis place, I would kill myself; for to be your husband, madame, to\\npossess you, to hold you in his arms, and not to deserve you, not to win\\nyour heart, is to be the most miserable or the most dastardly of men!\"\\n\\n\"O heaven! hush,\" she cried, putting her hand over his mouth; \"hush! for\\nyou make me guilty. Why do you speak to me of him? why seek to teach me\\nto curse him? If he should hear you! But I have said no evil of him; I\\nhave not authorized you to commit this crime! I do not hate him; I\\nesteem him, I love him!\"\\n\\n\"Say rather that you are horribly afraid of him; for the despot has\\nbroken your spirit, and fear has sat at your bedside ever since you\\nbecame that man\\'s prey. You, Indiana, profaned by the touch of that\\nboor, whose iron hand has bowed your head and ruined your life! Poor\\nchild! so young and so lovely, to have suffered so horribly! for you\\ncannot deceive me, Indiana, who look at you with other eyes than those\\nof the common herd; I know all the secrets of your destiny, and you\\ncannot hope to hide the truth from me. Let those who look at you because\\nyou are lovely say, when they notice your pallor and your melancholy:\\n\\'She is ill;\\'--well and good; but I, who follow you with my heart, whose\\nwhole soul encompasses you with solicitude and love, I am well aware\\nwhat your disease is. I know that, if God had willed it so, if he had\\ngiven you to me, unlucky wretch that I am, who deserve to have my head\\nbroken for having come so late, you would not be ill. On my life I\\nswear, Indiana, I would have loved you so that you would have loved me\\nthe same and that you would have blessed the chain that bound us. I\\nwould have carried you in my arms to prevent your feet from being\\nwounded; I would have warmed them with my breath. I would have held you\\nagainst my breast to save you from suffering. I would have given all my\\nblood to make up your lack of it, and if you had lost sleep with me, I\\nwould have passed the night saying soft words to you, smiling on you to\\nrestore your courage, weeping the while to see you suffer. When sleep\\nhad breathed upon your silken eyelids, I would have brushed them with my\\nlips to close them more softly, and I would have watched over you,\\nkneeling by your bed. I would have forced the air to caress you gently,\\ngolden dreams to throw flowers to you. I would have kissed noiselessly\\nyour lovely tresses, I would have counted with ecstatic joy the\\npalpitations of your breast, and, at your awakening, Indiana, you would\\nhave found me at your feet, guarding you like a jealous master, waiting\\nupon you as a slave, watching for your first smile, seizing upon your\\nfirst thought, your first glance, your first kiss.\"\\n\\n\"Enough! enough!\" said Indiana, agitated and quivering with emotion,\\n\"you make me faint.\"\\n\\nAnd yet, if people died of happiness, Indiana would have died at that\\nmoment.\\n\\n\"Do not speak so to me,\" she said--\"to me who am destined never to be\\nhappy; do not depict heaven upon earth to me who am doomed to die.\"\\n\\n\"To die!\" cried Raymon vehemently, seizing her in his arms; \"you, die!\\nIndiana! die before you have lived--before you have loved! No, you shall\\nnot die; I will not let you die, for my life is bound to yours\\nhenceforth. You are the woman of whom I dreamed, the purity that I\\nadored, the chimera that always fled from me, the bright star that shone\\nbefore me and said to me: \\'Go forward in this life of wretchedness and\\nheaven will send one of its angels to bear you company.\\' You were always\\ndestined for me; your soul was always betrothed to mine, Indiana! Men\\nand their iron laws have disposed of you; they have snatched from me the\\nmate God would have chosen for me, if God did not sometimes forget his\\npromises. But what do we care for men and laws if I love you still in\\nanother\\'s arms, if you can still love me, accursed and unhappy as I am\\nin having lost you! I tell you, Indiana, you belong to me; you are the\\nhalf of my heart, which has long been struggling to join the other half.\\nWhen you dreamed of a friend on Ile Bourbon, you dreamed of me; when, at\\nthe word husband, a sweet thrill of fear and hope passed through your\\nheart, it was because I was destined to be your husband. Do you not\\nrecognize me? Does not it seem to you that we must have met twenty years\\nago? Did I not recognize you, my angel, when you stanched my blood with\\nyour veil, when you placed your hand on my dying heart to bring back its\\nheat and its life? Ah! I remember distinctly enough. When I opened my\\neyes I said to myself: \\'There she is! she has been like that in all my\\ndreams--pale, melancholy and kind-hearted. She is my own; it is she who\\nis destined to fill my cup with unknown joys.\\' And the physical life\\nwhich returned to me then was your work. For we were brought together by\\nno commonplace circumstances, you see; it was neither chance nor\\ncaprice, but fatality, death, which opened the gates of this new life to\\nme. It was your husband--your master--who, guided by his destiny,\\nbrought me all bleeding in his arms and threw me at your feet, saying:\\n\\'Here is something for you!\\' And now nothing can part us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he can part us!\" hastily interposed Madame Delmare, who, carried\\naway by her lover\\'s transports, had listened to him in ecstasy. \"Alas!\\nalas! you do not know him; he is a man who knows nothing of pardon--a\\nman who cannot be deceived. He will kill you, Raymon!\"\\n\\nShe hid her face in his bosom, sobbing. Raymon embraced her\\npassionately.\\n\\n\"Let him come!\" he cried; \"let him come and snatch this moment of\\nhappiness from me! I defy him! Stay here, Indiana--here against my\\nheart; let it be your refuge and your protection. Love me and I shall be\\ninvulnerable. You know that it is not in that man\\'s power to kill me; I\\nhave already been exposed defenceless to his blows. But you, my good\\nangel, were hovering over me, and your wings protected me. Have no fear,\\nI say, we shall find a way to turn aside his wrath; and now I am not\\neven afraid for you, for I shall be at hand. And when this master of\\nyours attempts to oppress you, I will protect you against him. I will\\nrescue you, if necessary, from his cruel laws. Would you like me to kill\\nhim? Tell me that you love me, and I will be his executioner if you\\nsentence him to death.\"\\n\\n\"Hush! hush! you make me shudder! If you wish to kill some one, kill me;\\nfor I have lived one whole day and I ask nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Die, then, but let it be of happiness!\" cried Raymon, pressing his lips\\nto Indiana\\'s.\\n\\nBut the storm was too severe for so fragile a plant; she turned pale,\\nput her hand to her heart and swooned.\\n\\nAt first Raymon thought that his caresses would call her blood back into\\nher icy veins; but in vain did he cover her hand with kisses; in vain\\ndid he call her by the sweetest names. It was not a premeditated swoon\\nof the sort we so often see. Madame Delmare had been seriously ill for a\\nlong time, and was subject to nervous paroxysms which sometimes lasted\\nwhole hours. Raymon, in desperation, was reduced to the necessity of\\ncalling for help. He rang; a maid appeared; but the phial that she held\\nescaped from her hands, and a cry from her throat, when she recognized\\nRaymon. He, recovering instantly all his self-possession, put his mouth\\nto her ear.\\n\\n\"Hush, Noun! I knew that you were here and I came to see you. I did not\\nexpect to see your mistress, who was, as I supposed, at the ball. When I\\ncame in I frightened her and she fainted. Be prudent; I am going away.\"\\n\\nRaymon fled, leaving each of the two women in possession of a secret\\nwhich was destined to carry despair to the heart of the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Raymon, on waking, received a second letter from Noun.\\nHe did not toss this one disdainfully aside; on the contrary, he opened\\nit eagerly: it might have something to say of Madame Delmare. So, in\\nfact, it did; but in what an embarrassing position this complication of\\nintrigues placed Raymon! It had become impossible to conceal the girl\\'s\\nsecret. Already suffering and terror had thinned her cheeks. Madame\\nDelmare observed her ailing condition, but was unable to discover its\\ncause. Noun dreaded the colonel\\'s severity, but she dreaded her\\nmistress\\'s gentleness even more. She was very sure that she would obtain\\nforgiveness, but she would die of shame and grief in being forced to\\nmake the confession. What would become of her if Raymon were not careful\\nto protect her from the humiliations that were certain to overwhelm her!\\nHe must give some thought to her, or she would throw herself at Madame\\nDelmare\\'s feet and tell her the whole story.\\n\\nThe fear of this result had a powerful effect upon Monsieur de Ramière.\\nHis first thought was to separate Noun from her mistress.\\n\\n\"Be very careful not to speak without my consent,\" he wrote in reply.\\n\"Try and be in Lagny this evening. I will be there.\"\\n\\nOn his way thither he reflected as to the course he had better pursue.\\nNoun had common sense enough not to expect a reparation--that was out of\\nthe question. She had never dared to utter the word marriage, and\\nbecause she was discreet and generous, Raymon deemed himself less\\nguilty. He said to himself that he had not deceived her, and that Noun\\nmust have foreseen what her fate must be. The cause of Raymon\\'s\\nembarrassment was not any hesitation about offering the poor girl half\\nof his fortune; he was ready to enrich her, to take all the care of her\\nthat the most sensitive delicacy could suggest. What made his position\\nso painful was the necessity of telling her that he no longer loved her;\\nfor he did not know how to dissemble. Although his conduct at this\\ncrisis seems two-faced and treacherous, his heart was sincere, and had\\nalways been. He had loved Noun with his senses; he loved Madame Delmare\\nwith all his heart. Thus far he had lied to neither. His aim now was to\\navoid beginning to lie, and Raymon felt equally incapable of deceiving\\nNoun and of dealing her the fatal blow. He must make a choice between a\\ncowardly and a barbarous act. Raymon was very unhappy. He had come to no\\ndecision when he reached the gate of Lagny park.\\n\\nNoun, for her part, had not expected so prompt a reply, and had\\nrecovered a little hope.\\n\\n\"He still loves me,\" she said to herself, \"he doesn\\'t mean to abandon\\nme. He had forgotten me a little, that\\'s not to be wondered at; in\\nParis, in the midst of merrymaking, with all the women in love with him,\\nas they are sure to be, he has allowed himself to be led away from the\\npoor creole for a few moments. Alas! who am I that he should sacrifice\\nto me all those great ladies who are much lovelier and richer than I am?\\nWho knows,\" she said to herself artlessly, \"perhaps the Queen of France\\nis in love with him!\"\\n\\nBy dint of meditating upon the seductions which luxurious surroundings\\nprobably exerted on her lover, Noun thought of a scheme for making\\nherself more agreeable to him. She arrayed herself in her mistress\\'s\\nclothes, lighted a great fire in the room that Madame Delmare occupied\\nat Lagny, decorated the mantel with the loveliest flowers she could find\\nin the greenhouse, prepared a collation of fruit and choice wines, in a\\nword resorted to all the dainty devices of the boudoir, of which she had\\nnever thought before; and when she looked at herself in a great mirror,\\nshe did herself no more than justice in deciding that she was fairer\\nthan the flowers with which she had sought to embellish her charms.\\n\\n\"He has often told me,\" she said to herself, \"that I needed no ornaments\\nto make me lovely, and that no woman at court, in all the splendor of\\nher diamonds, was worth one of my smiles. And yet those same women that\\nhe used to despise fill his thoughts now. Come, I must be cheerful, I\\nmust seem lively and happy; perhaps I shall reconquer to-night all the\\nlove I once aroused in him.\"\\n\\nRaymon, having left his horse at a charcoal-burner\\'s cabin in the\\nforest, entered the park, to which he had a key. This time he did not\\nrun the risk of being taken for a thief; for almost all the servants had\\ngone with their masters, he had taken the gardener into his confidence,\\nand he knew all the approaches to Lagny as well as those to his own\\nestate.\\n\\nIt was a cold night; the trees in the park were enveloped in a dense\\nmist, and Raymon could hardly distinguish their black trunks through the\\nwhite mist which swathed them in diaphanous robes. He wandered some time\\nthrough the winding paths before he found the door of the summer-house\\nwhere Noun awaited him. She was wrapped in a pelisse with the hood\\nthrown over her head.\\n\\n\"We cannot stay here,\" she said, \"it is too cold. Follow me and do not\\nspeak.\"\\n\\nRaymon felt an extreme reluctance to enter Madame Delmare\\'s house as the\\nlover of her maid. However, he could not but comply; Noun was walking\\nlightly away in front of him, and this interview was to be the last.\\n\\nShe led him across the courtyard, quieted the dogs, opened the doors\\nnoiselessly, and, taking his hand, guided him in silence through the\\ndark corridors; at last she ushered him into a circular room, furnished\\nsimply but with refinement, where flowering orange-bushes exhaled their\\nsweet perfume; transparent wax candles were burning in the candelabra.\\n\\nNoun had strewn the floor with the petals of Bengal roses, the divan was\\ncovered with violets, a subtle warmth entered at every pore, and the\\nglasses gleamed on the table amid the fruit, whose ruddy cheeks were\\ndaintily blended with green moss.\\n\\nDazzled by the sudden transition from darkness to brilliant light,\\nRaymon stood for a moment bewildered; but it was not long ere he\\nrealized where he was. The exquisite taste and chaste simplicity which\\ncharacterized the furniture; the love stories and books of travel\\nscattered over the mahogany shelves; the embroidery frame covered with a\\nbright, pretty piece of work, the diversion of hours of patient\\nmelancholy; the harp whose strings seemed still to quiver with strains\\nof love and longing; the engravings representing the pastoral attachment\\nof Paul and Virginie, the peaks of Ile Bourbon and the blue shores of\\nSaint-Paul; and, above all, the little bed half-hidden behind its muslin\\ncurtains, as white and modest as a maiden\\'s bed, and over the headboard,\\nby way of consecrated boxwood, a bit of palm, taken perhaps from some\\ntree in her native island, on the day of her departure;--all these\\nrevealed the presence of Madame Delmare, and Raymon was seized with a\\nstrange thrill as he thought that that cloak-enveloped woman who had led\\nhim thither might be Indiana herself. This extravagant supposition\\nseemed to be confirmed when he saw, in the mirror opposite, a white\\nfigure, the phantom of a woman entering a ball-room and laying aside her\\ncloak, to appear, radiant and half-nude, in the dazzling light. But it\\nwas only a momentary error--Indiana would have concealed her charms more\\ncarefully; her modest bosom would have been visible only through the\\ntriple gauze veil of her corsage; she would perhaps have dressed her\\nhair with natural camellias, but they would not have frisked about on\\nher head in such seductive disorder; she might have encased her feet in\\nsatin shoes, but her chaste gown would not have betrayed thus\\nshamelessly the mysteries of her shapely legs.\\n\\nTaller and more powerfully built than her mistress, Noun was dressed,\\nnot clothed in her finery. She was graceful but lacked nobility of\\nbearing; she was lovely with the loveliness of women, not of fairies;\\nshe invited pleasure and gave no promise of sublime bliss.\\n\\nRaymon, after scrutinizing her in the mirror without turning his head,\\nturned his eyes upon everything that was calculated to give forth a\\npurer reflection of Indiana--the musical instruments, the paintings, the\\nnarrow, maidenly bed. He was intoxicated by the vague perfume her\\npresence had left behind in that sanctuary; he shuddered with desire as\\nhe thought of the day when Indiana herself should throw open its\\ndelights to him; and Noun, standing behind him with her arms folded,\\ngazed ecstatically at him, fancying that he was overwhelmed with delight\\nat the sight of all the pains she had taken to please him.\\n\\nBut he broke the silence at last.\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" he said, \"for all the preparations you have made for me;\\nI thank you especially for bringing me here, but I have enjoyed this\\npleasant surprise long enough. Let us leave this room; we are not in our\\nproper place here, and I must have some respect for Madame Delmare, even\\nin her absence.\"\\n\\n\"That is very cruel,\" said Noun, who did not understand him, but\\nremarked his cold and displeased manner; \"it is very hard to have had\\nsuch hopes of pleasing you and to see that you spurn me.\"\\n\\n\"No, dear Noun, I shall never spurn you; I came here to have a serious\\ntalk with you and to show you the deep affection that I owe you. I am\\ngrateful for your desire to please me; but I loved you better adorned by\\nyour youth and your natural charms than in this borrowed finery.\"\\n\\nNoun half understood and wept.\\n\\n\"I am a miserable creature,\" she said; \"I hate myself, for I no longer\\nplease you. I should have foreseen that you would not love me long,\\nbeing, as I am, a poor, uneducated girl. I do not reproach you for\\nanything. I knew well enough that you would not marry me; but if you\\nwould have kept on loving me, I would have sacrificed everything without\\na regret, endured everything without complaining. Alas! I am ruined! I\\nam dishonored! perhaps I shall be turned out-of-doors. I am going to\\ngive life to a creature who will be even more unfortunate than I am, and\\nno one will pity me. Everyone will feel that he has a right to trample\\non me. But I would joyfully submit to all that, if you still loved me.\"\\n\\nNoun talked thus a long while. Perhaps she did not repeat the same\\nwords, but she said the same things, and said them a hundred times more\\neloquently than I can say them. Where are we to look for the secret of\\nthe eloquence which suddenly reveals itself to an ignorant,\\ninexperienced mind in the crisis of a genuine passion and a profound\\nsorrow? At such times words have a greater value than in all the other\\nscenes of life; at such times trivial words become sublime by reason of\\nthe sentiment that dictates them and the accent with which they are\\nspoken. At such times the woman of the lowest rank, abandoning herself\\nto the frenzy of her emotions, becomes more pathetic and more convincing\\nthan her to whom education has taught moderation and reserve.\\n\\nRaymon was flattered to find that he had inspired so generous an\\nattachment, and gratitude, compassion, perhaps a little vanity,\\nrekindled love for a moment.\\n\\nNoun was suffocated by her tears; she had torn the flowers from her hair\\nwhich fell in disorder over her broad and dazzling shoulders. If Madame\\nDelmare had not had her slavery and her sufferings to heighten her\\ncharms, Noun would have surpassed her immeasurably in beauty at that\\nmoment; she was resplendent with grief and love. Raymon was vanquished;\\nhe drew her into his arms, made her sit beside him on the sofa, moved\\nthe little decanter-laden table nearer to them, and poured a few drops\\nof orange-flower water in a silver cup for her. Comforted by this mark\\nof interest far more than by the calming potion, Noun wiped away her\\ntears and threw herself at Raymon\\'s feet.\\n\\n\"Do love me,\" she said, passionately embracing his knees; \"tell me that\\nyou still love me and I shall be cured, I shall be saved. Kiss me as you\\nused to, and I will not regret having ruined myself to give you a few\\ndays of pleasure.\"\\n\\nShe threw her cool, brown arms about him, she covered him with her long\\nhair; her great black eyes emitted a burning languor and betrayed that\\nardor of the blood, that purely oriental lust which is capable of\\ntriumphing over all the efforts of the will, all the chaste delicacy of\\nthe thought. Raymon forgot everything--his resolutions, his new love and\\nhis surroundings. He returned Noun\\'s delirious caresses. He moistened\\nhis lips at the same cup, and the heady wines which were close at hand\\ncompleted the dethronement of their reason.\\n\\nLittle by little a vague and shadowy memory of Indiana was blended with\\nRaymon\\'s drunkenness. The two glass panels which repeated Noun\\'s image\\n_ad infinitum_ seemed to be peopled by a thousand phantoms. He gazed\\ninto the depths of that multiple reflection, looking for a slenderer\\nfigure there, and it seemed to him that he could distinguish, in the\\nlast hazy and confused shadow of Noun\\'s image the graceful and willowy\\nform of Madame Delmare.\\n\\nNoun, herself bewildered by the strong liquors which she knew not how to\\nuse, no longer noticed her lover\\'s strange remarks. If she had not been\\nas drunk as he, she would have understood that in his wildest flights\\nRaymon was thinking of another woman. She would have seen him kiss the\\nscarf and the ribbons Indiana had worn, inhale the perfume which\\nreminded him of her, crumple in his burning hands the tissue that had\\ncovered her breast; but Noun appropriated all these transports to\\nherself, when Raymon saw naught of her but Indiana\\'s dress. If he kissed\\nher black hair, he fancied that he was kissing Indiana\\'s black hair. It\\nwas Indiana whom he saw in the fumes of the punch which Noun\\'s hand had\\nlighted; it was she who smiled upon him and beckoned him from behind\\nthose white muslin curtains; and it was she of whom he dreamed upon that\\nchaste and spotless bed, when, yielding to the influence of love and\\nwine, he led thither his dishevelled creole.\\n\\nWhen Raymon woke, a sort of half light was shining through the cracks of\\nthe shutters, and he lay a long while without moving, absorbed by a\\nvague feeling of surprise and gazing at the room in which he was and the\\nbed in which he had slept, as if they were a vision of his slumber.\\nEverything in Madame Delmare\\'s chamber had been put in order. Noun, who\\nhad fallen asleep the sovereign mistress of that place, had waked in the\\nmorning a lady\\'s-maid once more. She had taken away the flowers and put\\nthe remains of the collation out of sight; the furniture was all in\\nplace, nothing suggested the amorous debauch of the night, and Indiana\\'s\\nchamber had resumed its innocent and virtuous aspect.\\n\\nOverwhelmed with shame, he rose and attempted to leave the room, but he\\nwas locked in; the window was thirty feet from the ground, and he must\\nneeds remain in that remorse-laden atmosphere, like Ixion on his wheel.\\nThereupon he fell on his knees with his face toward that disarranged,\\ntumbled bed which made him blush.\\n\\n\"O Indiana!\" he cried, wringing his hands, \"how I have outraged you! Can\\nyou ever forgive me for such infamous conduct? Even if you should\\nforgive me, I can never forgive myself. Resist me now, my gentle,\\ntrustful Indiana; for you do not know the baseness and brutality of the\\nman to whom you would surrender the treasures of your innocence! Repulse\\nme, trample on me, for I have not respected the sanctuary of your sacred\\nmodesty; I have befuddled myself with your wine like a footman, sitting\\nbeside your maid; I have sullied your spotless robe with my accursed\\nbreath, and your chaste girdle with my infamous kisses on another\\'s\\nbreast; I have not shrunk from poisoning the repose of your lonely\\nnights, and from shedding, even upon this bed, which your husband\\nhimself respected, the influences of seduction and adultery! What safety\\nwill you find henceforth behind these curtains whose mysteries I have\\nnot shrunk from profaning? What impure dreams, what bitter and consuming\\nthoughts will cling fast to your brain and wither it! What phantoms of\\nvice and shamelessness will crawl upon the virginal linen of your couch!\\nAnd your sleep, pure as a child\\'s--what chaste divinity will care to\\nprotect it now? Have I not put to flight the angel who guarded your\\npillow? Have I not thrown your alcove open to the demon of lust? Have I\\nnot sold him your soul? And will not the insane passion which consumes\\nthe vitals of this lascivious creole cling to yours, like Dejanira\\'s\\nrobe and gnaw at them! Oh! miserable wretch! miserable, guilty wretch\\nthat I am! if only I could wash away with my blood the stain I have left\\non this couch!\"\\n\\nAnd Raymon sprinkled it with his tears.\\n\\nAt that moment Noun returned, in her neckerchief and apron; she fancied,\\nwhen she saw Raymon kneeling, that he was praying. She did not know that\\nsociety people do not pray. She stood waiting in silence, until he\\nshould deign to notice her presence.\\n\\nRaymon, when he saw her, had a feeling of embarrassment and irritation,\\nbut without the courage to scold her, without the strength to say a\\nfriendly word to her.\\n\\n\"Why did you lock me in this room?\" he said at last. \"Do you forget that\\nit is broad daylight and that I cannot go out without compromising you\\nopenly?\"\\n\\n\"So you\\'re not to go out,\" said Noun caressingly. \"The house is deserted\\nand no one can see you; the gardener never comes to this part of the\\nbuilding to which I alone have the keys. You must stay with me all day;\\nyou are my prisoner.\"\\n\\nThis arrangement drove Raymon to despair; he had no other feeling for\\nhis mistress than a sort of aversion. However, he could do nothing but\\nsubmit, and it may be that, notwithstanding what he suffered in that\\nroom, an invincible attraction detained him there.\\n\\nWhen Noun left him to go and find something for breakfast, he set about\\nexamining by daylight all those dumb witnesses of Indiana\\'s solitude. He\\nopened her books, turned the leaves of her albums, then closed them\\nprecipitately; for he still shrank from committing a profanation and\\nviolating some feminine mystery. At last he began to pace the room and\\nnoticed, on the wooden panel opposite Madame Delmare\\'s bed, a large\\npicture, richly framed and covered with a double thickness of gauze.\\n\\nPerhaps it was Indiana\\'s portrait. Raymon, in his eagerness to see it,\\nforgot his scruples, stepped on a chair, removed the pins, and was\\namazed to see a full-length portrait of a handsome young man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\n\"It seems to me that I know that face,\" he said to Noun, struggling to\\nassume an indifferent attitude.\\n\\n\"Fi! monsieur,\" said the girl, as she placed on a table the tray that\\nshe brought containing the breakfast; \"it is not right to try and find\\nout my mistress\\'s secrets.\"\\n\\nThis remark made Raymon turn pale.\\n\\n\"Secrets!\" he said. \"If this is a secret, it has been confided to you,\\nNoun, and you were doubly guilty in bringing me to this room.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, it\\'s not a secret,\" said Noun with a smile; \"for Monsieur\\nDelmare himself assisted in hanging Sir Ralph\\'s portrait on that panel.\\nAs if madame could have any secrets with a husband so jealous!\"\\n\\n\"Sir Ralph, you say? Who is Sir Ralph?\"\\n\\n\"Sir Rodolphe Brown, madame\\'s cousin, her playmate in childhood, and my\\nown, too, I might say; he is such a good man!\"\\n\\nRaymon scrutinized the picture with surprise and some uneasiness.\\n\\nWe have said that Sir Ralph was an extremely comely person, physically;\\nwith a red and white complexion and abundant hair, a tall figure, always\\nperfectly dressed, and capable, if not of turning a romantic brain, of\\nsatisfying the vanity of an unromantic one. The peaceable baronet was\\nrepresented in hunting costume, about as we saw him in the first chapter\\nof this narrative, and surrounded by his dogs, the beautiful pointer\\nOphelia in the foreground, because of the fine silver-gray tone of her\\nsilky coat and the purity of her Scotch blood. Sir Ralph had a\\nhunting-horn in one hand and in the other the rein of a superb,\\ndapple-gray English hunter, who filled almost the whole background of\\nthe picture. It was an admirably executed portrait, a genuine family\\npicture with all its perfection of detail, all its puerile niceties of\\nresemblance, all its bourgeois minutiæ; a picture to make a nurse weep,\\ndogs bark and a tailor faint with joy. There was but one thing on earth\\nmore insignificant than the portrait, and that was the original.\\n\\nNevertheless it kindled a violent flame of wrath in Raymon.\\n\\n\"Upon my word!\" he said to himself, \"this dapper young Englishman enjoys\\nthe privilege of being admitted to Madame Delmare\\'s most secret\\napartment! His vapid face is always here, looking coldly on at the most\\nprivate acts of her life! He watches her, guards her, follows her every\\nmovement, possesses her every hour in the day! At night he watches her\\nasleep and surprises the secret of her dreams; in the morning, when she\\ncomes forth, all white and quivering, from her bed, he sees the dainty\\nbare foot that steps lightly on the carpet; and when she dresses with\\nall precaution--when she draws the curtains at her window and forbids\\neven the daylight from entering her presence too boldly--when she\\nbelieves that she is quite alone, hidden from every eye--that insolent\\nface is there, feasting on her charms! That man, all booted and spurred,\\npresides over her toilet. Is this gauze usually spread over the\\npicture?\" he asked the maid.\\n\\n\"Always,\" she replied, \"when madame is absent. But don\\'t take the\\ntrouble to replace it, for madame is coming in a few days.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, Noun, you would do well to tell her that the expression\\nof the face is very impertinent. If I had been in Monsieur Delmare\\'s\\nplace I wouldn\\'t have consented to leave it here unless I had cut out\\nthe eyes. But that\\'s just like the stupid jealousy of the ordinary\\nhusband! They imagine everything and understand nothing.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, what have you against good Monsieur Brown\\'s face?\"\\nsaid Noun, as she made her mistress\\'s bed; \"he is such an excellent\\nmaster! I used not to care much for him, because I always heard madame\\nsay that he was selfish; but ever since the day that he took care of\\nyou----\"\\n\\n\"True,\" Raymon interrupted her, \"it was he who helped me that day; I\\nremember him perfectly now. But I owe his interest only to Madame\\nDelmare\\'s prayers.\"\\n\\n\"Because she is so kind-hearted,\" said poor Noun. \"Who could help being\\nkind-hearted after living with her?\"\\n\\nWhen Noun spoke of Madame Delmare, Raymon listened with an interest of\\nwhich she had no suspicion.\\n\\nThe day passed quietly enough, but Noun dared not lead the conversation\\nto her real object. At last, toward evening, she made an effort and\\ncompelled him to declare his intentions.\\n\\nRaymon had no other intention than to rid himself of a dangerous witness\\nand of a woman whom he no longer loved. But he proposed to assure her\\nfuture, and in fear and trembling he made her the most liberal offers.\\n\\nIt was a bitter affront to the poor girl; she tore her hair, and would\\nhave beaten her head against the wall if Raymon had not put forth all\\nhis strength to hold her. Thereupon, employing all the resources of\\nlanguage and intellect with which nature had endowed him, he made her\\nunderstand that it was not for her, but for the child she was to bring\\ninto the world, that he desired to make provision.\\n\\n\"It is my duty,\" he said; \"I hand the funds over to you as the child\\'s\\nheritage, and you would fail in your duty to him if a false sense of\\ndelicacy should lead you to reject them.\"\\n\\nNoun became calmer and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" she said, \"I will accept the money if you will promise to\\nkeep on loving me; for, just by doing your duty to the child, you will\\nnot do it to the mother. Your gift will keep him alive, but your\\nindifference will kill me. Can\\'t you take me into your service? I am not\\nexacting; I don\\'t aspire to all that another woman in my place might\\nhave had the skill to obtain. But let me be your servant. Obtain a place\\nfor me in your mother\\'s family. She will be satisfied with me, I give\\nyou my word; and, even if you don\\'t love me, I shall at least see you.\"\\n\\n\"What you ask is impossible, my dear Noun. In your present condition you\\ncannot think of entering anyone\\'s service; and to deceive my mother--to\\nplay upon her confidence in me--would be a base act to which I shall\\nnever consent. Go to Lyon or Bordeaux; I will undertake to see to it\\nthat you want nothing until such time as you can show yourself again.\\nThen I will obtain a place for you with some one of my acquaintances--at\\nParis, if you wish, if you insist upon being near me--but as to living\\nunder the same roof, that is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\" echoed Noun, wringing her hands in a passion of grief. \"I\\nsee that you despise me--that you blush for me. But no, I will not go\\naway, alone and degraded, to die abandoned in some distant city where\\nyou will forget me. What do I care for my reputation? Your love is what\\nI wanted to retain.\"\\n\\n\"Noun, if you fear that I am deceiving you, come with me. The same\\ncarriage shall take us to whatever place you choose. I will go with you\\nanywhere, except to Paris or to my mother\\'s, and I will bestow upon you\\nall the care and attention that I owe you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to abandon me on the day after you have put me down, a useless\\nburden, in some foreign land!\" she rejoined, smiling bitterly. \"No,\\nmonsieur, no, I will stay here; I do not choose to lose everything at\\nonce. I should sacrifice, by following you, the person whom I loved best\\nin the world before I knew you; but I am not anxious enough to conceal\\nmy dishonor to sacrifice both my love and my friendship. I will go and\\nthrow myself at Madame Delmare\\'s feet; I will tell her all, and she will\\nforgive me, I know, for she is kind and she loves me. We were born on\\nalmost the same day, and she is my foster-sister. We have never been\\nseparated, and she will not want me to leave her. She will weep with me;\\nshe will take care of me, and she will love my child--my poor child! Who\\nknows! she has not the good fortune to be a mother; perhaps she will\\nbring it up as her own! Ah! I was mad to think of leaving her, for she\\nis the only person on earth who will take pity on me!\"\\n\\nThis determination plunged Raymon in horrible perplexity; but suddenly\\nthe rumbling of a carriage was heard in the courtyard. Noun, in dismay,\\nran to the window.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Madame Delmare!\" she cried; \"go instantly!\"\\n\\nIn that moment of excitement the key to the secret staircase could not\\nbe found. Noun took Raymon\\'s arm and hurriedly pulled him into the hall;\\nbut they were not half way to the stairs when they heard footsteps in\\nthe same passage; they heard Madame Delmare\\'s voice ten steps in front\\nof them, and a candle carried by a servant who attended her cast its\\nflickering light almost on their terrified faces. Noun had barely time\\nto retrace her steps, still pulling Raymon after her, and to return with\\nhim to the bedroom.\\n\\nA dressing room, with a glass door, might afford a place of refuge for a\\nfew moments; but there was no way of locking the door, and it was\\npossible that Madame Delmare might go to the dressing room at once. To\\navoid being detected instantly, Raymon was obliged to rush into the\\nalcove and hide behind the curtains. It was not probable that Madame\\nDelmare would retire at once, and meanwhile Noun might find an\\nopportunity to help him to escape.\\n\\nIndiana bustled into the room, tossed her hat on the bed and kissed Noun\\nwith the familiarity of a sister. There was so little light in the room\\nthat she did not notice her companion\\'s emotion.\\n\\n\"You expected me, did you?\" she said, going to the fire; \"how did you\\nknow I was coming?--Monsieur Delmare,\" she added, not waiting for a\\nreply, \"will be here to-morrow. I started at once on receiving his\\nletter. I have certain reasons for receiving him here and not in Paris.\\nI will tell you what they are. But, in heaven\\'s name, why don\\'t you\\nspeak to me? you don\\'t seem so glad to see me as usual.\"\\n\\n\"I am low-spirited,\" said Noun, kneeling by her mistress to remove her\\nshoes. \"I have something to tell you, too, but later; come to the salon\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid! what an idea! it\\'s deathly cold there!\"\\n\\n\"No, there\\'s a good fire.\"\\n\\n\"You are dreaming! I just came through it.\"\\n\\n\"But your supper is waiting for you.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any supper; besides, there is nothing ready. Go and get my\\nboa, I left it in the carriage.\"\\n\\n\"In a moment.\"\\n\\n\"Why not now? Go, I say, go!\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she pushed Noun toward the door with a playful air; and\\nthe maid, seeing that she must be bold and self-possessed, went out for\\na few moments. But she had no sooner left the room than Madame Delmare\\nthrew the bolt and removed her cloak, placing it on the bed beside her\\nhat. As she did it, she went so near to Raymon, that he instinctively\\nstepped back, and the bed, which apparently rested on well-oiled\\ncastors, moved with a slight noise. Madame Delmare was surprised but not\\nfrightened, for it was quite possible that she had herself moved the\\nbed; she stretched forth her neck, drew the curtain aside and revealed a\\nman\\'s head outlined against the wall in the half-light cast by the fire\\non the hearth.\\n\\nIn her terror she uttered a shriek and rushed to the mantel to seize the\\nbell-cord and summon help. Raymon would have preferred to be taken for a\\nthief again than to be recognized in that situation. But if he did not\\nmake himself known, Madame Delmare would call her servants and\\ncompromise her own reputation. He placed his trust in the love he had\\ninspired in her, and, rushing to her, tried to stop her shrieks and to\\nkeep her away from the bell-cord, saying to her in an undertone, for\\nfear of being heard by Noun, who was probably not far away:\\n\\n\"It is I, Indiana; look at me and forgive me! Indiana! forgive an\\nunhappy wretch whose reason you have led astray, and who could not make\\nup his mind to give you back to your husband until he had seen you once\\nmore.\"\\n\\nAnd while he held Indiana in his arms, no less in the hope of moving her\\nthan to keep her from ringing, Noun was knocking at the door in an agony\\nof apprehension. Madame Delmare, extricating herself from Raymon\\'s arms,\\nran and opened the door, then sank into a chair.\\n\\nPale as death and almost fainting, Noun threw herself against the door\\nto prevent the servants, who were running hither and thither, from\\ninterrupting this strange scene; paler than her mistress, with trembling\\nknees and her back glued to the door, she awaited her fate.\\n\\nRaymon felt that with due address he might still deceive both women at\\nonce.\\n\\n\"Madame,\" he said, falling on his knees before Indiana, \"my presence\\nhere must seem to you an outrageous insult; here at your feet I implore\\nyour forgiveness. Grant me an interview of a few moments and I will\\nexplain----\"\\n\\n\"Hush, monsieur, and leave this house,\" cried Madame Delmare, recovering\\nall the dignity befitting her situation; \"leave this house openly. Open\\nthe door, Noun, and allow monsieur to go, so that all my servants may\\nsee him and that the disgrace of such a proceeding may fall upon him.\"\\n\\nNoun, believing that she was detected, threw herself on her knees by\\nRaymon\\'s side. Madame Delmare looked at her in amazement, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\nRaymon tried to take her hand; but she indignantly withdrew it. Flushed\\nwith anger, she rose and pointed to the door.\\n\\n\"Go, I tell you!\" she said; \"go, for your conduct is despicable. So\\nthese are the means you chose to employ! you, monsieur, hiding in my\\nbedroom, like a thief! It seems that it is a habit of yours to introduce\\nyourself into families in this way! and this is the pure attachment that\\nyou offered me the night before last! This is the way you were to\\nprotect me, respect me and defend me! This is the way you worship me!\\nYou see a woman who has nursed you with her hands, who, to restore you\\nto life, defied her husband\\'s anger; you deceive her by a pretence of\\ngratitude, you promise her a love worthy of her, and as a reward for her\\nattentions, as the price of her credulity, you seek to surprise her in\\nher sleep and to hasten your triumph by indescribable infamy! You bribe\\nher maid, you almost creep into her bed, like a lover already favored;\\nyou do not shrink from admitting her servants to the secret of an\\nintimacy that does not exist. Go, monsieur; you have taken pains to\\nundeceive me very quickly! Go, I say! do not remain another moment under\\nmy roof! And you, wretched girl, who have so little regard for your\\nmistress\\'s honor--you deserve to be dismissed. Stand away from that\\ndoor, I tell you!\"\\n\\nNoun, half dead with surprise and despair, gazed fixedly at Raymon as if\\nto ask him for an explanation of this incredible mystery. Then, with a\\nwild gleam in her eyes, hardly able to stand, she dragged herself to\\nIndiana and seized her arm fiercely.\\n\\n\"What was that you said?\" she cried, her teeth clenched with rage; \"this\\nman loved you?\"\\n\\n\"Eh! you must have known that he did!\" said Madame Delmare, pushing her\\naway contemptuously and with all her strength; \"you must have known what\\nreasons a man has for hiding behind a woman\\'s curtains. Ah! Noun,\" she\\nadded, noticing the girl\\'s evident despair, \"it was a dastardly thing,\\nand one of which I would never have believed you to be capable; you\\nconsented to sell her honor who had such perfect faith in yours!\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare was shedding tears, tears of indignation as well as of\\ngrief. Raymon had never seen her so lovely; but he hardly dared look at\\nher, for her haughty air, the air of an insulted woman, forced him to\\nlower his eyes. He was terror-stricken, too, petrified by Noun\\'s\\npresence. If he had been alone with Madame Delmare, he might perhaps\\nhave been able to soften her. But Noun\\'s expression was terrifying; her\\nfeatures were distorted by rage and hatred.\\n\\nA knock at the door startled them all three. Noun rushed forward once\\nmore to keep out intruders; but Madame Delmare, pushing her aside\\nimperatively, motioned to Raymon to withdraw to the corner of the room.\\nThen, with the self-possession which made her so remarkable at critical\\nmoments, she wrapped herself in a shawl, partly opened the door herself,\\nand asked the servant who had knocked what he had to say to her.\\n\\n\"Monsieur Rodolphe Brown is here,\" was the reply; \"he wishes to know if\\nmadame will receive him.\"\\n\\n\"Say to Monsieur Rodolphe Brown that I am delighted that he has come and\\nthat I will join him at once. Make a fire in the salon and bid them\\nprepare some supper. One moment! Go and get the key to the small park.\"\\n\\nThe servant retired. Madame Delmare remained at the door, holding it\\nopen, not deigning to listen to Noun and imperiously enjoining silence\\non Raymon.\\n\\nThe servant returned in a few moments. Madame Delmare, still holding the\\ndoor open between him and Monsieur de Ramière, took the key from him,\\nbade him hurry up the supper, and, as soon as he had gone, turned to\\nRaymon.\\n\\n\"The arrival of my cousin, Sir Rodolphe Brown,\" she said, \"saves you\\nfrom the public scandal which I intended to inflict on you; he is a man\\nof honor, who would eagerly assume the duty of defending me; but as I\\nshould be very sorry to expose a man like him to danger at the hands of\\nsuch a man as you, I will allow you to go without scandal. Noun, who\\nadmitted you, will find a way to let you out. Go!\"\\n\\n\"We shall meet again, madame,\" replied Raymon with an attempt at\\nself-assurance; \"and although I am culpable, you will perhaps regret the\\nharshness with which you treat me now.\"\\n\\n\"I trust, monsieur, that we shall never meet again,\" she rejoined.\\n\\nAnd still standing at the door, not deigning to bow, she watched him\\ndepart with his miserable and trembling accomplice.\\n\\nWhen he was alone with Noun in the obscurity of the park, Raymon\\nexpected reproaches from her; but she did not speak to him. She led him\\nto the gate of the small park, and, when he tried to take her hand, she\\nhad already vanished. He called her in a low voice, for he was anxious\\nto learn his fate; but she did not reply, and the gardener, suddenly\\nappearing, said to him:\\n\\n\"Come, monsieur, you must be off; madame is here and you may be\\ndiscovered.\"\\n\\nRaymon took his departure with death in his heart; but in his despair at\\nhaving offended Madame Delmare he almost forgot Noun and thought of\\nnothing but possible methods of appeasing her mistress; for it was a\\npart of his nature to be irritated by obstacles and never to cling\\npassionately except to things that were well-nigh desperate.\\n\\nAt night, when Madame Delmare, after supping silently with Sir Ralph,\\nwithdrew to her own apartments, Noun did not come, as usual, to undress\\nher; she rang for her to no purpose, and when she had concluded that the\\ngirl was resolved not to obey, she locked her door and went to bed. But\\nshe passed a horrible night, and, as soon as the day broke, went down\\ninto the park. She was feverish and agitated; she longed to feel the\\ncold enter her body and allay the fire that consumed her breast. The day\\nbefore, at that hour, she was happy, abandoning herself to the novel\\nsensations of that intoxicating love. What a ghastly disillusionment in\\ntwenty-four hours! First of all, the news of her husband\\'s return\\nseveral days earlier than she expected; those four or five days which\\nshe had hoped to pass in Paris were to her a whole lifetime of\\nnever-ending bliss, a dream of love never to be interrupted by an\\nawakening; but in the morning she had had to abandon the hope, to resume\\nthe yoke, and to go to meet her master in order that he might not meet\\nRaymon at Madame de Carvajal\\'s; for Indiana thought that it would be\\nimpossible for her to deceive her husband if he should see her in\\nRaymon\\'s presence. And then this Raymon, whom she loved as a god--it was\\nby him of all men that she was thus basely insulted! And lastly, her\\nlife-long companion, the young creole whom she loved so dearly, suddenly\\nproved to be unworthy of her confidence and her esteem!\\n\\nMadame Delmare had wept all night long. She sank upon the turf, still\\nwhitened by the morning rime, on the bank of the little stream that\\nflowed through the park. It was late in March and nature was beginning\\nto awake; the morning, although cold, was not devoid of beauty; patches\\nof mist still rested on the water like a floating scarf, and the birds\\nwere trying their first songs of love and springtime.\\n\\nIndiana felt as if relieved of a heavy weight, and a wave of religious\\nfeeling overflowed her soul.\\n\\n\"God willed it so,\" she said to herself; \"in His providence he has given\\nme a harsh lesson, but it is fortunate for me. That man would perhaps\\nhave led me into vice, he would have ruined me; whereas now the vileness\\nof his sentiments is revealed to me, and I shall be on my guard against\\nthe tempestuous and detestable passion that fermented in his breast. I\\nwill love my husband! I will try to love him! At all events I will be\\nsubmissive to him, I will make him happy by never annoying him, I will\\navoid whatever can possibly arouse his jealousy; for now I know what to\\nthink of the false eloquence that men know how to lavish on us. I shall\\nbe fortunate, perhaps, if God will take pity on my sorrows and send\\ndeath to me soon.\"\\n\\nThe clatter of the mill-wheel that started the machinery in Monsieur\\nDelmare\\'s factory made itself heard behind the willows on the other\\nbank. The river, rushing through the newly opened gates, began to boil\\nand bubble on the surface; and, as Madame Delmare followed with a\\nmelancholy eye the swift rush of the stream, she saw floating among the\\nreeds something like a bundle of cloth which the current strove to hurry\\nalong in its train. She rose, leaned over the bank and distinctly saw a\\nwoman\\'s clothes,--clothes that she knew too well. Terror nailed her to\\nthe spot; but the stream flowed on, slowly drawing a body from the reeds\\namong which it had caught, and bringing it toward Madame Delmare.\\n\\nA piercing shriek attracted the workmen from the factory to the spot;\\nMadame Delmare had fainted on the bank, and Noun\\'s body was floating in\\nthe water at her feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART SECOND\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\nTwo months have passed. Nothing is changed at Lagny, in that house to\\nwhich I introduced you one winter evening, except that all about its red\\nbrick walls with their frame of gray stone and its slated roofs yellowed\\nby venerable moss, the springtime is in its bloom. The family is\\nscattered here and there, enjoying the mild and fragrant evening air;\\nthe setting sun gilds the window-panes and the roar of the factory\\nmingles with the various noises of the farm. Monsieur Delmare is seated\\non the steps, gun in hand, practising at shooting swallows on the wing.\\nIndiana, at her embroidery frame near the window of the salon, leans\\nforward now and then to watch with a sad face the colonel\\'s cruel\\namusement in the courtyard. Ophelia leaps about and barks, indignant at\\na style of hunting so contrary to her habits; and Sir Ralph, astride the\\nstone railing, is smoking a cigar and, as usual, looking on impassively\\nat other people\\'s pleasure or vexation.\\n\\n\"Indiana,\" cried the colonel, laying aside his gun, \"do for heaven\\'s\\nsake put your work away; you tire yourself out as if you were paid so\\nmuch an hour.\"\\n\\n\"It is still broad daylight,\" Madame Delmare replied.\\n\\n\"No matter; come to the window, I have something to tell you.\"\\n\\nIndiana obeyed, and the colonel, drawing near the window, which was\\nalmost on a level with the ground, said to her with as near an approach\\nto playfulness of manner as an old and jealous husband can manage:\\n\\n\"As you have worked hard to-day and as you are very good, I am going to\\ntell you something that will please you.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare struggled hard to smile; her smile would have driven a\\nmore sensitive man than the colonel to despair.\\n\\n\"You will be pleased to know,\" he continued, \"that I have invited one of\\nyour humble adorers to breakfast with you to-morrow, to divert you. You\\nwill ask me which one; for you have a very pretty collection of them,\\nyou flirt!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s our dear old curé?\" said Madame Delmare, whose melancholy\\nwas enhanced by her husband\\'s gayety.\\n\\n\"Oh! no, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Then it must be the mayor of Chailly or the old notary from\\nFontainebleau.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the craft of women! You know very well that it would be none of\\nthose people. Come, Ralph, tell madame the name she has on the tip of\\nher tongue but doesn\\'t choose to pronounce herself.\"\\n\\n\"You need not go through so much preparation to announce a visit from\\nMonsieur de Ramière,\" said Sir Ralph, tranquilly, as he threw away his\\ncigar; \"I suppose that it\\'s a matter of perfect indifference to her.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare felt the blood rush to her cheeks; she made a pretence of\\nlooking for something in the salon, then returned to the window with as\\ncalm a manner as she could command.\\n\\n\"I fancy that this is a jest,\" she said, trembling in every limb.\\n\\n\"On the contrary I am perfectly serious; you will see him here at eleven\\no\\'clock to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"What! the man who stole into your premises to obtain unfair possession\\nof your invention, and whom you almost killed as a criminal! You must\\nboth be very pacific to forget such grievances!\"\\n\\n\"You set me the example, dearest, by receiving him very graciously at\\nyour aunt\\'s, where he called on you.\"\\n\\nIndiana turned pale.\\n\\n\"I do not by any means appropriate that call,\" she said earnestly, \"and\\nI am so little flattered by it that, if I were in your place, I would\\nnot receive him.\"\\n\\n\"You women are all false and cunning just for the pleasure of being so.\\nYou danced with him during one whole ball, I was told.\"\\n\\n\"You were misinformed.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it was your aunt herself who told me! However, you need not defend\\nyourself so warmly; I have no fault to find, as your aunt desired and\\nassisted to bring about this reconciliation between us. Monsieur de\\nRamière has been seeking it for a long while. He has rendered me some\\nvery valuable services with respect to my business, and he has done it\\nwithout ostentation and almost without my knowledge; so, as I am not so\\nsavage as you say, and also as I do not choose to be under obligations\\nto a stranger, I determined to make myself square with him.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"By making a friend of him; by going to Cercy this morning with Sir\\nRalph. We found his mother there, who seems a delightful woman; and the\\nhouse is furnished with refinement and comfort, but without ostentation\\nand without a trace of the pride that attaches to venerable names. After\\nall, this Ramière\\'s a good fellow, and I have invited him to come and\\nbreakfast with us and inspect the factory. I hear favorable accounts of\\nhis brother, and I have made sure that he cannot injure me by adopting\\nthe same methods that I use; so I prefer that that family should profit\\nby them rather than any other. You see no secrets are kept very long,\\nand mine will soon be like a stage secret if progress in manufacturing\\ncontinues at the present rate.\"\\n\\n\"For my part,\" said Sir Ralph, \"I have always disapproved of this\\nsecrecy, as you know; a good citizen\\'s discovery belongs to his country\\nas much as to himself, and if I----\"\\n\\n\"_Parbleu!_ that is just like you, Sir Ralph, with your practical\\nphilanthropy! You will make me think that your fortune doesn\\'t belong to\\nyou, and that, if the nation takes a fancy to it to-morrow, you are\\nready to exchange your fifty thousand francs a year for a wallet and\\nstaff! It looks well for a buck like you, who are as fond of the\\ncomforts of life as a sultan, to preach contempt of wealth!\"\\n\\n\"What I say,\" rejoined Sir Ralph, \"is not meant to be philanthropic at\\nall; my point is that selfishness properly understood leads us to do\\ngood to others to prevent them injuring us. I am selfish myself, as\\neverybody knows. I have accustomed myself not to blush for it, and,\\nafter analyzing all the virtues, I find personal interest at the\\nfoundation of them all. Love and devotion, which are two apparently\\ngenerous passions, are perhaps the most selfish passions that exist; nor\\nis patriotism less so, my word for it. I care little for men; but not\\nfor anything in the world would I undertake to prove it to them, my fear\\nof them is inversely proportional to my esteem for them. We are both\\nselfish therefore but I admit it, whereas you deny it.\"\\n\\nA discussion arose between them wherein each sought by all the arguments\\nof selfishness to demonstrate the selfishness of the others. Madame\\nDelmare took advantage of it to retire to her room and to abandon\\nherself to all the reflections to which news so entirely unexpected\\nnaturally gave birth.\\n\\nIt will be well not only to admit you to the secret of her thoughts, but\\nalso to enlighten you as to the situation of the various persons whom\\nNoun\\'s death had affected in greater or less degree.\\n\\nIt is almost proven, so far as the reader and I myself are concerned,\\nthat that unfortunate creature threw herself into the stream through\\ndespair, in one of those moments of frenzy when extreme resolutions are\\nmost easily formed. But, as she evidently did not return to the house\\nafter leaving Raymon--as no one had met her and had an opportunity to\\ndivine her purpose--there was no indication of suicide to throw light\\nupon the mystery of her death.\\n\\nTwo persons were in a position to attribute it with moral certainty to\\nher own act--Monsieur de Ramière and the gardener of Lagny. The grief\\nof the former was concealed beneath a pretence of illness; the terror\\nand remorse of the other enjoined silence upon him. This man who, from\\ncupidity, had connived at the intercourse of the lovers throughout the\\nwinter, was the only person who had been in a position to remark the\\nyoung creole\\'s secret misery. Justly fearing the reproaches of his\\nemployers and the criticisms of his equals, he held his peace in his own\\ninterest; and when Monsieur Delmare, who had some suspicions after the\\ndiscovery of this intrigue, questioned him as to the lengths to which it\\nhad been carried during his absence, he boldly denied that it had\\ncontinued at all. Some people in the neighborhood--a very lonely\\nneighborhood, by the way--had noticed Noun walking toward Crecy at\\nunreasonable hours; but apparently there had been no relations between\\nher and Monsieur de Ramière since the end of January, and her death\\noccurred on the 28th of March. So far as appeared, her death was\\nattributable to chance; as she was walking through the park at\\nnightfall, she might have been deceived by the dense fog that had\\nprevailed for several days, have lost her way and missed the English\\nbridge over the stream, which was quite narrow but had very steep banks\\nand was swollen by recent rains.\\n\\nAlthough Sir Ralph, who was more observant than his reflections\\nindicated, had found in his private thoughts grounds for strong\\nsuspicion of Monsieur de Ramière, he communicated them to no one,\\nregarding as useless and cruel any reproachful words addressed to a man\\nwho was so unfortunate as to have such a source of remorse in his life.\\nHe even succeeded in convincing the colonel, who expressed in his\\npresence some suspicions in that regard, that it was most urgent, in\\nMadame Delmare\\'s delicate condition, to continue to conceal from her the\\npossible causes of her old playmate\\'s suicide. So it was with the poor\\ngirl\\'s death as with her love affair. There was a tacit agreement never\\nto mention it before Indiana, and ere long it ceased to be talked about\\nat all.\\n\\nBut these precautions were of no avail, for Madame Delmare had her own\\nreasons for suspecting a part of the truth; the bitter reproaches she\\nhad heaped on the unhappy girl on that fatal evening seemed to her a\\nsufficient explanation of her sudden resolution. So it was that, at the\\nghastly moment when she discovered the dead body floating in the water,\\nIndiana\\'s repose, already so disturbed, and her heart, already so sad,\\nhad received the final blow; her lingering disease was progressing\\nactively; and this woman, young and perhaps strong, refusing to be\\ncured, concealing her sufferings from her husband\\'s undiscerning and far\\nfrom delicate affection, sank voluntarily beneath the burden of sorrow\\nand discouragement.\\n\\n\"Woe is me!\" she cried as she entered her room, after learning of\\nRaymon\\'s impending visit. \"A curse on that man, who has entered this\\nhouse only to bring despair and death! O God! why dost Thou permit him\\nto come between Thee and me, to take command of my destiny at his\\npleasure, so that he has only to put out his hand and say: \\'She is mine!\\nI will derange her reason, I will bring desolation into her life; and if\\nshe resists me I will spread mourning around her, I will encompass her\\nwith remorse, regrets and alarms!\\' O God! it is not fair that a poor\\nwoman should be so persecuted!\"\\n\\nShe wept bitterly; for the thought of Raymon revived the memory of Noun,\\nmore vivid and heartrending than ever.\\n\\n\"Poor Noun! my poor playmate! my countrywoman, my only friend!\" she\\nexclaimed sorrowfully; \"that man is your murderer. Unhappy child! his\\ninfluence was fatal to you as to me! You loved me so dearly, you were\\nthe only one who could divine my sorrows and mitigate them by your\\nartless gayety! Woe to me who have lost you! Was it for this that I\\nbrought you from so far away! By what wiles did that man surprise your\\ngood faith and induce you to do such a despicable thing? Ah! he must\\nhave deceived you shamefully, and you did not realize your error until\\nyou saw my indignation! I was too harsh, Noun, I was so harsh that I was\\ndownright cruel; I drove you to despair, I killed you! Poor girl! why\\ndid you not wait a few hours until the wind had blown away my resentment\\nlike a wisp of straw! Why did you not come and weep on my bosom and say:\\n\\'I was deceived; I acted without knowing what I was doing, but you know\\nwell enough that I respect you and love you!\\'--I would have taken you in\\nmy arms, we would have wept together, and you would not be dead. Dead!\\ndead so young and so lovely and so full of life! Dead at nineteen and\\nsuch a ghastly death!\"\\n\\nWhile thus weeping for her companion, Indiana, unknown to herself, wept\\nalso for her three days of illusion, the loveliest days of her life, the\\nonly days when she had really lived; for during those three days she had\\nloved with a passion which Raymon, had he been the most presumptuous of\\nmen, could never have imagined. But the blinder and more violent that\\nlove had been, the more keenly had she felt the insult she had received;\\nthe first love of a heart like hers contains so much modesty and\\nsensitive delicacy!\\n\\nAnd yet Indiana had yielded to a burst of shame and anger rather than to\\na well-matured determination. I have no doubt that Raymon would have\\nobtained his pardon had he been allowed a few more minutes in which to\\nplead for it. But fate had defeated his love and his address, and Madame\\nDelmare honestly believed now that she hated him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nFor his part, it was neither in a spirit of bravado nor because of the\\ninjury to his self-esteem that he aspired more ardently than ever to\\nMadame Delmare\\'s love and forgiveness. He believed that they were\\nunattainable, and no other woman\\'s love, no other earthly joy seemed to\\nhim their equivalent. Such was his nature. An insatiable craving for\\naction and excitement consumed his life. He loved society with its laws\\nand its fetters, because it offered him material for combat and\\nresistance; and if he had a horror of license and debauchery, it was\\nbecause they promised insipid and easily obtained pleasure.\\n\\nDo not believe, however, that he was insensible to Noun\\'s ruin. In the\\nfirst impulse, he conceived a horror of himself and loaded his pistols\\nwith a very real purpose of blowing out his brains; but a praiseworthy\\nfeeling stayed his hand. What would become of his mother, his aged,\\nfeeble mother, the poor woman whose life had been so agitated and so\\nsorrowful, who lived only for him, her only treasure, her only hope?\\nMust he break her heart, shorten the few years that still remained to\\nher? No, surely not. The best way to redeem his wrongdoing was to devote\\nhimself thenceforth solely to his mother, and it was with that purpose\\nin mind that he returned to her at Paris, and put forth all his energies\\nto make her forget his desertion of her during a large part of the\\nwinter.\\n\\nRaymon exerted an incredible influence over everybody about him; for,\\ntake him for all in all, with his faults and his youthful escapades, he\\nwas above the average of society men. We have not as yet told you upon\\nwhat his reputation for wit and talent was based, because it was aside\\nfrom the events we had to describe; but it is time to inform you that\\nthis Raymon, whose weaknesses you have followed and whose frivolity you\\nhave censured, is one of the men who have had the most control and\\ninfluence over your thoughts, whatever your opinions to-day may be. You\\nhave devoured his political pamphlets, and, while reading the newspapers\\nof the period, you have often been captivated by the irresistible charm\\nof his style and the grace of his courteous and worldly logic.\\n\\nI am speaking of a time already far away, in these days when time is no\\nlonger reckoned by centuries, nor even by reigns, but by ministries. I\\nam speaking of the Martignac year, of that epoch of repose and doubt,\\ninterjected in the middle of a political era, not like a treaty of\\npeace, but like an armistice; of those fifteen months of the reign of\\ndoctrines, which had such a strange influence on principles and on\\nmorals, and which may perhaps have paved the way for the extraordinary\\nresult of our latest revolution.\\n\\nIt was in those days that men saw the blooming of certain youthful\\ntalents, unfortunate in that they were born in a period of transition\\nand of compromise; for they paid their tribute to the conciliatory and\\nwavering tendencies of the time. Never, so far as I know, was knowledge\\nof mere words and ignorance, or pretended ignorance, of things carried\\nso far. It was the reign of restrictions, and it is beyond my power to\\nsay who made the fullest use of them, short-gowned Jesuits or\\nlong-gowned lawyers. Political moderation had become a part of the\\nnational character, like courteous manners, and it was the same with the\\nfirst variety of courtesy as with the second: it served as a mask for\\nsecret antipathies, and taught them how to fight without scandal and\\npublicity. We must say, however, in defence of the young men of that\\nperiod, that they were often towed like light skiffs in the wake of\\ngreat ships, with no very clear idea of where they were being taken,\\nproud and happy to be cleaving the waves and swelling out their new\\nsails.\\n\\nPlaced by his birth and his wealth among the partisans of absolute\\nroyalty, Raymon made a sacrifice to the _youthful_ ideas of his time by\\nclinging religiously to the Charter; at all events that was what he\\nthought that he was doing and what he exerted himself to prove. But\\nconventions that have fallen into desuetude are subject to\\ninterpretation, and the Charter of Louis XVIII was already in the same\\nplight as the Gospel of Jesus Christ; it was simply a text upon which\\neverybody practised his powers of eloquence, and a speech thereon\\ncreated a precedent no more than a sermon. A period of luxurious living\\nand indolence, when civilization lay sleeping on the brink of a\\nbottomless abyss, eager to enjoy its last pleasures.\\n\\nRaymon had taken his stand upon the line between abuse of power and\\nabuse of licence, a shifting ground upon which good men still sought,\\nbut in vain, a shelter from the tempest that was brewing. To him, as to\\nmany other experienced minds, the rôle of conscientious statesman still\\nseemed possible. A manifest error at a time when people pretended to\\ndefer to the voice of reason only to stifle it the more surely on every\\nside. Being without political passions, Raymon fancied that he was\\nwithout interests to promote; but he was mistaken, for society,\\nconstituted as it then was, was agreeable and advantageous to him; it\\ncould not be disturbed without a diminution in the sum total of his\\nwell-being, and that perfect contentment with one\\'s social position,\\nwhich communicates itself to the thought, is a wonderful promoter of\\nmoderation. Who is so ungrateful to Providence as to reproach it for the\\nmisfortunes of other people, if it has only smiles and benefactions for\\nhim? How was it possible to persuade those young supporters of the\\nconstitutional monarchy that the constitution was already antiquated,\\nthat it weighed heavily on the social body and fatigued it, while they\\nfound its burdens light and reaped only its advantages?\\n\\nNothing is so easy and so common as to deceive one\\'s self when one does\\nnot lack wit and is familiar with all the niceties of the language.\\nLanguage is a prostitute queen who descends and rises to all rôles,\\ndisguises herself, arrays herself in fine apparel, hides her head and\\neffaces herself; an advocate who has an answer for everything, who has\\nalways foreseen everything, and who assumes a thousand forms in order to\\nbe right. The most honorable of men is he who thinks best and acts best,\\nbut the most powerful is he who is best able to talk and write.\\n\\nAs his wealth relieved him from the necessity of writing for money,\\nRaymon wrote from a liking for it, and--he said it with perfect good\\nfaith--from a sense of duty. The rare faculty that he possessed, of\\nrefuting positive truth by sheer talent, had made him an invaluable man\\nto the ministry, whom he served much better by his impartial criticism\\nthan did its creatures by their blind devotion; and even more invaluable\\nto that fashionable young society which was quite willing to abjure the\\nabsurdities of its former privileges, but wished at the same time to\\nretain the benefit of its present advantageous position.\\n\\nThey were in very truth men of great talent who still supported society,\\ntottering on the brink of the precipice, and who, being themselves\\nsuspended between two reefs, struggled calmly and with perfect\\nself-possession against the harsh reality that was on the point of\\nengulfing them. To succeed in such wise as to create a conviction\\nagainst every sort of probability and to keep that conviction alive for\\nsome time among men of no convictions, is the art which most impresses\\nand surpasses the understanding of an uncultivated, vulgar mind which\\nhas studied none but commonplace truths.\\n\\nThus Raymon had no sooner returned to that society, which was his\\nelement and his home, than he felt its vital and exciting influences.\\nThe petty love affairs that had engrossed him vanished for a moment in\\nthe face of broader and more brilliant interests. He carried into these\\nthe same boldness of attack, the same ardor; and when he saw that he was\\nmore eagerly sought than ever by all the most distinguished people in\\nParis, he felt that he loved life more than ever. Was he to be blamed\\nfor forgetting a secret remorse while reaping the reward he had merited\\nfor services rendered his country? He felt life overflowing through\\nevery pore of his young heart, his active brain, his whole vigorous and\\nbuoyant being, he felt that destiny was making him happy in spite of\\nhimself; and he would crave forgiveness of an indignant ghost that came\\nsometimes and bewailed her fate in his dreams, for having sought in the\\naffection of the living a protection against the terrors of the grave.\\n\\nBut he had no sooner returned to life, as it were, than he felt, as in\\nthe past, the need of mingling thoughts of love and plans of intrigue\\nwith his political meditations, his dreams of ambition and philosophy. I\\nsay ambition, not meaning ambition for honor and wealth, for which he\\nhad no use, but for reputation and aristocratic popularity.\\n\\nHe had at first despaired of ever seeing Madame Delmare again after the\\ntragic ending of his double intrigue. But, as he measured the extent of\\nhis loss, as he brooded over the thought of the treasure that had\\nescaped him, he conceived the hope of grasping it once more, and, at the\\nsame time he regained determination and confidence. He calculated the\\nobstacles he should encounter, and realized that the most difficult to\\novercome at the outset would come from Indiana herself; therefore he\\nmust use the husband to protect him from the attack. This was not a new\\nidea, but it was sure; jealous husbands are particularly well adapted to\\nthis service.\\n\\nA fortnight after he had conceived this idea, Raymon was on the way to\\nLagny, where he was expected to breakfast. You will not require me to\\ndescribe to you in detail the shrewdly proffered services by which he\\nhad succeeded in making himself agreeable to Monsieur Delmare; I prefer,\\nas I am describing the features of the characters in this tale, to draw\\na hasty sketch of the colonel for you.\\n\\nDo you know what they call an _honest_ man in the provinces? He is a man\\nwho does not encroach on his neighbor\\'s field; who does not demand from\\nhis debtors a sou more than they owe him; who raises his hat to every\\nperson who bows to him; who does not ravish maidens in the public roads;\\nwho sets fire to no other man\\'s barn; who does not rob wayfarers at the\\ncorner of his park. Provided that he religiously respects the lives and\\npurses of his fellow-citizens, nothing more is demanded of him. He may\\nbeat his wife, maltreat his servants, ruin his children, and it is\\nnobody\\'s business. Society punishes only those acts which are injurious\\nto it; private life is beyond its jurisdiction.\\n\\nSuch was Monsieur Delmare\\'s theory of morals. He had never studied any\\nother social contract than this: _Every man is master in his own house._\\nHe treated all affairs of the heart as feminine puerilities, sentimental\\nsubtleties. Being a man devoid of wit, of tact and of education, he\\nenjoyed greater consideration than a man obtains by dint of talent and\\namiability. He had broad shoulders and a strong wrist; he handled the\\nsword and the sabre perfectly, and was exceedingly quick to take\\noffence. As he did not always understand a joke, he was constantly\\nhaunted by the idea that people were making fun of him. Being incapable\\nof suitable repartee, he had but one way of defending himself: to\\nenforce silence by threats. His favorite epigrams always turned upon\\ncowhidings to be administered and affairs of honor to be settled;\\nwherefore the province always prefixed to his name the epithet _brave_\\nbecause military valor apparently consists in having broad shoulders and\\nlong moustaches, in swearing fiercely, and in putting one\\'s hand to the\\nsword on the slightest pretext.\\n\\nGod forbid that I should believe that camp life makes all men brutes!\\nbut I may be permitted to believe that one must have a large stock of\\ntact and discretion to resist the habit of passive and brutal\\ndomination. If you have served in the army, you are familiar with what\\nthe troops call _skin-breeches_, and will agree that there are large\\nnumbers of them among the remains of the old imperial cohorts. Those men\\nwho, when brought together and urged forward by a powerful hand,\\nperformed such magnificent exploits, towered like giants amid the smoke\\nof the battle-field; but, having returned to civil life, the heroes\\nbecame mere soldiers once more, bold, vulgar fellows who reasoned like\\nmachines; and it was fortunate if they did not behave in society as in\\nconquered territory. It was the fault of the age rather than theirs.\\nIngenuous minds, they had faith in the adulation of victory, and allowed\\nthemselves to be persuaded that they were great patriots because they\\ndefended their country--some against their will, others for money and\\nhonors. But how did they defend it, those tens of thousands of men who\\nblindly embraced the error of a single man, and who, after saving their\\ncountry, basely destroyed it? And again, if a soldier\\'s devotion to his\\ncaptain seems to you a great and noble thing, well and good, so it does\\nto me; but I call that fidelity, not patriotism. I congratulate the\\nconquerors of Spain, I do not thank them. As for the honor of the French\\nname, I by no means understand that method of safeguarding it among\\nneighbors, and I find it difficult to believe that the Emperor\\'s\\ngenerals were very deeply engrossed by it at that deplorable stage of\\nour glory; but I know that we are forbidden to discuss these matters\\nimpartially; I hold my peace, posterity will pass judgment on them.\\n\\nMonsieur Delmare had all the good qualities and all the failings of\\nthese men. He was innocent to childishness concerning certain\\nrefinements of the point of honor, yet he was very well able to conduct\\nhis affairs to the best possible end without disturbing himself as to\\nthe good or evil which might result therefrom to others. His whole\\nconscience was the law; his whole moral code was his rights under the\\nlaw. His was one of those rigid, unbending probities which never borrow\\nfor fear of not returning, and never lend for fear of not recovering. He\\nwas the honest man who neither takes nor gives aught; who would rather\\ndie than steal a bundle of sticks in the king\\'s forest, but would kill\\nyou without ceremony for picking up a twig in his. He was useful to\\nhimself alone, harmful to nobody. He took part in nothing that was going\\non about him, lest he might be compelled to do somebody a favor. But,\\nwhen he deemed himself in honor bound to do it, no one could go about it\\nwith more energy and zeal and a more chivalrous spirit. At once trustful\\nas a child and suspicious as a despot, he would believe a false oath and\\ndistrust a sincere promise. As in the military profession, form was\\neverything with him. Public opinion governed him so exclusively that\\ncommon sense and argument counted for nothing in his decisions, and when\\nhe said: \"Such things are done,\" he thought that he had stated an\\nirrefutable argument.\\n\\nThus it will be seen that his nature was most antipathetic to his\\nwife\\'s, his heart entirely unfitted to understand her, his mind entirely\\nincapable of appreciating her. And yet it is certain that slavery had\\nengendered in her woman\\'s heart a sort of virtuous and unspoken aversion\\nwhich was not always just. Madame Delmare doubted her husband\\'s heart\\novermuch; he was only harsh and she deemed him cruel. There was more\\nroughness than anger in his outbreaks, more vulgarity than impertinence\\nin his manners. Nature had not made him evil-minded: he had moments of\\ncompassion which led him to repentance, and in his repentance he was\\nalmost sensitive. It was camp life that had raised brutality to a\\nprinciple in him. With a less refined, less gentle wife he would have\\nbeen as gentle as a tame wolf; but this woman was disheartened with her\\nfate; she did not take the trouble to try to make it happier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\nAs he alighted from his tilbury in the courtyard at Lagny, Raymon\\'s\\nheart failed him. So he was once more to enter that house which recalled\\nsuch awful memories! His arguments, being in accord with his passions,\\nmight enable him to overcome the impulses of his heart, but not to\\nstifle them, and at that moment the sensation of remorse was as keen as\\nthat of desire.\\n\\nThe first person who came forward to meet him was Sir Ralph Brown, and\\nwhen he spied him in his everlasting hunting costume, flanked by his\\nhounds and sober as a Scotch laird, he fancied that the portrait he had\\nseen in Madame Delmare\\'s chamber was walking before his eyes. A few\\nmoments later the colonel appeared, and the breakfast was served without\\nIndiana. As he passed through the vestibule, by the door of the billiard\\nroom, and recognized the places he had previously seen under such\\ndifferent circumstances, Raymon was so distressed that he could hardly\\nremember why he had come there now.\\n\\n\"Is Madame Delmare really not coming down?\" the colonel asked his\\nfactotum Lelièvre, with some asperity.\\n\\n\"Madame slept badly,\" replied Lelièvre, \"and Mademoiselle Noun--that\\ndevil of a name keeps coming to my tongue!--Mademoiselle Fanny, I mean,\\njust told me that madame is lying down now.\"\\n\\n\"How does it happen then that I just saw her at her window? Fanny is\\nmistaken. Go and tell madame that breakfast is served; or stay--Sir\\nRalph, my dear kinsman, be pleased to go up and see for yourself if your\\ncousin is really ill.\"\\n\\nWhile the unfortunate name that the servant had mentioned from habit\\ncaused Raymon\\'s nerves a painful thrill, the colonel\\'s expedient caused\\nhim a strange sensation of jealous anger.\\n\\n\"In her bedroom!\" he thought. \"He doesn\\'t confine himself to hanging the\\nman\\'s portrait there, but sends him there in person. This Englishman has\\nprivileges here which the husband himself seems to be afraid to claim.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let that surprise you,\" said Monsieur Delmare, as if he had\\ndivined Raymon\\'s reflections; \"Monsieur Brown is the family physician;\\nand then he\\'s our cousin too, a fine fellow whom we love with all our\\nhearts.\"\\n\\nRalph remained absent ten minutes. Raymon was distraught, ill at ease.\\nHe did not eat and kept looking at the door. At last the Englishman\\nreappeared.\\n\\n\"Indiana is really ill,\" he said; \"I told her to go back to bed.\"\\n\\nHe took his seat tranquilly and ate with a robust appetite. The colonel\\ndid likewise.\\n\\n\"This is evidently a pretext to avoid seeing me,\" thought Raymon. \"These\\ntwo men don\\'t suspect it, and the husband is more displeased than\\nworried about his wife\\'s condition. Good! my affairs are progressing\\nmore favorably than I hoped.\"\\n\\nThis resistance rearoused his determination and Noun\\'s image vanished\\nfrom the dismal hangings, which, at the beginning, had congealed his\\nblood with terror. Soon he saw nothing but Madame Delmare\\'s slender\\nform. In the salon he sat at her embroidery frame, examined the flowers\\nshe was making--talking all the while and feigning deep\\ninterest--handled all the silks, inhaled the perfume her tiny fingers\\nhad left upon them. He had seen the same piece of work before, in\\nIndiana\\'s bedroom; then it was hardly begun, now it was covered with\\nflowers that had bloomed beneath the breath of fever, watered by her\\ndaily tears. Raymon felt the tears coming to his own eyes, and, by\\nvirtue of some unexplained sympathy, sadly raising his eyes to the\\nhorizon, at which Indiana was in the habit of gazing in melancholy mood,\\nhe saw in the distance the white walls of Cercy standing out against a\\nbackground of dark hills.\\n\\nThe colonel\\'s voice roused him with a start.\\n\\n\"Well, my excellent neighbor,\" he said, \"it is time for me to pay my\\ndebt to you and keep my promises. The factory is in full swing and the\\nhands are all at work. Here are paper and pencils, so that you can take\\nnotes.\"\\n\\nRaymon followed the colonel, inspected the factory with an eager,\\ninterested air, made comments which proved that chemistry and mechanics\\nwere equally familiar to him, listened with incredible patience to\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s endless dissertations, coincided with some of his\\nideas, combated some others, and in every respect so conducted himself\\nas to persuade his guide that he took an absorbing interest in these\\nthings, whereas he was hardly thinking of them and all his thoughts were\\ndirected toward Madame Delmare.\\n\\nIt was a fact that he was familiar with every branch of knowledge, that\\nno invention was without interest for him; moreover he was forwarding\\nthe interests of his brother, who had really embarked his whole fortune\\nin a similar enterprise, although of much greater extent. Monsieur\\nDelmare\\'s technical knowledge, his only claim to superiority, pointed\\nout to him at that moment the best method of taking advantage of this\\ninterview.\\n\\nSir Ralph, who was a poor business man but a very shrewd politician,\\nsuggested during the inspection of the factory some economical\\nconsiderations of considerable importance. The workmen, being anxious to\\ndisplay their skill to an expert, surpassed themselves in deftness and\\nactivity. Raymon looked at everything, heard everything, answered\\neverything, and thought of nothing but the love affair that brought him\\nto that place.\\n\\nWhen they had exhausted the subject of machinery the discussion fell\\nupon the volume and force of the stream. They went out and climbed upon\\nthe dam, bidding the overseer raise the gates and mark the different\\ndepths.\\n\\n\"Monsieur,\" said the man, addressing Monsieur Delmare, who fixed the\\nmaximum at fifteen feet, \"I beg pardon, but we had it seventeen once\\nthis year.\"\\n\\n\"When was that? You are mistaken,\" said the colonel.\\n\\n\"Excuse me, monsieur, it was on the eve of your return from Belgium, the\\nvery night Mademoiselle Noun was found drowned; what I say is proved by\\nthe fact that the body passed over that dike yonder and did not stop\\nuntil it got here, just where monsieur is standing.\"\\n\\nSpeaking thus, with much animation, the man pointed to where Raymon\\nstood. The unhappy young man turned pale as death; he cast a horrified\\nglance at the water flowing at his feet; it seemed to him that the livid\\nface was reflected in it, that the body was still floating there; he had\\nan attack of vertigo and would have fallen into the river had not\\nMonsieur Brown caught his arm and pulled him away.\\n\\n\"Very good,\" said the colonel, who noticed nothing, and who gave so\\nlittle thought to Noun that he did not suspect Raymon\\'s emotion; \"but\\nthat was an extraordinary instance, and the average depth of the water\\nis--But what the devil\\'s the matter with you two?\" he inquired, suddenly\\ninterrupting himself.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" replied Sir Ralph; \"as I turned I trod on monsieur\\'s foot; I\\nam distressed, for I must have hurt him terribly.\"\\n\\nSir Ralph made this reply in so calm and natural a tone that Raymon was\\nconvinced that he thought he was telling the truth. A few courteous\\nwords were exchanged and the conversation resumed its course.\\n\\nRaymon left Lagny a few hours later without seeing Madame Delmare. It\\nwas better than he hoped; he had feared that he should find her calm and\\nindifferent.\\n\\nHowever he repeated his visit with no better success. That time the\\ncolonel was alone; Raymon put forth all the resources of his wit to\\ncaptivate him, and shrewdly descended to innumerable little acts of\\ncondescension--praised Napoléon, whom he did not like, deplored the\\nindifference of the government, which left the illustrious remnant of\\nthe Grande Armée in oblivion and something like contempt, carried\\nopposition tenets as far as his opinions would permit him to go, and\\nselected from his various beliefs those which were likely to flatter\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s. He even provided himself with a character different\\nfrom his real one, in order to attract his confidence. He transformed\\nhimself into a _bon vivant_, a \"hail fellow well met,\" a careless\\ngood-for-naught.\\n\\n\"What if that fellow should ever make a conquest of my wife!\" said the\\ncolonel to himself as he watched him drive away.\\n\\nThen he began to chuckle inwardly and to think that Raymon was a\\n_charming fellow._\\n\\nMadame de Ramière was at Cercy at this time: Raymon extolled Madame\\nDelmare\\'s charms and wit to her, and without urging her to call upon\\nher, had the art to suggest the thought.\\n\\n\"I believe she is the only one of my neighbors whom I do not know,\" she\\nsaid; \"and as I am a new arrival in the neighborhood it is my place to\\nbegin. We will go to Lagny together next week.\"\\n\\nThe appointed day arrived.\\n\\n\"She cannot avoid me now,\" thought Raymon.\\n\\nIn truth Madame Delmare could not escape the necessity of receiving him,\\nfor when she saw an elderly woman she did not know step from the\\ncarriage, she went out on the stoop herself to meet her. At the same\\nmoment she recognized Raymon in the man who accompanied her; but she\\nrealized that he must have deceived his mother to induce her to take\\nthat step, and her displeasure on that account gave her strength to be\\ndignified and calm. She received Madame de Ramière with a mixture of\\nrespect and affability; but her coldness to Raymon was so absolutely\\nglacial that he felt that he could not long endure it. He was not\\naccustomed to disdain and his pride took fire at being unable to conquer\\nwith a glance those who were prepossessed against him. Thereupon,\\ndeciding upon his course like a man who cared nothing for a woman\\'s\\nwhim, he asked permission to join Monsieur Delmare in the park and left\\nthe two women together.\\n\\nLittle by little, vanquished by the charm which a superior intellect,\\ncombined with a noble and generous heart, is capable of exerting even in\\nits least intimate relations, Indiana became affable, affectionate and\\nalmost playful with Madame de Ramière. She had never known her mother,\\nand Madame de Carvajal, despite her presents and her words of praise,\\nwas far from being a mother to her; so she felt a sort of fascination of\\nthe heart with Raymon\\'s mother.\\n\\nWhen he joined her as she was stepping into her carriage he saw Indiana\\nput to her lips the hand that Madame de Ramière offered her. Poor\\nIndiana felt the need of having some one to cling to. Everything that\\noffered a prospect of interest and of companionship in her lonely and\\nunhappy life was welcomed by her with the keenest delight; and then she\\nsaid to herself that Madame de Ramière would preserve her from the\\nsnare into which Raymon sought to lure her.\\n\\n\"I will throw myself into this good woman\\'s arms,\" she was thinking\\nalready, \"and, if necessary, I will tell her everything. I will implore\\nher to save me from her son, and her prudence will stand guard over him\\nand over me.\"\\n\\nSuch was not Raymon\\'s reasoning.\\n\\n\"Dear mother!\" he said to himself, as he drove back with her to Cercy,\\n\"her charm and her goodness of heart perform miracles. What do I not owe\\nto them already! my education, my success in life, my standing in\\nsociety. I lacked nothing but the happiness of owing to her the heart of\\nsuch a woman as Indiana.\"\\n\\nRaymon, as we see, loved his mother because of his need of her and of\\nthe well-being he owed to her; so do all children love their mothers.\\n\\nA few days later Raymon received an invitation to pass three days at\\nBellerive, a beautiful country seat owned by Sir Ralph Brown, between\\nCercy and Lagny, where it was proposed, in concert with the best hunters\\nof the neighborhood, to destroy a part of the game that was devouring\\nthe owner\\'s woods and gardens. Raymon liked neither Sir Ralph nor\\nhunting, but Madame Delmare did the honors of her cousin\\'s house on\\ngreat occasions, and the hope of meeting her soon decided Raymon to\\naccept the invitation.\\n\\nThe fact was that Sir Ralph did not expect Madame Delmare on this\\noccasion; she had excused herself on the ground of her wretched health.\\nBut the colonel, who took umbrage when his wife sought diversion on her\\nown account, took still greater umbrage when she declined such\\ndiversions as he chose to allow her.\\n\\n\"Do you want to make the whole province think that I keep you under lock\\nand key?\" he said to her. \"You make me appear like a jealous husband;\\nit\\'s an absurd rôle and one that I do not propose to play any longer.\\nBesides, what does this lack of courtesy to your cousin mean? Does it\\nbecome you, when we owe to his friendship the establishment and\\nprosperity of our business, to refuse him such a service? You are\\nnecessary to him and you hesitate! I cannot understand your whims. All\\nthe people whom I don\\'t like are sure of a hearty welcome from you; but\\nthose whom I esteem are unfortunate enough not to please you.\"\\n\\n\"That reproach has very little application to the present case, I should\\nsay,\" replied Madame Delmare. \"I love my cousin like a brother, and my\\naffection for him was of long standing when yours began.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, more of your fine words; but I know that you don\\'t find\\nhim sentimental enough, the poor devil! you call him selfish because he\\ndoesn\\'t like novels and doesn\\'t cry over the death of a dog. However,\\nhe\\'s not the only one. How did you receive Monsieur de Ramière? a\\ncharming young fellow, on my word! Madame de Carvajal introduces him to\\nyou and you receive him with the greatest affability; but I have the\\nill-luck to think well of him and you pronounce him unendurable, and\\nwhen he calls upon you, you go to bed! Are you trying to make me appear\\na perfect boor? It is time for this to come to an end and for you to\\nbegin to live like other people.\"\\n\\nRaymon deemed it inadvisable, in view of his plans, to show too much\\neagerness; threats of indifference are successful with almost all women\\nwho think that they are loved. But the hunting had been in progress\\nsince morning when he reached Sir Ralph\\'s, and Madame Delmare was not\\nexpected until dinner time. He employed the interval in preparing a plan\\nof action.\\n\\nIt occurred to him that he must find some method of justifying his\\nconduct, for the critical moment was at hand. He had two days before him\\nand he determined to apportion the time thus: the rest of the day that\\nwas nearly ended to make an impression, the next day to persuade and the\\nfollowing day to be happy. He even consulted his watch and calculated\\nalmost to an hour the time when his enterprise would succeed or fail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\\nHe had been two hours in the salon when he heard Madame Delmare\\'s sweet\\nand slightly husky voice in the adjoining room. By dint of reflecting on\\nhis scheme of seduction he had become as passionately interested as an\\nauthor in his subject or a lawyer in his cause, and the emotion that he\\nfelt at the sight of Indiana may be compared to that of an actor\\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of his rôle who finds himself in the\\npresence of the principal character of the drama and can no longer\\ndistinguish artificial stage effects from reality.\\n\\nShe was so changed that a feeling of sincere compassion found its way\\ninto Raymon\\'s being, amid the nervous tremors of his brain. Unhappiness\\nand illness had left such deep traces on her face that she was hardly\\npretty, and that he felt that there was more glory than pleasure to be\\ngained by the conquest. But he owed it to himself to restore this woman\\nto life and happiness.\\n\\nSeeing how pale and sad she was, he judged that he had no very strong\\nwill to contend against. Was it possible that such a frail envelope\\ncould conceal great power of moral resistance?\\n\\nHe reflected that it was necessary first of all to interest her in\\nherself, to frighten her concerning her depression and her failing\\nhealth, in order the more easily to open her mind to the desire and the\\nhope of a better destiny.\\n\\n\"Indiana!\" he began, with secret assurance perfectly concealed beneath\\nan air of profound melancholy, \"to think that I should find you in such\\na condition as this! I did not dream that this moment to which I have\\nlooked forward so long, which I have sought so eagerly, would cause me\\nsuch horrible pain!\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare hardly anticipated this language; she expected to\\nsurprise Raymon in the attitude of a confused and shrinking culprit; and\\nlo! instead of accusing himself--of telling her of his grief and\\nrepentance--his sorrow and pity were all for her! She must be sorely\\ncast down and broken in spirit to inspire compassion in a man who should\\nhave implored hers!\\n\\nA French woman--a woman of the world--would not have lost her head at\\nsuch a delicate juncture; but Indiana had no tact; possessed neither the\\nskill nor the power of dissimulation necessary to preserve the advantage\\nof her position. His words brought before her eyes the whole picture of\\nher sufferings and tears glistened on the edge of her eyelids.\\n\\n\"I am ill, in truth,\" she said, as she seated herself, feebly and\\nwearily, in the chair Raymon offered her; \"I feel that I am very ill,\\nand, in your presence, monsieur, I have the right to complain.\"\\n\\nRaymon had not hoped to progress so fast. He seized the opportunity by\\nthe hair, as the saying is, and, taking possession of a hand which felt\\ncold and dry in his, he replied:\\n\\n\"Indiana! do not say that; do not say that I am the cause of your\\nillness, for you make me mad with grief and joy.\"\\n\\n\"And joy!\" she repeated, fixing upon him her great blue eyes overflowing\\nwith melancholy and amazement.\\n\\n\"I should have said hope; for, if I have caused you unhappiness, madame,\\nI can perhaps bring it to an end. Say a word,\" he added, kneeling beside\\nher on a cushion that had fallen from the divan, \"ask me for my blood,\\nmy life!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! hush!\" said Indiana bitterly, withdrawing her hand; \"you made a\\nshameful misuse of promises before; try to repair the evil you have\\ndone!\"\\n\\n\"I intend to do it; I will do it!\" he cried, trying to take her hand\\nagain.\\n\\n\"It is too late,\" she said. \"Give me back my companion, my sister; give\\nme back Noun, my only friend!\"\\n\\nA cold shiver ran through Raymon\\'s veins. This time he had no need to\\nencourage her emotion; there are emotions which awake unbidden, mighty\\nand terrible, without the aid of art.\\n\\n\"She knows all,\" he thought, \"and she has judged me.\"\\n\\nNothing could be more humiliating to him than to be reproached for his\\ncrime by the woman who had been his innocent accomplice; nothing more\\nbitter than to see Noun\\'s rival lamenting her death.\\n\\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Indiana, raising her face, down which the tears\\nwere streaming, \"you were the cause--\"\\n\\nBut she paused when she observed Raymon\\'s pallor. It must have been most\\nalarming, for he had never suffered so keenly.\\n\\nThereupon all the kindness of her heart and all the involuntary emotion\\nwhich he aroused in her resumed their sway over Madame Delmare.\\n\\n\"Forgive me!\" she said in dismay; \"I hurt you terribly; I have suffered\\nso myself! Sit down and let us talk of something else.\"\\n\\nThis sudden manifestation of her sweet and generous nature rendered\\nRaymon\\'s emotion deeper than ever. He sobbed aloud; he put Indiana\\'s\\nhand to his lips and covered it with tears and kisses. It was the first\\ntime that he had been able to weep since Noun\\'s death, and it was\\nIndiana who relieved his breast of that terrible weight.\\n\\n\"Oh! since you, who never knew her, weep for her so freely,\" she said;\\n\"since you regret so bitterly the injury you have done me, I dare not\\nreproach you any more. Let us weep for her together, monsieur, so that,\\nfrom her place in heaven, she may see us and forgive us.\"\\n\\nRaymon\\'s forehead was wet with cold perspiration. If the words _you who\\nnever knew her_ had delivered him from painful anxiety, this appeal to\\nhis victim\\'s memory, in Indiana\\'s innocent mouth, terrified him with a\\nsuperstitious terror. Sorely distressed, he rose and walked feverishly\\nto a window and leaned on the sill to breathe the fresh air. Indiana\\nremained in her chair, silent and deeply moved. She felt a sort of\\nsecret joy on seeing Raymon weep like a child and display the weakness\\nof a woman.\\n\\n\"He is naturally kind,\" she murmured to herself; \"he is fond of me; his\\nheart is warm and generous. He did wrong, but his repentance expiates\\nhis fault, and I ought to have forgiven him sooner.\"\\n\\nShe gazed at him with a softened expression; her confidence in him had\\nreturned. She mistook the remorse of the guilty man for the repentance\\nof love.\\n\\n\"Do not weep any more,\" she said, rising and walking up to him; \"it was\\nI who killed her; I alone am guilty. This remorse will sadden my whole\\nlife. I gave way to an impulse of suspicion and anger; I humiliated her,\\nwounded her to the heart. I vented upon her all my spleen against you;\\nit was you alone who had offended me, and I punished my poor friend for\\nit. I was very hard to her!\"\\n\\n\"And to me,\" said Raymon, suddenly forgetting the past to think only of\\nthe present.\\n\\nMadame Delmare blushed.\\n\\n\"I should not perhaps have reproached you for the cruel loss I sustained\\non that awful night,\" she said; \"but I cannot forget the imprudence of\\nyour conduct toward me. The lack of delicacy in your romantic and\\nculpable project wounded me very deeply. I believed then that you loved\\nme!--and you did not even respect me!\"\\n\\nRaymon recovered his strength, his determination, his love, his hopes;\\nthe sinister presentiment, which had made his blood run cold, vanished\\nlike a nightmare. He awoke once more, young, ardent, overflowing with\\ndesire, with passion, and with hopes for the future.\\n\\n\"I am guilty if you hate me,\" he said, vehemently, throwing himself at\\nher feet; \"but, if you love me, I am not guilty--I never have been. Tell\\nme, Indiana, do you love me?\"\\n\\n\"Do you deserve it?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"If, in order to deserve it,\" said Raymon, \"I must love you to\\nadoration--\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" she said, abandoning her hands to him and fastening upon\\nhim her great eyes, swimming in tears, wherein a sombre flame gleamed at\\nintervals. \"Do you know what it is to love a woman like me? No, you do\\nnot know. You thought that it was merely a matter of gratifying the\\ncaprice of a day. You judged my heart by all the surfeited hearts over\\nwhich you have hitherto exerted your ephemeral domination. You do not\\nknow that I have never loved as yet and that I will not give my\\nuntouched virgin heart in exchange for a ruined, withered heart, my\\nenthusiastic love for a lukewarm love, my whole life for one brief day!\"\\n\\n\"Madame, I love you passionately; my heart too is young and ardent, and,\\nif it is not worthy of yours, no man\\'s heart will ever be. I know how\\nyou must be loved; I have not waited until this day to find out. Do I\\nnot know your life? did I not describe it to you at the ball, the first\\ntime that I ever had the privilege of speaking to you? Did I not read\\nthe whole history of your heart in the first one of your glances that\\never fell upon me? And with what did I fall in love, think you? with\\nyour beauty alone? Ah! that is surely enough to drive an older and less\\npassionate man to frenzy; but for my part, if I adore that gracious and\\ncharming envelope, it is because it encloses a pure and divine soul, it\\nis because a celestial fire quickens it, and because I see in you not a\\nwoman simply, but an angel.\"\\n\\n\"I know that you possess the art of praising; but do not hope to move my\\nvanity. I have no need of homage, but of affection. I must be loved\\nwithout a rival, without reserve and forever; you must be ready to\\nsacrifice everything to me, fortune, reputation, duty, business,\\nprinciples, family--everything, monsieur, because I shall place the same\\nabsolute devotion in my scale, and I wish them to balance. You see that\\nyou cannot love me like that!\"\\n\\nIt was not the first time that Raymon had seen a woman take love\\nseriously, although such cases are rare, luckily for society; but he\\nknew that promises of love do not bind the honor, again luckily for\\nsociety. Sometimes too the women who had demanded from him these solemn\\npledges had been the first to break them. He did not take fright\\ntherefore at Madame Delmare\\'s demands, or rather he gave no thought\\neither to the past or the future. He was borne along by the irresistible\\nfascination of that frail, passionate woman, so weak in body, so\\nresolute in heart and mind. She was so beautiful, so animated, so\\nimposing as she dictated her laws to him, that he remained as if\\nfascinated at her knees.\\n\\n\"I swear,\" he said, \"that I will be yours body and soul; I devote my\\nlife, I consecrate my blood to you, I place my will at your service;\\ntake everything, do as you will with my fortune, my honor, my\\nconscience, my thoughts, my whole being.\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Indiana hastily, \"here is my cousin.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke the phlegmatic Sir Ralph Brown entered the room with his\\nusual tranquil air, expressing great surprise and pleasure to see his\\ncousin, whom he had not hoped to see. Then he asked permission to kiss\\nher by way of manifesting his gratitude, and, leaning over her with\\nmethodical moderation, he kissed her on the lips, according to the\\ncustom among children in his country.\\n\\nRaymon turned pale with anger and Ralph had no sooner left the room to\\ngive some order, than he went to Indiana and tried to remove all trace\\nof that impertinent kiss. But Madame Delmare calmly pushed him away.\\n\\n\"Remember,\" she said, \"that you owe much reparation if you wish me to\\nbelieve in you.\"\\n\\nRaymon did not understand the delicacy of this rebuff; he saw in it\\nnothing but a rebuff and he was angry with Sir Ralph. Shortly after he\\nnoticed that, when Sir Ralph spoke to Indiana in an undertone, he used\\nthe more familiar form of address, and he was on the verge of mistaking\\nthe reserve which custom imposed upon Sir Ralph at other times, for the\\nprecaution of a favored lover. But he blushed for his insulting\\nsuspicions as soon as he met the young woman\\'s pure glance.\\n\\nThat evening Raymon displayed his intellectual powers. There was a large\\ncompany and people listened to him; he could not escape the prominence\\nwhich his talents gave him. He talked, and if Indiana had been vain she\\nwould have had her first taste of happiness in listening to him. But on\\nthe contrary her simple, straightforward mind took fright at Raymon\\'s\\nsuperiority; she struggled against the magic power which he exerted over\\nall about him, a sort of magnetic influence which heaven, or hell,\\naccords to certain men--a partial and ephemeral royalty, so real that no\\nmediocre mind can escape its ascendancy, so fleeting that no trace of it\\nremains after them, and that when they die we are amazed at the\\nsensation they made during their lives.\\n\\nThere were many times when Indiana was fascinated by such a brilliant\\ndisplay; but she at once said to herself sadly that she was eager for\\nhappiness, not for glory. She asked herself in dismay if this man, for\\nwhom life had so many different aspects, so many absorbing interests,\\ncould devote his whole mind to her, sacrifice all his ambitions to her.\\nAnd while he defended step by step, with such courage and skill, such\\nardor and self-possession, doctrines purely speculative and interests\\nentirely foreign to their love, she was terrified to see that she was of\\nso little account in his life while he was everything in hers. She said\\nto herself in terror that she was to him a three days\\' fancy and that he\\nhad been to her the dream of a whole life.\\n\\nWhen he offered her his arm as they were leaving the salon, he whispered\\na few words of love in her ear; but she answered sadly:\\n\\n\"You have a great mind!\"\\n\\nRaymon understood the reproof and passed the whole of the following day\\nat Madame Delmare\\'s feet. The other guests, being engrossed by their\\nhunting, left them entirely to themselves.\\n\\nRaymon was eloquent; Indiana had such a craving to believe, that half of\\nhis eloquence was wasted. Women of France, you do not know what a creole\\nis; you would undoubtedly have yielded less readily to conviction, for\\nyou are not the ones to be deceived or betrayed!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\n\\nWhen Sir Ralph returned from hunting and as usual felt Madame Delmare\\'s\\npulse, Raymon, who was watching him closely, detected an almost\\nimperceptible expression of surprise and pleasure on his placid\\nfeatures. And then, in obedience to some mysterious secret impulse, the\\ntwo men looked at each other, and Sir Ralph\\'s light eyes, fastened like\\nan owl\\'s upon Raymon\\'s black ones, forced them to look down. During the\\nrest of the day the baronet\\'s manner toward Madame Delmare, beneath his\\napparent imperturbability, was keenly observant, indicative of something\\nwhich might be called interest or solicitude if his face had been\\ncapable of reflecting a decided sentiment. But Raymon exerted himself in\\nvain to discover if fear or hope were uppermost in his thoughts; Ralph\\nwas impenetrable.\\n\\nSuddenly, as he stood a few steps behind Madame Delmare\\'s chair, he\\nheard her cousin say to her in an undertone:\\n\\n\"You would do well, cousin, to go out in the saddle to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I have no horse just now, as you know,\" she said.\\n\\n\"We will find one for you. Will you hunt with us?\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare resorted to various pretexts to escape. Raymon understood\\nthat she preferred to remain with him, but he thought at the same time\\nthat her cousin seemed to display extraordinary persistence in\\npreventing her from doing so. So he left the persons with whom he was\\ntalking, walked up to her and joined Sir Ralph in urging her to go. He\\nhad a feeling of bitter resentment against this importunate chaperon,\\nand determined to tire out his watchfulness.\\n\\n\"If you will agree to follow the hunt,\" he said to Indiana, \"you will\\nembolden me to follow your example, madame. I care little for hunting;\\nbut to have the privilege of being your esquire----\"\\n\\n\"In that case I will go,\" replied Indiana, heedlessly.\\n\\nShe exchanged a meaning glance with Raymon; but, swift as it was, Sir\\nRalph caught it on the wing, and Raymon was unable, during the rest of\\nthe evening, to glance at her or address her without encountering\\nMonsieur Brown\\'s eyes or ears. A feeling of aversion, almost of\\njealousy, arose in his heart. By what right did this cousin, this friend\\nof the family, assume to act as a school-master with the woman whom he\\nloved! He swore that Sir Ralph should repent, and he sought an\\nopportunity to insult him without compromising Madame Delmare; but that\\nwas impossible. Sir Ralph did the honors of his establishment with a\\ncold and dignified courtesy which offered no handle for an epigram or a\\ncontradiction.\\n\\nThe next morning, before the rising-bell had rung, Raymon was surprised\\nto see his host\\'s solemn face enter his room. There was something even\\nstiffer than usual in his manner, and Raymon felt his heart beat fast\\nwith longing and impatience at the prospect of a challenge. But he came\\nsimply to talk about a horse which Raymon had brought to Bellerive and\\nhad expressed a desire to sell. The bargain was concluded in five\\nminutes; Sir Ralph made no objection to the price but produced a\\n_rouleau_ of gold from his pocket and counted down the amount on the\\nmantel with a coolness of manner that was altogether extraordinary, not\\ndeigning to pay any heed to Raymon\\'s remonstrances concerning such\\nscrupulous promptness. As he was leaving the room, he turned back to\\nsay:\\n\\n\"Monsieur, the horse belongs to me from this morning!\"\\n\\nAt that Raymon fancied that he could detect a purpose to prevent him\\nfrom hunting, and he observed dryly that he did not propose to follow\\nthe hunt on foot.\\n\\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Sir Ralph, with a slight trace of affectation, \"I am\\ntoo well versed in the laws of hospitality.\"\\n\\nAnd he withdrew.\\n\\nOn going down into the courtyard Raymon saw Madame Delmare in her\\nriding-habit, playing merrily with Ophelia, who was tearing her\\nhandkerchief. Her cheeks had taken on a faint rosy tinge, her eyes shone\\nwith a brilliancy that had long been absent from them. She had already\\nrecovered her beauty; her curly black hair escaped from beneath her\\nlittle hat, in which she was charming; and the cloth habit buttoned to\\nthe chin outlined her slender, graceful figure. The principal charm of\\nthe creoles, to my mind, consists in the fact that the excessive\\ndelicacy of their features and their proportions enables them to retain\\nfor a long while the daintiness of childhood. Indiana, in her gay and\\nlaughing mood, seemed to be no more than fourteen.\\n\\nRaymon, impressed by her charms, felt a thrill of triumph and paid her\\nthe least insipid compliment he could invent upon her beauty.\\n\\n\"You were anxious about my health,\" she said to him in an undertone; \"do\\nyou not see that I long to live?\" He could not reply otherwise than by a\\nhappy, grateful glance. Sir Ralph himself brought his cousin her horse;\\nRaymon recognized the one he had just sold.\\n\\n\"What!\" said Madame Delmare in amazement, for she had seen him trying\\nthe animal the day before in the courtyard, \"is Monsieur de Ramière so\\npolite as to lend me his horse?\"\\n\\n\"Did you not admire the creature\\'s beauty and docility yesterday?\" said\\nSir Ralph; \"he is yours from this moment. I am sorry, my dear, that I\\ncouldn\\'t have given him to you sooner.\"\\n\\n\"You are growing facetious, cousin,\" said Madame Delmare; \"I do not\\nunderstand this joke at all. Whom am I to thank--Monsieur de Ramière,\\nwho consents to lend me his horse, or you, who perhaps asked him for\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"You must thank your cousin,\" said Monsieur Delmare, \"who bought this\\nhorse for you and makes you a present of him.\"\\n\\n\"Is it really true, my dear Ralph?\" said Madame Delmare, patting the\\npretty creature with the delight of a girl at receiving her first\\njewels.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t we agree that I should give you a horse in exchange for the\\npiece of embroidery you are doing for me? Come, mount him, have no fear.\\nI have studied his disposition, and I tried him only this morning.\"\\n\\nIndiana threw her arms around Sir Ralph\\'s neck, then leaped upon\\nRaymon\\'s horse and fearlessly made him prance.\\n\\nThis whole domestic scene took place in a corner of the courtyard before\\nRaymon\\'s eyes. He was conscious of a paroxysm of violent anger when the\\nsimple and trustful affection of those two displayed itself before him;\\npassionately in love as he was and with less than a whole day in which\\nto have Indiana to himself.\\n\\n\"How happy I am!\" she said, calling him to her side on the avenue. \"It\\nseems my dear Ralph divined what gift would be most precious to me. And\\naren\\'t you happy too, Raymon, to see the horse you have ridden pass into\\nmy hands? Oh! how I will love him and care for him! What do you call\\nhim? Tell me; for I prefer not to take away the name you gave him.\"\\n\\n\"If there is a happy man here,\" rejoined Raymon, \"it should be your\\ncousin, who gives you presents and whom you kiss so heartily.\"\\n\\n\"Are you really jealous of our friendship and of those loud smacks?\" she\\nsaid with a laugh.\\n\\n\"Jealous? perhaps so, Indiana; I am not sure. But when that red-cheeked\\nyoung cousin puts his lips to yours, when he takes you in his arms to\\nseat you on the horse that he _gives_ you and I _sell_ you, I confess\\nthat I suffer. No, madame, I am not happy to see you the mistress of the\\nhorse I loved. I can understand that one might be happy in giving him to\\nyou; but to play the tradesman in order to provide another with the\\nmeans of making himself agreeable to you, is a very cleverly managed\\nhumiliation on Sir Ralph\\'s part. If I did not believe that all this\\ncunning was quite involuntary, I would like to be revenged on him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! fie! this jealousy is not becoming to you! How can our commonplace\\nintimacy arouse any feeling in you, in you who should be, so far as I am\\nconcerned, outside of the common life of mankind and should create for\\nme a world of enchantment--in you of all men! I am displeased with you\\nalready, Raymon; I perceive that there is something like wounded\\nself-esteem in this angry feeling displayed toward this poor cousin. It\\nseems to me that you are more jealous of the lukewarm preference which I\\ndisplay for him in public than of the exclusive affection which I might\\nsecretly entertain for another.\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, forgive me, Indiana, I am wrong! I am not worthy of you,\\nangel of goodness and gentleness! but I confess that I have suffered\\ncruelly because of the right that man has seemed to assume.\"\\n\\n\"He assume rights, Raymon! Do you not know what sacred gratitude binds\\nus to him? do you not know that his mother was my mother\\'s sister? that\\nwe were born in the same valley; that in our early years he was my\\nprotector; that he was my mainstay, my only teacher, my only companion\\nat Ile Bourbon; that he has followed me everywhere; that he left the\\ncountry which I left, to come and live where I lived; in a word, that he\\nis the only being who loves me and who takes any interest in my life?\"\\n\\n\"Curse him! all that you tell me, Indiana, inflames the wound. So he\\nloves you very dearly, does this Englishman, eh? Do you know how I love\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! let us not compare the two. If an attachment of the same nature\\nmade you rivals, I should owe the preference to the one of longer\\nstanding. But have no fear, Raymon, that I shall ever ask you to love me\\nas Ralph loves me.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me about the man, I beg you; for who can penetrate his stone\\nmask?\"\\n\\n\"Must I do the honors for my cousin?\" she said with a smile. \"I confess\\nthat I do not altogether like the idea of describing him; I love him so\\ndearly that I would like to flatter him; as he is, I am afraid that you\\nwill not find him a very noble figure. Do try to help me; come, how does\\nhe seem to you?\"\\n\\n\"His face--forgive me if I wound you--indicates absolute nonentity; but\\nthere are signs of good sense and education in his conversation when he\\ndeigns to speak; but he speaks so hesitatingly, so coldly, that no one\\nprofits by his knowledge, his delivery is so depressing and tiresome.\\nAnd then there is something commonplace and dull in his thoughts which\\nis not redeemed by measured purity of expression. I think that his is a\\nmind imbued with all the ideas that have been suggested to him, but too\\napathetic and too mediocre to have any of his own. He is just the sort\\nof man that one must be to be looked upon in society as a serious-minded\\nperson. His gravity forms three-fourths of his merit, his indifference\\nthe rest.\"\\n\\n\"There is some truth in your portrait,\" said Indiana, \"but there is\\nprejudice too. You boldly solve doubts which I should not dare to solve,\\nalthough I have known Ralph ever since I was born. It is true that his\\ngreat defect consists in looking frequently through the eyes of others;\\nbut that is not the fault of his mind but of his education. You think\\nthat, without education, he would have been an absolute nonentity; I\\nthink that he would have been less so than he is. I must tell you one\\nfact in his life which will help to explain his character. He was\\nunfortunate to have a brother whom his parents openly preferred to him;\\nthis brother had all the brilliant qualities that he lacks. He learned\\neasily, he had a taste for all the arts, he fairly sparkled with wit;\\nhis face, while less regular than Ralph\\'s, was more expressive. He was\\naffectionate, zealous, active, in a word, he was lovable. Ralph, on the\\ncontrary, was awkward, melancholy, undemonstrative; he loved solitude,\\nlearned slowly and did not make a display of what little knowledge he\\npossessed. When his parents saw how different he was from his older\\nbrother, they maltreated him; they did worse than that: they humiliated\\nhim. Thereupon, child as he was, his character became gloomy and pensive\\nand an unconquerable timidity paralyzed all his faculties. They had\\nsucceeded in inspiring in him self-aversion and self-contempt; he became\\ndiscouraged with life, and, at the age of fifteen, he was attacked by\\nthe spleen, a malady that is wholly physical under the foggy sky of\\nEngland, wholly mental under the revivifying sky of Ile Bourbon. He has\\noften told me that one day he left the house with a determination to\\nthrow himself into the sea; but as he sat on the shore collecting his\\nthoughts, as he was on the point of carrying out his plan, he saw me\\ncoming toward him in the arms of the negress who had been my nurse. I\\nwas then five years old. I was pretty, they say, and I manifested a\\npredilection for my taciturn cousin which nobody shared. To be sure, he\\nwas attentive and kind to me in a way I was not accustomed to in my\\nfather\\'s house. As we were both unhappy, we understood each other even\\nthen. He taught me his father\\'s language, and I lisped mine to him. This\\nblending of Spanish and English may be said to express Ralph\\'s\\ncharacter. When I threw my arms around his neck, I saw that he was\\nweeping, and, without knowing why, I began to weep too. Thereupon he\\npressed me to his heart and, so he told me afterward, made a vow to live\\nfor me, a neglected if not hated child, to whom his friendship would at\\nall events be a kindness and his life of some benefit. Thus I was the\\nfirst and only tie in his sad life. After that day we were hardly ever\\napart; we passed our days leading a free and healthy life in the\\nsolitude of the mountains. But perhaps these tales of our childhood bore\\nyou, and you would prefer to join the hunt and have a gallop.\"\\n\\n\"Foolish girl,\" said Raymon, seizing the bridle of Madame Delmare\\'s\\nhorse.\\n\\n\"Very well, I will go on,\" said she. \"Edmond Brown, Ralph\\'s older\\nbrother, died at the age of twenty; his mother also died of grief, and\\nhis father was inconsolable. Ralph would have been glad to mitigate his\\nsorrow, but the coldness with which Monsieur Brown greeted his first\\nattempts increased his natural timidity. He passed whole hours in\\nmelancholy silence beside that heartbroken old man, not daring to\\nproffer a word or a caress, he was so afraid that his consolation would\\nseem misplaced or trivial. His father accused him of lack of feeling,\\nand Edmond\\'s death left Ralph more wretched and more misunderstood than\\never. I was his only consolation.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot pity him, whatever you may do,\" Raymon interrupted; \"but there\\nis one thing in his life and yours that I cannot understand: it is that\\nyou never married.\"\\n\\n\"I can give you a very good reason for that,\" she replied. \"When I\\nreached a marriageable age, Ralph, who was ten years older than I--an\\nenormous difference in our climate, where the childhood of girls is so\\nbrief--Ralph, I say, was already married.\"\\n\\n\"Is Sir Ralph a widower? I never heard anyone mention his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Never mention her to him. She was young and rich and lovely, but she\\nhad been in love with Edmond--she had been betrothed to him; and when,\\nin order to serve family interests and family sentiment, she was made to\\nmarry Ralph, she did not so much as try to conceal her aversion for him.\\nHe was obliged to go to England with her, and when he returned to Ile\\nBourbon after his wife\\'s death, I was married to Monsieur Delmare and\\njust about to start for Europe. Ralph tried to live alone, but solitude\\naggravated his misery. Although he has never mentioned Mistress Ralph\\nBrown to me, I have every reason to believe that he was even more\\nunhappy in his married life than he had been in his father\\'s house, and\\nthat his natural melancholy was increased by recent and painful\\nmemories. He was attacked with the spleen again; whereupon he sold his\\ncoffee plantation and came to France to settle down. His manner of\\nintroducing himself to my husband was original, and would have made me\\nlaugh if my good Ralph\\'s attachment had not touched me deeply.\\n\\'Monsieur,\\' he said, \\'I love your wife; it was I who brought her up; I\\nlook upon her as my sister and even more as my daughter. She is my only\\nremaining relative and the only person to whom I am attached. Allow me\\nto establish myself near you and let us three pass our lives together.\\nThey say that you are a little jealous of your wife, but they say also\\nthat you are a man of honor and uprightness. When I tell you that I have\\nnever had any other than brotherly love for her, and that I shall never\\nhave, you can regard me with as little anxiety as if I were really your\\nbrother-in-law. Isn\\'t it so, monsieur?\\' Monsieur Delmare, who is very\\nproud of his reputation for soldierly frankness, greeted this outspoken\\ndeclaration with a sort of ostentatious confidence. But several months\\nof careful watching were necessary before that confidence became as\\ngenuine as he boasted that it was. Now it is as impregnable as Ralph\\'s\\nsteadfast and pacific heart.\"\\n\\n\"Are you perfectly sure, Indiana,\" said Raymon, \"that Sir Ralph is not\\ndeceiving himself the least bit in the world when he swears that he\\nnever loved you?\"\\n\\n\"I was twelve years old when he left Ile Bourbon to go with his wife to\\nEngland; I was sixteen when he returned to find me married, and he\\nmanifested more joy than sorrow. Now, Ralph is really an old man.\"\\n\\n\"At twenty-nine?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh at what I say. His face is young, but his heart is worn out\\nby suffering, and he no longer loves anybody, in order to avoid\\nsuffering.\"\\n\\n\"Not even you?\"\\n\\n\"Not even me. His friendship is simply a matter of habit; it was\\ngenerous in the old days when he took upon himself to protect and\\neducate my childhood, and then I loved him as he loves me to-day because\\nof the need I had of him. To-day my whole heart is bent upon paying my\\ndebt to him, and my life is passed in trying to beautify and enliven\\nhis. But, when I was a child, I loved him with the instinct rather than\\nwith the heart, and he, now that he is a man, loves me less with the\\nheart than with the instinct. I am necessary to him because I am almost\\nalone in loving him; and to-day, as Monsieur Delmare manifests some\\nattachment to him, he is almost as fond of him as of me. His protection,\\nformerly so fearless in face of my father\\'s despotism, has become\\nlukewarm and cautious in face of my husband\\'s. He never reproaches\\nhimself because I suffer, provided that I am near him. He does not ask\\nhimself if I am unhappy; it is enough for him to see that I am alive. He\\ndoes not choose to lend me a support, which, while it would make my lot\\nless cruel, would disturb his serenity by making trouble between him and\\nMonsieur Delmare. By dint of hearing himself say again and again that\\nhis heart is dry, he has persuaded himself that it is true, and his\\nheart has withered in the inaction in which he has allowed it to fall\\nasleep from distrust. He is a man whom the affection of another person\\nmight have developed; but it was withdrawn from him and he shrivelled\\nup. Now he asserts that happiness consists in repose, pleasure, in the\\ncomforts of life. He asks no questions about cares that he has not. I\\nmust say the word: Ralph is selfish.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, so much the better,\" said Raymon; \"I am no longer afraid of\\nhim; indeed I will love him if you wish.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, love him, Raymon,\" she replied; \"he will appreciate it; and, so\\nfar as we are concerned, let us never trouble ourselves to explain why\\npeople love us, but how they love us. Happy the man who can be loved, no\\nmatter for what reason!\"\\n\\n\"What you say, Indiana,\" replied Raymon, grasping her slender, willowy\\nform, \"is the lament of a sad and solitary heart; but, in my case, I\\nwant you to know both why and how, especially why.\"\\n\\n\"To give me happiness, is it not?\" she said, with a sad but passionate\\nglance.\\n\\n\"To give you my life,\" said Raymon, brushing Indiana\\'s floating hair\\nwith his lips.\\n\\nA blast upon the horn near by warned them to be on their guard; it was\\nSir Ralph, who saw them or did not see them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\n\\nRaymon was amazed at what seemed to take place in Indiana\\'s being as\\nsoon as the hounds were away. Her eyes gleamed, her cheeks flushed, the\\ndilation of her nostrils betrayed an indefinable thrill of fear or\\npleasure, and suddenly, driving her spurs into her horse\\'s side, she\\nleft him and galloped after Ralph. Raymon did not know that hunting was\\nthe only passion that Ralph and Indiana had in common. Nor did he\\nsuspect that in that frail and apparently timid woman there abode a more\\nthan masculine courage, that sort of delirious intrepidity which\\nsometimes manifests itself like a nervous paroxysm in the feeblest\\ncreatures. Women rarely have the physical courage which consists in\\noffering the resistance of inertia to pain or danger; but they often\\nhave the moral courage which attains its climax in peril or suffering.\\nIndiana\\'s delicate fibres delighted above all things in the tumult, the\\nrapid movement and the excitement of the chase, that miniature image of\\nwar with its fatigues, its stratagems, its calculations, its hazards and\\nits battles. Her dull, ennui-laden life needed this excitement; at such\\ntimes she seemed to wake from a lethargy and to expend in one day all\\nthe energy that she had left to ferment uselessly in her blood for a\\nwhole year.\\n\\nRaymon was terrified to see her ride away so fast, abandoning herself\\nfearlessly to the impetuous spirit of a horse that she hardly knew,\\nrushing him through the thickets, avoiding with amazing skill the\\nbranches that lashed at her face as they sprang back, leaping ditches\\nwithout hesitation, venturing confidently on clayey, slippery ground,\\nheedless of the risk of breaking her slender limbs, but eager to be\\nfirst on the smoking scent of the boar. So much determination alarmed\\nhim and nearly disgusted him with Madame Delmare. Men, especially\\nlovers, are addicted to the innocent fatuity of preferring to protect\\nweakness rather than to admire courage in womankind. Shall I confess it?\\nRaymon was terrified at the promise of high spirit and tenacity in love\\nwhich such intrepidity seemed to afford. It was not like the resignation\\nof poor Noun, who preferred to drown herself rather than to contend\\nagainst her misfortunes.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration 03: _THE BOAR HUNT_\\n_Raymon was terrified to see her ride away so\\nfast, abandoning herself fearlessly to the impetuous\\nspirit of a horse that she hardly knew, rushing him\\nthrough the thickets, avoiding with amazing skill\\nthe branches that lashed at her face as they sprang\\nback, leaping ditches without hesitation, venturing\\nconfidently on clayey, slippery ground, heedless of the\\nrisk of breaking her slender limbs, but eager to be\\nfirst on the smoking scent of the boar._]\\n\\n\\n\"If there\\'s as much vigor and excitement in her tenderness as there is\\nin her diversions,\" he thought; \"if her will clings to me, fierce and\\npalpitating, as her caprice clings to that boar\\'s quarters, why society\\nwill impose no fetters on her, the law will have no force; my destiny\\nwill have to succumb and I shall have to sacrifice my future to her\\npresent.\"\\n\\nCries of terror and distress, among which he could distinguish Madame\\nDelmare\\'s voice, roused Raymon from these reflections. He anxiously\\nurged his horse forward and was soon overtaken by Ralph, who asked him\\nif he had heard the outcries.\\n\\nAt that moment several terrified whippers-in rode up to them, crying out\\nconfusedly that the boar had charged and overthrown Madame Delmare.\\nOther huntsmen, in still greater dismay, appeared, calling for Sir\\nRalph, whose surgical skill was required by the injured person.\\n\\n\"It\\'s of no use,\" said a late arrival. \"There is no hope, your help will\\nbe too late.\"\\n\\nIn that moment of horror, Raymon\\'s eyes fell upon the pale, gloomy\\nfeatures of Monsieur Brown. He did not cry out, he did not foam at the\\nmouth, he did not wring his hands; he simply took out his hunting-knife\\nand with a _sang-froid_ truly English was preparing to cut his own\\nthroat, when Raymon snatched the weapon from him and hurried him in the\\ndirection from which the cries came.\\n\\nRalph felt as if he were waking from a dream when he saw Madame Delmare\\nrush to meet him and urge him forward to the assistance of her husband,\\nwho lay on the ground, apparently lifeless. Sir Ralph made haste to\\nbleed him; for he had speedily satisfied himself that he was not dead;\\nbut his leg was broken and he was taken to the château.\\n\\nAs for Madame Delmare, in the confusion her name had been substituted by\\naccident for that of her husband, or perhaps Ralph and Raymon had\\nerroneously thought that they heard the name in which they were most\\ninterested.\\n\\nIndiana was uninjured, but her fright and consternation had almost taken\\naway her power of locomotion. Raymon supported her in his arms and was\\nreconciled to her womanly heart when he saw how deeply affected she was\\nby the misfortune of a husband whom she had much to forgive before\\npitying him.\\n\\nSir Ralph had already recovered his accustomed tranquillity; but an\\nextraordinary pallor revealed the violent shock he had experienced; he\\nhad nearly lost one of the two human beings whom he loved.\\n\\nRaymon, who alone, in that moment of confusion and excitement, had\\nretained sufficient presence of mind to understand what he saw, had been\\nable to judge of Ralph\\'s affection for his cousin, and how little it was\\nbalanced by his feeling for the colonel. This observation, which\\npositively contradicted Indiana\\'s opinion, did not depart from Raymon\\'s\\nmemory as it did from that of the other witnesses of the scene.\\n\\nHowever Raymon never mentioned to Madame Delmare the attempted suicide\\nof which he had been a witness. In this ungenerous reserve there was a\\nsuggestion of selfishness and bad temper which you will forgive perhaps\\nin view of the amorous jealousy which was responsible for it.\\n\\nAfter six weeks the colonel was with much difficulty removed to Lagny;\\nbut it was more than six months thereafter before he could walk; for\\nbefore the fractured femur was fairly reduced he had an acute attack of\\nrheumatism in the injured leg, which condemned him to excruciating pain\\nand absolute immobility. His wife lavished the most loving attentions\\nupon him; she never left his bedside and endured without a complaint his\\nbitter fault-finding humor, his soldier-like testiness and his invalid\\'s\\ninjustice.\\n\\nDespite the ennui of such a depressing life, her health became robust\\nand flourishing once more and happiness took up its abode in her heart.\\nRaymon loved her, he really loved her. He came every day; he was\\ndiscouraged by no difficulty in the way of seeing her, he bore with the\\ninfirmities of her husband, her cousin\\'s coldness, the constraint of\\ntheir interviews. A glance from him filled Indiana\\'s heart with joy for\\na whole day. She no longer thought of complaining of life; her heart was\\nfull, her youthful nature had ample employment, her moral force had\\nsomething to feed upon.\\n\\nThe colonel gradually came to feel very friendly to Raymon. He was\\nsimple enough to believe that his neighbor\\'s assiduity in calling upon\\nhim was a proof of the interest he took in his health. Madame de\\nRamière also came occasionally, to sanction the liaison by her\\npresence, and Indiana became warmly and passionately attached to\\nRaymon\\'s mother. At last the wife\\'s lover became the husband\\'s friend.\\n\\nAs a result of being thus constantly thrown together, Raymon and Ralph\\nperforce became intimate in a certain sense; they called each other \"my\\ndear fellow,\" they shook hands morning and night. If either of them\\ndesired to ask a slight favor of the other, the regular form was this:\\n\"I count upon your friendship,\" etc. And when they spoke of each other\\nthey said: \"He is a friend of mine.\"\\n\\nBut, although they were both as frank and outspoken as a man can be in\\nthe world, they were not at all fond of each other. They differed\\nessentially in their opinions on every subject; they had no likes or\\ndislikes in common; and, although they both loved Madame Delmare, they\\nloved her in such a different way that that sentiment divided them\\ninstead of bringing them together. They found a singular pleasure in\\ncontradicting each other and in disturbing each other\\'s equanimity as\\nmuch as possible by reproaches which were none the less sharp and bitter\\nbecause they took the form of generalities.\\n\\nTheir principal and most frequent controversies began with politics and\\nended with morals. It was in the evening, when they were all assembled\\naround Monsieur Delmare\\'s easy-chair, that discussions arose on the most\\ntrivial pretexts. They always maintained the external courtesy which\\nphilosophy imposed on the one and social custom on the other: but they\\nsometimes said to each other, under the thin veil of allusions, some\\nvery harsh things, which amused the colonel; for he was naturally\\nbellicose and quarrelsome and loved disputes in default of battles.\\n\\nFor my part, I believe that a man\\'s political opinion is the whole man.\\nTell me what your heart and your head are and I will tell you your\\npolitical opinions. In whatever rank or political party chance may have\\nplaced us at our birth, our character prevails sooner or later over the\\nprejudice or artificial beliefs of education. You will call that a very\\nsweeping statement perhaps; but how could I persuade myself to augur\\nwell of a mind that clings to certain theories which a generous spirit\\nrejects? Show me a man who maintains the usefulness of capital\\npunishment, and, however conscientious and enlightened he may be, I defy\\nyou ever to establish any sympathetic connection between him and me. If\\nsuch a man attempts to instruct me as to facts which I do not know, he\\nwill never succeed; for it will not be in my power to give him my\\nconfidence.\\n\\nRalph and Raymon differed on all points, and, yet, before they knew each\\nother, they had no clearly defined opinions. But, as soon as they were\\nat odds, each of them maintained the contrary of what the other\\nadvanced, and in that way they would form for themselves an absolute,\\nunassailable conviction. Raymon was on all occasions the champion of\\nexisting society, Ralph attacked its structure at every point.\\n\\nThe explanation was simple: Raymon was happy and treated with the utmost\\nconsideration, Ralph had known nothing of life but its evils and its\\nbitterness; one found everything very satisfactory, the other was\\ndissatisfied with everything. Men and things had maltreated Ralph and\\nheaped benefits upon Raymon; and, like two children, they referred\\neverything to themselves, setting themselves up as a court of last\\nresort in regard to the great questions of social order, although they\\nwere equally incompetent.\\n\\nThus Ralph always upheld his visionary scheme of a republic from which\\nhe proposed to exclude all abuses, all prejudices, all injustice; a\\nscheme founded entirely upon the hope of a new race of men. Raymon\\nupheld his doctrine of an hereditary monarchy, preferring, he said, to\\nendure abuses, prejudice and injustice, to seeing scaffolds erected and\\ninnocent blood shed.\\n\\nThe colonel was almost always on Ralph\\'s side at the beginning of the\\ndiscussion. He hated the Bourbons and imparted to all his opinions all\\nthe animosity of his sentiments. But soon Raymon would adroitly bring\\nhim over to his side by proving to him that the monarchy was in\\nprinciple much nearer the Empire than the Republic. Ralph was so lacking\\nin the power of persuasion, he was so sincere, so bungling, the poor\\nbaronet! his frankness was so unpolished, his logic so dull, his\\nprinciples so rigid! He spared no one, he softened no harsh truth.\\n\\n\"_Parbleu!_\" he would say to the colonel, when that worthy cursed\\nEngland\\'s intervention, \"what in heaven\\'s name have you, a man of some\\ncommon sense and reasoning power, I suppose, to complain of because a\\nwhole nation fought fairly against you?\"\\n\\n\"Fairly?\" Delmare would repeat the word, grinding his teeth together and\\nbrandishing his crutch.\\n\\n\"Let us leave political questions to be decided by the powers\\nconcerned,\" Sir Ralph would say, \"as we have adopted a form of\\ngovernment which forbids us to discuss our interests ourselves. If a\\nnation is responsible for the faults of its legislature, what one can\\nyou find that is guiltier than yours?\"\\n\\n\"And so I say, monsieur, shame upon France, which abandoned Napoléon\\nand submitted to a king proclaimed by the bayonets of foreigners!\" the\\ncolonel would exclaim.\\n\\n\"For my part, I do not say shame upon France,\" Sir Ralph would rejoin,\\n\"but woe to her! I pity her because she was so weak and so diseased, on\\nthe day she was purged of her tyrant, that she was compelled to accept\\nyour rag of a constitutional Charter, a mere shred of liberty which you\\nare beginning to respect now that you must throw it aside and conquer\\nyour liberty over again.\"\\n\\nThereupon Raymon would pick up the gauntlet that Sir Ralph threw down. A\\nknight of the Charter, he chose to be a knight of liberty as well, and\\nhe proved to Ralph with marvelous skill that one was the expression of\\nthe other; that, if he shattered the Charter he overturned his own idol.\\nIn vain would the baronet struggle in the unsound arguments in which\\nMonsieur de Ramière entangled him; with admirable force he would argue\\nthat a greater extension of the suffrage would infallibly lead to the\\nexcesses of \\'93, and that the nation was not yet ripe for liberty, which\\nis not the same as license. And when Sir Ralph declared that it was\\nabsurd to attempt to confine a constitution within a certain number of\\narticles, that what was sufficient at first would eventually become\\ninsufficient, supporting his argument by the example of the\\nconvalescent, whose needs increased every day, Raymon would reply to all\\nthese commonplaces expressed with difficulty by Monsieur Brown that the\\nCharter was not an immovable circle, that it would stretch with the\\nnecessities of France, attributing to it an elasticity which, he said,\\nwould afford later a means of satisfying the demands of the nation, but\\nwhich in fact satisfied only those of the crown.\\n\\nAs to Delmare, he had not advanced a step since 1815. He was a\\nstationary mortal, as full of prejudices and as obstinate as the\\némigrés at Coblentz, the never-failing subjects of his implacable\\nirony. He was like an old child and had failed utterly to comprehend the\\ngreat drama of the downfall of Napoléon. He had seen naught but the\\nfortune of war in that crisis when the power of public opinion\\ntriumphed. He was forever talking of treason and of selling the country,\\nas if a whole nation could betray a single man, as if France would have\\nallowed herself to be sold by a few generals! He accused the Bourbons of\\ntyranny and sighed for the glorious days of the Empire, when arms were\\nlacking to till the soil and families were without bread. He declaimed\\nagainst Franchet\\'s police and extolled Fouché\\'s. He was still at the\\nday after Waterloo.\\n\\nIt was really a curious thing to listen to the sentimental idiocies of\\nDelmare and Monsieur de Ramière, philanthropic dreamers both, one under\\nthe sword of Napoléon, the other under the sceptre of Saint-Louis;\\nMonsieur Delmare planted at the foot of the Pyramids, Raymon seated\\nunder the monarchic shadow of the oak of Vincennes. Their Utopias, which\\nclashed at first, became reconciled in due time: Raymon limed the\\ncolonel with his chivalrous sentiments; for one concession he exacted\\nten, and he accustomed him little by little to the spectacle of\\ntwenty-five years of victory ascending in a spiral column under the\\nfolds of the white flag. If Ralph had not constantly cast his abrupt,\\nrough observations into the centre of Monsieur de Ramière\\'s flowery\\nrhetoric, he would infallibly have won Delmare over to the throne of\\n1815; but Ralph irritated his self-esteem, and the bungling\\noutspokenness with which the Englishman strove to shake his convictions\\nserved only to anchor him more firmly in his imperialism. Thus all\\nMonsieur de Ramière\\'s efforts were wasted; Ralph trod heavily upon the\\nflowers of his eloquence and the colonel returned with renewed\\nenthusiasm to his tri-color. He swore that he would shake off the dust\\nfrom it some fine day, that he would spit on the lilies and restore the\\nDuc de Reichstadt to the throne of _his fathers_; he would begin anew\\nthe conquest of the world; and he always concluded by lamenting the\\ndisgrace that rested upon France, the rheumatism that glued him to his\\nchair and the ingratitude of the Bourbons to the old moustaches whom the\\nsun of the desert had burned and who had swarmed over the ice-floes of\\nthe Moskowa.\\n\\n\"My poor fellow!\" Ralph would say, \"for heaven\\'s sake be fair; you\\ncomplain because the Restoration did not pay for services rendered the\\nEmpire and because it did reimburse its _émigrés._ Tell me, if\\nNapoléon could come to life again to-morrow in all his power, would you\\nlike it if he should withdraw his favor from you and bestow it on the\\npartisans of legitimacy? Every one for himself and his own; these are\\nbusiness discussions, disputes concerning private interests, which have\\nlittle interest for France, now that you are almost all as incapacitated\\nas the _voltigeurs_ of the emigration, and that, whether gouty, married\\nor sulking, you are all equally useless to her. However, she must\\nsupport you all, and you see who can complain the loudest of her. When\\nthe day of the Republic dawns, she will clear her skirts of all your\\ndemands, and it will be no more than justice.\"\\n\\nThese trivial but self-evident observations offended the colonel like so\\nmany personal affronts; and Ralph who, with all his good sense, did not\\nrealize that the pettiness of spirit of a man whom he esteemed could go\\nso far, fell into the habit of irritating him without mercy.\\n\\nBefore Raymon\\'s arrival there had been a tacit agreement between the two\\nto avoid every subject of controversy in which there might be some\\nclashing and wounding of delicate sensibilities. But Raymon brought into\\ntheir conversation all the subtleties of the language, all the petty\\nartifices of civilization. He taught them that people can say anything\\nto one another, indulge in all sorts of reproaches and shield themselves\\nbehind the pretext of legitimate discussion. He introduced among them\\nthe habit of disputation, then tolerated in the salons, because the\\nvindictive passions of the Hundred Days had finally become appeased, had\\nassumed divers milder shades. But the colonel had retained all the\\nvehemence of his passions, and Ralph made a sad mistake in thinking that\\nit was possible for him to listen to reason. Monsieur Delmare became\\ndaily more sour toward him and drew nearer to Raymon, who, without\\nmaking too extensive concessions, knew how to assume an appearance of\\ngraciousness in order to spare the other\\'s self-esteem.\\n\\nIt is a great imprudence to introduce politics as a pastime in the\\ndomestic circle. If there exist to-day any peaceful and happy families,\\nI advise them to subscribe to no newspaper; not to read a single line of\\nthe budget, to bury themselves in the depth of their country estates as\\nin an oasis, and to draw between themselves and the rest of society a\\nline that none may pass; for, if they allow the echoes of our disputes\\nto meet their ears, it is all over with their union and their repose. It\\nis hard to imagine how much gall and bitterness political differences\\ncause between near kindred. Most of the time they simply afford them an\\nopportunity for reproaching one another for defects of character, mental\\nobliquities and vices of the heart.\\n\\nThey would not dare to call one another knave, imbecile, ambitious\\nvillain or poltroon. They express the same idea by such names as\\n_jesuit, royalist, revolutionist_ and _trimmer._ These are different\\nwords, but the insult is the same, and all the more stinging because\\nthey may pursue and attack one another in this fashion without\\nrestraint, without mercy. There is an end to all mutual toleration of\\nfailings, all charitable spirit, all generous and delicate reserve;\\nnothing is overlooked, everything is attributed to political feeling,\\nand beneath that mask hatred and vengeance are freely exhaled. O ye\\nblessed dwellers in the country, if there still be any country in\\nFrance, shun, shun politics, and read the _Peau d\\'Ane_ by your\\nfiresides! But the contagion is so great that there is no retreat\\nobscure enough, no solitude profound enough to hide and shelter the man\\nwho would find a refuge for his amiable heart from the tempests of our\\ncivil dissensions.\\n\\nIn vain had the little château in Brie defended itself for years\\nagainst this ill-omened invasion; it lost in time its heedlessness, its\\nactive domestic life, its long evenings of silence and meditation. Noisy\\ndisputes awoke its slumbering echoes; bitter and threatening words\\nterrified the faded cherubs who had smiled amid the dust of the hangings\\nfor a hundred years past. The excitements of present-day life found\\ntheir way into that ancient dwelling, and all those old-fashioned\\nsplendors, all those relics of a period of pleasure and frivolity saw\\nwith dismay the advent of an epoch of doubt and declamation, represented\\nby three men who shut themselves up together every day to quarrel from\\nmorning till night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\n\\nDespite these never-ending dissensions, Madame Delmare clung with the\\nconfidence of her years to the hope of a happy future. It was her first\\nhappiness; and her ardent imagination, her rich young heart, were able\\nto supply it with all that it lacked. She was ingenious in creating keen\\nand pure joys for herself--in bestowing upon herself the complement of\\nthe precarious favors of her destiny. Raymon loved her. In truth he did\\nnot lie when he told her that she was the only love of his life; he had\\nnever loved so innocently nor so long. With her he forgot everything but\\nher. The world and politics were blotted out by the thought of her; he\\nenjoyed the domestic life, the being treated like one of the family, as\\nshe treated him. He admired her patience and her strength of will; he\\nwondered at the contrast between her mind and her character; he wondered\\nespecially that, after importing so much solemnity into their first\\ncompact, she was so unexacting, satisfied with such furtive and\\ninfrequent joys, and that she trusted him so blindly and so absolutely.\\nBut love was a novel and generous passion in her heart, and a thousand\\nnoble and delicate sentiments were included in it and gave it a force\\nwhich Raymon could not understand.\\n\\nFor his own part, he was annoyed at first by the constant presence of\\nthe husband or the cousin. He had intended that this love should be like\\nall his previous loves, but Indiana soon compelled him to rise to her\\nlevel. The resignation with which she endured the constant surveillance,\\nthe happy air with which she glanced at him by stealth, her eyes which\\nspoke to him in eloquent though silent language, her sublime smile when\\na sudden allusion in conversation brought their hearts nearer\\ntogether--these soon became keen pleasures which Raymon craved and\\nappreciated, thanks to the refinement of his mind and the culture of\\neducation.\\n\\nWhat a difference between that chaste creature who seemed not to\\ncontemplate the possibility of a _dénoûment_ to her love and all those\\nother women who were intent only upon hastening it while pretending to\\nshun it! When Raymon happened to be alone with her, Indiana\\'s cheeks did\\nnot turn a deeper red, nor did she avert her eyes in confusion. No, her\\ntranquil, limpid eyes were always fixed upon him in ecstasy; an angelic\\nsmile played always about her lips, as ruddy as a little girl\\'s who has\\nknown no kisses but her mother\\'s. When he saw her so trustful, so\\npassionate, so pure, living solely with the heart and not realizing that\\nher lover\\'s heart was in torment when he was at her feet, Raymon dared\\nnot be a man, lest he should seem to her inferior to her dreams of him,\\nand, through self-love, he became as virtuous as she.\\n\\nMadame Delmare, ignorant as a genuine creole, had never dreamed hitherto\\nof considering the momentous questions that were now discussed before\\nher every day. She had been brought up by Sir Ralph, who had a poor\\nopinion of the intelligence and reasoning power of womankind, and who\\nhad confined himself to imparting some positive information likely to be\\nof immediate use. Thus she had a very shadowy idea of the world\\'s\\nhistory, and any serious discussion bored her to death. But when she\\nheard Raymon apply to those dry subjects all the charm of his wit, all\\nthe poesy of his language, she listened and tried to understand; then\\nshe ventured timidly to ask ingenuous questions which a girl of ten\\nbrought up according to worldly ideas would readily have answered.\\nRaymon took pleasure in enlightening that virgin mind which seemed\\ndestined to open to receive his principles; but, despite the power he\\nexerted over her untrained, artless mind, his sophisms sometimes\\nencountered resistance from her.\\n\\nIndiana opposed to the interests of civilization, when raised to the\\ndignity of principles of action, the straight-forward ideas and simple\\nlaws of good sense and humanity; her arguments were characterized by an\\nunpolished freedom which sometimes embarrassed Raymon and always charmed\\nhim by its childlike originality. He applied himself as to a task of\\nserious importance to the attempt to bring her around gradually to his\\nprinciples, to his beliefs. He would have been proud to dominate her\\nconscientious and naturally enlightened convictions; but he had some\\ndifficulty in attaining his end. Ralph\\'s generous theories, his\\nunbending hatred of the vices of society, his keen impatience for the\\nreign of other laws and other morals were sentiments to which Indiana\\'s\\nunhappy memories responded. But Raymon suddenly unhorsed his adversary\\nby demonstrating that this aversion for the present was the work of\\nselfishness; he described with much warmth his own attachments, his\\ndevotion to the royal family, which he had the art to clothe with all\\nthe heroism of a perilous loyalty, his respect for the persecuted faith\\nof his fathers, his religious sentiments, which were not the fruit of\\nreasoning, he said, but to which he clung by instinct and from\\nnecessity. And the joy of loving one\\'s fellow-creatures, of being bound\\nto the present generation by all the ties of honor and philanthropy; the\\npleasure of serving one\\'s country by repelling dangerous innovations, by\\nmaintaining domestic peace, by giving, if need be, all one\\'s blood to\\nsave the shedding of one drop of that of the lowest of one\\'s countrymen!\\nhe depicted all these attractive Utopian visions with so much art and\\ncharm that Indiana submitted to be led on to the feeling that she must\\nlove and respect all that Raymon loved and respected. It was fairly\\nproved that Ralph was an egotist; when he maintained a generous idea,\\nthey smiled; it was clear that at such times his heart and his mind were\\nin contradiction. Was it not better to believe Raymon, who had such a\\nbig, warm, expansive heart?\\n\\nThere were moments, however, when Raymon almost forgot his love to think\\nonly of his antipathy. When he was with Madame Delmare, he could see\\nnobody but Sir Ralph, who presumed, with his rough, cool common sense,\\nto attack him, a man of superior talents, who had overthrown such\\ndoughty adversaries! He was humiliated to find himself engaged with so\\npaltry an adversary, and thereupon would overwhelm him with the weight\\nof his eloquence; he would bring into play all the resources of his\\ntalent, and Ralph, bewildered, slow in collecting his ideas, slower\\nstill in expressing them, would be made painfully conscious of his\\nweakness.\\n\\nAt such moments it seemed to Indiana that Raymon\\'s thoughts were\\naltogether diverted from her; she had spasms of anxiety and terror as\\nshe reflected that perhaps all those noble and high-sounding sentiments\\nso eloquently declaimed were simply the pompous scaffolding of words,\\nthe ironical harangue of the lawyer, listening to himself and practising\\nthe comedy which is to take by surprise the good-nature of the tribunal.\\nShe was especially fearful when, as her eyes met his, she fancied that\\nshe saw gleaming in them, not the pleasure of having been understood by\\nher, but the triumphant self-satisfaction of having made a fine\\nargument. She was afraid at such times, and her thoughts turned to\\nRalph, the egotist, to whom they had perhaps been unjust; but Ralph was\\nnot tactful enough to say anything to prolong this uncertainty, and\\nRaymon was very skilful in removing it.\\n\\nThus there was but one really perturbed existence, but one really ruined\\nhappiness in that domestic circle: the existence and happiness of Sir\\nRalph Brown, a man born to misfortune, for whom life had displayed no\\nbrilliant aspects, no intense, heart-filling joys; a victim of great but\\nsecret unhappiness, who complained to no one and whom no one pitied; a\\ntruly accursed destiny, in the poetic sense without thrilling\\nadventures; a commonplace, bourgeois, melancholy destiny, which no\\nfriendship had sweetened, no love charmed, which was endured in silence,\\nwith the heroism which the love of life and the need of hoping give; a\\nlonely mortal who had had a father and mother like everybody else, a\\nbrother, a wife, a son, a friend, and who had reaped no benefit,\\nretained nothing of all those ties; a stranger in life who went his way\\nmelancholy and indifferent, having not even that exalted consciousness\\nof his misfortune which enables one to find some fascination in sorrow.\\n\\nDespite his strength of character, he sometimes felt discouraged with\\nvirtue. He hated Raymon, and it was in his power to drive him from Lagny\\nwith a word; but he did not say it, because he had one belief, a single\\none, which was stronger than Raymon\\'s countless beliefs. It was neither\\nthe church, nor the monarchy, nor society, nor reputation, nor the law,\\nwhich dictated his sacrifices and his courage--it was his conscience.\\n\\nHe had lived so alone that he had not accustomed himself to rely upon\\nothers; but he had learned, in his isolation, to know himself. He had\\nmade a friend of his own heart; by dint of self-communion, of asking\\nhimself the cause of the unjust acts of others, he had assured himself\\nthat he had not earned them by any vice; he had ceased to be irritated\\nby them, because he set little store by his own personality, which he\\nknew to be insipid and commonplace. He understood the indifference of\\nwhich he was the object, and he had chosen his course with regard to it;\\nbut his heart told him that he was capable of feeling all that he did\\nnot inspire, and, while he was disposed to forgive everything in others,\\nhe had decided to tolerate nothing in himself. This wholly inward life,\\nthese wholly private sensations gave him all the outward appearance of a\\nselfish man; indeed nothing resembles selfishness more closely than\\nself-respect.\\n\\nHowever, as it often happens that, because we attempt to do too much\\ngood, we do much less than enough, it happened that Sir Ralph made a\\ngreat mistake from over-scrupulousness and caused Madame Delmare an\\nirreparable injury from dread of burdening his own conscience with a\\ncause of reproach. That mistake was his failure to enlighten her as to\\nthe real reasons of Noun\\'s death. Had he done so she would doubtless\\nhave reflected on the perils of her love for Raymon; but we shall see\\nlater why Monsieur Brown dared not inform his cousin and what painful\\nscruples led him to keep silence on so momentous a question. When he\\ndecided to break his silence it was too late; Raymon had had time to\\nestablish his empire.\\n\\nAn unforeseen event occurred to cloud the future prospects of the\\ncolonel and his wife; a business house in Belgium, upon which all the\\nprosperity of the Delmare establishment depended, had suddenly failed,\\nand the colonel, who had hardly recovered his health, started in hot\\nhaste for Antwerp.\\n\\nHe was still so weak and ill that his wife wished to accompany him; but\\nMonsieur Delmare, being threatened with complete ruin and resolved to\\nhonor all his obligations, feared that his journey would then seem too\\nmuch like a flight; so he determined to leave his wife at Lagny as a\\npledge of his return. He even declined the company of Sir Ralph and\\nbegged him to remain and stand by Madame Delmare in case of any trouble\\non the part of anxious or over-eager creditors.\\n\\nAt this painful crisis Indiana was alarmed at nothing save the\\npossibility of having to leave Lagny and be separated from Raymon; but\\nhe comforted her by convincing her that the colonel would surely go to\\nParis. Moreover he gave her his word that he would follow her, on some\\npretext or other, wherever she might go, and the credulous creature\\ndeemed herself almost happy in a misfortune which enabled her to put\\nRaymon\\'s love to the test. As for him, a vague hope, a persistent,\\nimportunate thought had absorbed his mind ever since he had heard of\\nthis event: he was to be alone with Indiana at last, the first time for\\nsix months. She had never seemed to attempt to avoid a tête-à-tête,\\nand although he was in no haste to triumph over a love whose ingenuous\\nchastity had for him the attraction of novelty, he was beginning to feel\\nthat his honor was involved in bringing it to some conclusion. He\\nhonorably repelled any malicious insinuation concerning his relations\\nwith Madame Delmare; he declared very modestly that there was nothing\\nmore than a placid and pleasant friendship between them; but not for\\nanything in the world would he have admitted, even to his best friend,\\nthat he had been passionately in love for six months and had as yet\\nobtained no fruit of that love.\\n\\nHe was somewhat disappointed in his anticipations when he saw that Sir\\nRalph seemed determined to replace Monsieur Delmare so far as\\nsurveillance was concerned, that he appeared at Lagny in the morning and\\ndid not return to Bellerive until night; indeed, as their road was the\\nsame for some distance, Ralph, with an intolerable affectation of\\ncourtesy, insisted upon timing his departure by Raymon\\'s. This\\nconstraint soon became intensely disagreeable to Monsieur de Ramière,\\nand Madame Delmare fancied that she could detect in it not only a\\nsuspicion insulting to herself, but a purpose to assume despotic control\\nover her conduct.\\n\\nRaymon dared not request a secret interview; whenever he had made the\\nattempt, Madame Delmare had reminded him of certain conditions agreed\\nupon between them. Meanwhile a week had passed since the colonel\\'s\\ndeparture; he might return very soon; the present opportunity must be\\nturned to advantage. To allow Sir Ralph the victory would be a disgrace\\nto Raymon. One morning he slipped this letter into Madame Delmare\\'s\\nhand:\\n\\n\"Indiana! do you not love me as I love you? My angel! I am unhappy and\\nyou do not see it. I am sad, anxious concerning your future, not my own;\\nfor, wherever you may be, there I shall live and die. But the thought of\\npoverty alarms me on your account; ill and frail as you are, my poor\\nchild, how will you endure privation? You have a rich and generous\\ncousin: your husband will perhaps accept at his hands what he will\\nrefuse at mine. Ralph will ameliorate your lot, and I shall be able to\\ndo nothing for you!\\n\\n\"Be sure, be sure, my dear love, that I have reason to be depressed and\\ndisappointed. You are heroic, you laugh at everything, you insist that I\\nmust not grieve. Ah! how I crave your gentle words, your sweet glances,\\nto sustain my courage! But, by a monstrous fatality, these days that I\\nhoped to pass freely at your feet, have brought me nothing but a\\nconstraint that grows ever more galling.\\n\\n\"Say a word, Indiana, so that we may be alone at least an hour, that I\\nmay weep upon your white hands and tell you all that I suffer, and that\\na word from you may console and comfort me.\\n\\n\"And then, Indiana, I have a childish caprice, a genuine lover\\'s\\ncaprice. I would like to enter your room. Oh! don\\'t be frightened, my\\ngentle creole! It is my bounden duty not only to respect you, but to\\nfear you; that is the very reason why I would like to enter your room,\\nto kneel in that place where you were so angry with me, and where, bold\\nas I am, I dared not look at you. I would like to prostrate myself\\nthere, to pass a meditative, happy hour there; I would crave no other\\nfavor, Indiana, than that you should place your hand on my heart and\\ncleanse it of its crime, pacify it if it beats too rapidly, and give it\\nyour confidence once more if you find me worthy of you at last. Yes! I\\nwould like to prove to you that now I am worthy, that I know you through\\nand through, that I worship you with an adoration as pure and holy as\\never maiden conceived for her Madonna! I would like to be sure that you\\nno longer fear me, that you esteem me as much as I revere you; I would\\nlike to live an hour as angels live, with my head upon your heart. Tell\\nme, Indiana, may I? One hour--the first, perhaps the last!\\n\\n\"It is time to forgive me, Indiana, to give me back your confidence, so\\ncruelly snatched from me, so dearly redeemed. Are you not satisfied with\\nme? Have I not passed six months behind your chair, confining my desires\\nto a glance at your snow-white neck through the curls of your black\\nhair, as you leaned over your work, to a breath of the perfume which\\nemanates from you and which the air from the window at which you sit\\nbrings faintly to my nostrils? Does not such submission deserve the\\nreward of a kiss? a sister\\'s kiss, if you will, a kiss on the forehead?\\nI will remain true to our agreements, I swear it. I will ask for\\nnothing. But, cruel one, will you grant me nothing? Are you afraid of\\nyourself?\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare went to her room to read this letter; she replied to it\\ninstantly, and handed him the reply with a key to the park-gate, which\\nhe knew too well.\\n\\n\"I afraid of you, Raymon? Oh! no, not now. I know too well that you love\\nme, I am too blissfully happy in the belief that you love me. Come then,\\nfor I am not afraid of myself either; if I loved you less, perhaps I\\nshould be less calm; but I love you with a love of which you yourself\\nhave no idea. Go away early, so that Ralph may suspect nothing. Return\\nat midnight; you are familiar with the park and the house; here is the\\nkey of the small gate; lock it after you.\"\\n\\nThis ingenuous, generous confidence made Raymon blush. He had tried to\\ninspire it, with the purpose of abusing it; he had counted on the\\ndarkness, the opportunity, the danger. If Indiana had shown any fear,\\nshe was lost; but she was perfectly calm; she placed her trust in his\\ngood faith; he swore that he would give her no cause to repent. But the\\nimportant point was to pass a night in her bedroom, in order not to be a\\nfool in his own eyes, in order to defeat Ralph\\'s prudence, and to be\\nable to laugh at him in his sleeve. That was a personal gratification\\nwhich he craved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI\\n\\n\\nBut Ralph was really intolerable on this particular evening; he had\\nnever been more stupid and dull and tiresome. He could say nothing\\napropos, and, to cap the climax of his loutishness, he gave no sign of\\ntaking his leave even when the evening was far advanced. Madame Delmare\\nbegan to be ill at ease; she glanced alternately at the clock, which had\\nstruck eleven--at the door, which had creaked in the wind--and at the\\nexpressionless face of her cousin, who sat opposite her in front of the\\nfire, placidly watching the blaze without seeming to suspect that his\\npresence was distasteful.\\n\\nBut Sir Ralph\\'s tranquil mask, his petrified features, concealed at that\\nmoment a profound and painful mental agitation. He was a man whom\\nnothing escaped because he observed everything with perfect\\nself-possession. He had not been deceived by Raymon\\'s pretended\\ndeparture; he perceived very plainly Madame Delmare\\'s anxiety at that\\nmoment. He suffered more than she did herself, and he moved irresolutely\\nbetween the impulse to give her a salutary warning and the fear of\\ngiving way to feelings which he disavowed; at last his cousin\\'s interest\\ncarried the day, and he summoned all his moral courage in order to break\\nthe silence.\\n\\n\"That reminds me,\" he said abruptly, following out the line of thought\\nwith which his mind was busy, \"that it was just a year ago to-day that\\nyou and I sat in this chimney-corner as we are sitting now. The clock\\nmarked almost the same hour; the weather was cold and threatening as it\\nis to-night. You were ill, and were disturbed by melancholy ideas; a\\nfact that almost makes me believe in the truth of presentiments.\"\\n\\n\"What can he be coming to?\" thought Madame Delmare, gazing at her cousin\\nwith mingled surprise and uneasiness.\\n\\n\"Do you remember, Indiana,\" he continued, \"that you felt even less well\\nthan usual that night? Why, I can remember your words as if I had just\\nheard them. \\'You will call me insane,\\' you said, \\'but some danger is\\nhovering about us and threatening some one of us--threatening me, I have\\nno doubt,\\' you added; \\'I feel intensely agitated, as if some great\\ncrisis in my destiny were at hand--I am afraid!\\' Those are your very\\nwords.\"\\n\\n\"I am no longer ill,\" said Indiana, who had suddenly turned as pale as\\nat the time of which Sir Ralph spoke; \"I no longer believe in such\\nfoolish terrors.\"\\n\\n\"But I believe in them,\" he rejoined, \"for you were a true prophet that\\nnight, Indiana; a great danger did threaten us--a disastrous influence\\nsurrounded this peaceful abode.\"\\n\\n\"_Mon Dieu!_ I do not understand you!\"\\n\\n\"You soon will understand me, my poor girl. That was the evening that\\nRaymon de Ramière was brought here. Do you remember in what condition?\"\\n\\nRalph paused a few seconds, but dared not look at his cousin. As she\\nmade no reply, he continued:\\n\\n\"I was told to bring him back to life and I did so, as much to satisfy\\nyou as to obey the instincts of humanity; but, in truth, Indiana, it was\\na great misfortune that I saved that man\\'s life! It was I who did all\\nthe harm.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean by harm!\" rejoined Indiana, dryly.\\n\\nShe was deeply moved in advance by the explanation which she foresaw.\\n\\n\"I mean that unfortunate creature\\'s death,\" said Ralph. \"But for him she\\nwould still be alive; but for his fatal love the lovely, honest girl who\\nloved you so dearly would still be at your side.\"\\n\\nThus far Madame Delmare did not understand. She was exasperated beyond\\nmeasure by the strange and cruel method which her cousin adopted to\\nreproach her for her attachment to Monsieur de Ramière.\\n\\n\"Enough of this,\" she said, rising.\\n\\nBut Ralph apparently took no notice of her remark.\\n\\n\"What always astonished me,\" he continued, \"was that you never guessed\\nthe real motive that led Monsieur de Ramière to scale the walls.\"\\n\\nA suspicion darted through Indiana\\'s mind; her legs trembled under her,\\nand she resumed her seat.\\n\\nRalph had buried the knife in her breast and made a ghastly wound. He no\\nsooner saw the effect of his work than he hated himself for it; he\\nthought only of the injury he had inflicted on the person whom he loved\\nbest in all the world; he felt that his heart was breaking. He would\\nhave wept bitterly if he could have wept; but the poor fellow had not\\nthe gift of tears; he had naught of that which eloquently translates the\\nlanguage of the heart. The external coolness with which he performed the\\ncruel operation gave him the air of an executioner in Indiana\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"This is the first time,\" she said bitterly, \"that I have known your\\nantipathy for Monsieur de Ramière to lead you to employ weapons that\\nare unworthy of you; but I do not see how it assists your vengeance to\\nstain the memory of a person who was dear to me, and whom her melancholy\\nend should have made sacred to us. I have asked you no questions, Sir\\nRalph; I do not know what you refer to. With your permission I will\\nlisten to no more.\"\\n\\nShe rose and left Monsieur Brown bewildered and crushed.\\n\\nHe had foreseen that he could not enlighten Madame Delmare except at his\\nown expense. His conscience had told him that he must speak, whatever\\nthe result might be, and he had done it with all the abruptness of\\nmethod, all the awkwardness of execution of which he was capable. What\\nhe had not fully appreciated was the violence of a remedy so long\\ndelayed.\\n\\nHe left Lagny in despair and wandered through the forest in a sort of\\nfrenzy.\\n\\nIt was midnight; Raymon was at the park gate. He opened it, but as he\\nopened it he felt his brow grow chill. For what purpose had he come to\\nthis rendezvous? He had made divers virtuous resolutions, but would he\\nbe amply rewarded by a chaste interview, by a sisterly kiss, for the\\ntorture he was undergoing at that moment? For, if you remember under\\nwhat circumstances he had previously passed through those garden paths,\\nstealthily, at night, you will understand that it required a certain\\ndegree of moral courage to go in search of pleasure along such a road\\nand amid such memories.\\n\\nLate in October the climate of the suburbs of Paris becomes damp and\\nfoggy, especially at night and in the neighborhood of streams. Chance\\ndecreed that the fog should be as dense on this night as on certain\\nother nights in the preceding spring. Raymon felt his way along the\\nmist-enveloped trees. He passed a summer-house which contained a fine\\ncollection of geraniums in winter. He glanced at the door, and his heart\\nbeat fast at the extravagant idea that it might open and give egress to\\na woman wrapped in a pelisse. Raymon smiled at this superstitious\\nweakness and went his way. Nevertheless the cold seized him, and he felt\\nan unpleasant tightness at his throat as he approached the stream.\\n\\nHe had to cross it to reach the flower-garden, and the only means of\\ncrossing in that vicinity was a narrow wooden bridge. The fog became\\nmore dismal than ever over the river-bed, and Raymon clung to the\\nrailing of the bridge in order not to go astray among the reeds that\\ngrew along the banks. The moon was just rising, and, as it strove to\\npierce the vapors, cast an uncertain light on the plants which the wind\\nand the current moved to and fro. In the breeze which rustled the leaves\\nand ruffled the surface of the water there was a sort of wailing sound\\nlike human words half-spoken. There was a faint sob close beside Raymon\\nand a sudden movement among the reeds; it was a curlew flying away at\\nhis approach. The cry of that shore-bird closely resembles the moaning\\nof an abandoned child; and when it comes up from among the reeds you\\nwould say that it was the last effort of a drowning man. Perhaps you\\nwill consider that Raymon was very weak and cowardly; his teeth\\nchattered and he nearly fell; but he soon realized the absurdity of his\\nterror and crossed the bridge.\\n\\nHe was half-way across when a human figure appeared in front of him, at\\nthe end of the rail, as if waiting for him to approach. Raymon\\'s ideas\\nbecame confused; his bewildered brain had not the strength to reason. He\\nretraced his steps and hid among the trees, gazing with a fixed,\\nterrified stare at that ill-defined apparition which remained in the\\nsame place, as vague and uncertain as the river mist and the trembling\\nrays of the moon. He was beginning to believe that in his mental\\npreoccupation he had been deceived, and that what he took for a human\\nform was only a tree-trunk or the stalk of a shrub, when he distinctly\\nsaw it move and walk toward him.\\n\\nAt that moment, had not his legs absolutely refused to act, he would\\nhave fled in as great a panic as the child who passes a cemetery at\\nnight and fancies that he hears mysterious steps running after him on\\nthe tips of the blades of grass. But he felt as if he were paralyzed,\\nand, to support himself, threw his arms around the trunk of the willow\\nbehind which he was hidden. The next moment Sir Ralph, wrapped in a\\nlight cloak which gave him the aspect of a phantom at three yards,\\npassed very close to him and took the path by which he had just come.\\n\\n\"Bungling spy!\" thought Raymon, as he saw him looking for his\\nfootprints. \"I will escape your cowardly surveillance, and while you are\\nmounting guard here I will be enjoying myself yonder.\"\\n\\nHe crossed the bridge as lightly as a bird, and with the confidence of a\\nlover. His terrors were at an end; Noun had never existed; real life was\\nawakening all about him; Indiana awaited him yonder; and Ralph was on\\nsentry-go to keep him from entering.\\n\\n\"Watch closely,\" said Raymon, gayly, as he saw him in the distance going\\nin the opposite direction. \"Watch for me, dear Sir Rodolphe Brown;\\nprotect my good fortune, O my officious friend; and, if the dogs are\\nrestless, if the servants wake, pacify them, keep them quiet by saying:\\n\\'It is I who am watching, sleep in peace.\\'\"\\n\\nScruples, remorse, virtue were at an end for Raymon; he had paid dearly\\nenough for the hour that was striking. His blood that had frozen in his\\nveins flowed now toward his brain with maddening violence. A moment ago\\nthe pallid terrors of death, dismal visions of the tomb; now the\\nimpetuous realities of love, the keen joys of life. Raymon felt as bold\\nand full of animation as in the morning, when an ugly dream has\\nenveloped us in its shroud and suddenly a merry sunbeam awakens and\\nrevivifies us.\\n\\n\"Poor Ralph!\" he thought as he ascended the secret staircase with a\\nbold, light step, \"you would have it so!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART THIRD\\n\\n\\nXVII\\n\\n\\nOn leaving Sir Ralph, Madame Delmare had locked herself into her room,\\nand a thousand tempestuous thoughts had invaded her mind. It was not the\\nfirst time that a vague suspicion had cast its ominous light upon the\\nfragile edifice of her happiness. Monsieur Delmare had previously let\\nslip in conversation some of those indelicate jests which pass for\\ncompliments. He had complimented Raymon on his knightly triumphs in a\\nway to give the cue to ears that knew naught of the incident. Every time\\nthat Madame Delmare had spoken to the gardener, Noun\\'s name had been\\ninjected, as if by an unavoidable necessity, into the most trivial\\ndetails, and then Monsieur de Ramière\\'s had always glided in by virtue\\nof some mysterious junction of ideas which seemed to have taken\\npossession of the man\\'s brain and to beset him in spite of himself.\\nMadame Delmare had been struck by his strange and bungling questions. He\\nbecame confused in his speech on the slightest pretext; he seemed to be\\noppressed by a burden of remorse which he betrayed while struggling to\\nconceal it. At other times Indiana had found in Raymon\\'s own confusion\\nthose indications which she did not seek, but which forced themselves\\nupon her. One circumstance in particular would have enlightened her\\nfurther, if she had not closed her mind to all distrust. They had found\\non Noun\\'s finger a very handsome ring which Madame Delmare had noticed\\nsome time before her death and which the girl claimed to have found.\\nSince her death Madame Delmare had always worn that pledge of sorrow,\\nand she had often noticed that Raymon changed color when he took her\\nhand to put it to his lips. Once he had begged her never to mention Noun\\nto him because he looked upon himself as the cause of her death; and\\nwhen she sought to banish that painful thought by taking all the blame\\nto herself, he had replied:\\n\\n\"No, my poor Indiana, do not accuse yourself; you have no idea how\\nguilty I am.\"\\n\\nThose words, uttered in a bitter, gloomy tone, had alarmed Madame\\nDelmare. She had not dared to insist, and, now that she was beginning to\\nunderstand all these fragments of discoveries, she had not the courage\\nto fix her thoughts upon them and put them together.\\n\\nShe opened her window, and, as she looked out upon the calm night, upon\\nthe moon so pale and lovely behind the silvery vapors on the horizon, as\\nshe remembered that Raymon was coming, that he was perhaps in the park\\neven now, and thought of all the joy she had anticipated in that hour of\\nlove and mystery, she cursed Ralph who with a word had poisoned her hope\\nand destroyed her repose forever. She even felt that she hated him, the\\nunhappy man who had been a father to her and who had sacrificed his\\nfuture for her; for his future was Indiana\\'s friendship; that was his\\nonly treasure, and he resigned himself to the certainty of forfeiting it\\nin order to save her.\\n\\nIndiana could not read in the depths of his heart, nor had she been able\\nto fathom Raymon\\'s. She was unjust, not from ingratitude, but from\\nignorance. Being under the influence of a strong passion she could not\\nbut feel strongly the blow that had been dealt her. For an instant she\\nlaid the whole crime upon Ralph, preferring to accuse him rather than to\\nsuspect Raymon.\\n\\nAnd then she had so little time to collect her thoughts, and make up her\\nmind: Raymon was coming. Perhaps it was he whom she had seen for some\\nminutes wandering about the little bridge. How much more intense would\\nher aversion for Ralph have been at that moment, if she could have\\nrecognized him in that vague figure, which constantly appeared and\\ndisappeared in the mist, and which, like a spirit stationed at the gate\\nof the Elysian Fields, sought to keep the guilty man from entering!\\n\\nSuddenly there came to her mind one of those strange, half-formed ideas,\\nwhich only restless and unhappy persons are capable of conceiving. She\\nrisked her whole destiny upon a strange and delicate test against which\\nRaymon could not be on his guard. She had hardly completed her\\nmysterious preparations when she heard Raymon\\'s footsteps on the secret\\nstairway. She ran and unlocked the door, then returned to her chair, so\\nagitated that she felt that she was on the point of falling; but, as in\\nall the great crises of her life, she retained a remarkable clearness of\\nperception and great strength of mind.\\n\\nRaymon was still pale and breathless when he opened the door; impatient\\nto see the light, to grasp reality once more. Indiana\\'s back was turned\\nto him, she was wrapped in a fur-lined pelisse. By a strange chance it\\nwas the same that Noun wore when she went to meet him in the park at\\ntheir last rendezvous. I do not know if you remember that at that time\\nRaymon had had for an instant the untenable idea that that woman\\nshrouded in her cloak was Madame Delmare. Now, when he saw once more the\\nsame apparition sitting inert in a chair, with her head on her breast,\\nby the light of a pale, flickering lamp, on the same spot where so many\\nmemories awaited him, in that room which he had not entered since the\\ndarkest night in his life and which was full to overflowing of his\\nremorse, he involuntarily recoiled and remained in the doorway, his\\nterrified gaze fixed upon that motionless figure, and trembling like a\\ncoward, lest, when it turned, it should display the livid features of a\\ndrowned woman.\\n\\nMadame Delmare had no suspicion of the effect she produced upon Raymon.\\nShe had wound about her head a handkerchief of India silk, tied\\ncarelessly in true creole style; it was Noun\\'s usual head-dress. Raymon,\\nfairly overcome by terror, nearly fell backward, thinking that his\\nsuperstitious fancies were realized. But, recognizing the woman he had\\ncome to seduce, he forgot the one whom he had seduced and walked toward\\nher. Her face wore a grave, meditative expression: she gazed earnestly\\nat him, but with close attention rather than affection, and did not make\\na motion to draw him to her side more quickly.\\n\\nRaymon, surprised by this reception, attributed it to some scruple of\\nchastity, to some girlish impulse of delicacy or constraint. He knelt at\\nher feet, saying:\\n\\n\"Are you afraid of me, my beloved?\" But at that moment he noticed that\\nMadame Delmare held something in her hands to which she seemed to direct\\nhis attention with a playful affectation of gravity. He looked more\\nclosely and saw a mass of black hair, of varying lengths, which seemed\\nto have been cut in haste, and which Indiana was smoothing with her\\nhand.\\n\\n\"Do you recognize it?\" she asked, fastening upon him her limpid eyes, in\\nwhich there was a peculiar, penetrating gleam.\\n\\nRaymon hesitated, looked again at the handkerchief about her head, and\\nthought that he understood.\\n\\n\"Naughty girl!\" he said, taking the hair in his hand, \"why did you cut\\nit off? It was so beautiful, and I loved it so dearly!\"\\n\\n\"You asked me yesterday,\" she said with the shadow of a smile, \"if I\\nwould sacrifice it to you.\"\\n\\n\"O Indiana!\" cried Raymon, \"you know well that you will be lovelier than\\never to me henceforth. Give it to me. I do not choose to regret the\\nabsence from your head of that glorious hair which I admired every day,\\nand which now I can kiss every day without restraint. Give it to me, so\\nthat it may never leave me.\"\\n\\nBut as he gathered up in his hand that luxuriant mass of which some\\nlocks reached to the floor, Raymon fancied that it had a dry, rough\\nfeeling which his fingers had never noticed in the silken tresses over\\nIndiana\\'s forehead. He was conscious, also, of an indefinable nervous\\nthrill, it felt so cold and dead, as if it had been cut a long time, and\\nseemed to have lost its perfumed moisture and vital warmth. Then he\\nlooked at it again, and sought in vain the blue gleam which made\\nIndiana\\'s hair resemble the blue-black wing of the crow; this was of an\\nEthiopian black, of an Indian texture, of a lifeless heaviness.\\n\\nIndiana\\'s bright piercing eyes followed Raymon\\'s. He turned them\\ninvoluntarily upon an open ebony casket from which several locks of the\\nsame hair protruded.\\n\\n\"This is not yours,\" he said, untying the kerchief which concealed\\nMadame Delmare\\'s hair.\\n\\nIt was untouched, and fell over her shoulders in all its splendor. But\\nshe made a gesture as if to push him away and said, still pointing to\\nthe hair:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you recognize this? Did you never admire, never caress it? Has\\nthe damp night air robbed it of all its fragrance? Have you not a\\nthought, a tear for her who wore this ring?\"\\n\\nRaymon sank upon a chair; Noun\\'s locks fell from his trembling hand. So\\nmuch painful excitement had exhausted him. He was a man of choleric\\ntemper, whose blood flowed rapidly, whose nerves were easily and deeply\\nirritated. He shivered from head to foot and fell in a swoon on the\\nfloor.\\n\\nWhen he came to himself, Madame Delmare was on her knees beside him,\\nweeping copiously and asking his forgiveness; but Raymon no longer loved\\nher.\\n\\n\"You have inflicted a horrible wound on me,\" he said; \"a wound which it\\nis not in your power to cure. You will never restore the confidence I\\nhad in your heart; that is evident to me. You have shown me how\\nvindictive and cruel your heart can be. Poor Noun! poor unhappy girl! It\\nwas she whom I treated badly, not you; it was she who had the right to\\navenge herself, and she did not. She took her own life in order to leave\\nme the future. She sacrificed herself to my repose. You are not the\\nwoman to have done as much, madame! Give me her hair; it is mine--it\\nbelongs to me; it is all that remains to me of the only woman who ever\\nloved me truly. Unhappy Noun! you were worthy of a better love! And you,\\nmadame, dare to reproach me with her death; you, whom I loved so well\\nthat I forgot her--that I defied the ghastly torture of remorse; you\\nwho, on the faith of a kiss, have led me across that river--across that\\nbridge--alone, with terror at my side, pursued by the infernal illusions\\nof my crime! And when you discover with what a frantic passion I love\\nyou, you bury your woman\\'s nails in my heart, seeking there another drop\\nof blood which may still be made to flow for you! Ah! when I spurned so\\ndevoted a love to take up with so savage a passion as yours, I was no\\nless mad than guilty.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare did not reply. Pale and motionless, with dishevelled hair\\nand staring eyes, she moved Raymon to pity. He took her hand.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" he said, \"this love I feel for you is so blind that, in spite\\nof myself, I can still forget the past and the present--the sin that\\nblasted my life and the crime you have just committed. So love me, and I\\nwill forgive you.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare\\'s despair rekindled desire and pride in her lover\\'s\\nheart. When he saw how dismayed she was at the thought of losing his\\nlove--how humble before him, how resigned to accept his decrees for the\\nfuture by way of atonement for the past--he remembered what his\\nintentions had been when he eluded Ralph\\'s vigilance, and he realized\\nall the advantages of his position. He pretended to be absorbed in a\\nmelancholy, sombre reverie for some moments; he hardly responded to\\nIndiana\\'s tears and caresses. He waited until her heart should break and\\noverflow in sobs, until she should realize all the horrors of\\ndesertion--until she should have exhausted all her strength in\\nheart-rending emotion; and then, when he saw her at his feet, fainting,\\nutterly worn out, awaiting death at a word from him, he seized her in\\nhis arms with convulsive passion and strained her to his heart. She\\nyielded like a weak child; she abandoned her lips to him unresistingly.\\nShe was almost dead.\\n\\nBut suddenly, as if waking from a dream, she snatched herself away from\\nhis burning caresses, rushed to the end of the room where Sir Ralph\\'s\\nportrait hung on the panel; and, as if she would place herself under the\\nprotection of that grave personage with the unruffled brow and tranquil\\nlips, she shrank back against the portrait, wild-eyed, quivering from\\nhead to foot, in the clutches of a strange fear. It was this that made\\nRaymon think that she had been deeply moved in his arms--that she was\\nafraid of herself--that she was his. He ran to her; drew her by force\\nfrom her retreat, and told her that he had come with the purpose of\\nkeeping his promises, but that her cruel treatment of him had absolved\\nhim from his oath.\\n\\n\"I am no longer either your slave or your ally,\" he said. \"I am simply\\nthe man who loves you madly and who has you in his arms, a wicked,\\ncapricious, cruel, mad creature, but lovely and adored. With sweet,\\nconfiding words you might have cooled my blood. Had you been as calm and\\ngenerous as yesterday, you would have made me mild and submissive as\\nusual. But you have kindled all my passions, overturned all my ideas.\\nYou have made me unhappy, cowardly, ill, frantic, desperate, one after\\nanother. You must make me happy now, or I feel that I can no longer\\nbelieve in you--that I can no longer love you or bless you. Forgive me,\\nIndiana, forgive me! If I frighten you it is your own fault; you have\\nmade me suffer so that I have lost my reason!\"\\n\\nIndiana trembled in every limb. She knew so little of life that she\\nbelieved resistance to be impossible; she was ready to concede from fear\\nwhat she would refuse from love; but, as she struggled feebly in\\nRaymon\\'s arms, she said, in desperation:\\n\\n\"So you are capable of using force with me?\"\\n\\nRaymon paused, impressed with this moral resistance, which survived\\nphysical resistance. He hastily pushed her away.\\n\\n\"Never!\" he cried: \"I would rather die than possess you except by your\\nown will!\"\\n\\nHe threw himself on his knees, and all that the mind can supply in place\\nof the heart, all the poesy that the imagination can impart to the ardor\\nof the blood, he expressed in a fervent and dangerous entreaty. And when\\nhe saw that she did not surrender, he yielded to necessity and\\nreproached her with not loving him; a commonplace expedient which he\\ndespised and which made him smile, with a feeling of something like\\nshame at having to do with a woman so innocent as not to smile at it\\nherself.\\n\\nThat reproach went to Indiana\\'s heart more swiftly than all the\\nexclamations with which Raymon had embellished his discourse.\\n\\nBut suddenly she remembered.\\n\\n\"Raymon,\" she said, \"the other, who loved you so dearly--of whom we were\\nspeaking just now--she refused you nothing, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing!\" exclaimed Raymon, annoyed by this inopportune reminder.\\n\"Instead of reminding me of her so continually, you would do well to\\nmake me forget how dearly she loved me!\"\\n\\n\"Listen!\" rejoined Indiana, thoughtfully and gravely; \"have a little\\ncourage, for I must say something more. Perhaps you have not been as\\nguilty towards me as I thought. It would be sweet to me to be able to\\nforgive you for what I considered a mortal insult. Tell me then--when I\\nsurprised you here--for whom did you come? for her or for me?\"\\n\\nRaymon hesitated; then, as he thought that the truth would soon be known\\nto Madame Delmare, that perhaps she knew it already, he answered:\\n\\n\"For her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I prefer it so,\" she said sadly; \"I prefer an infidelity to an\\ninsult. Be frank to the end, Raymon. How long had you been in my room\\nwhen I came? Remember that Ralph knows all, and that, if I chose to\\nquestion him----\"\\n\\n\"There is no need of Sir Ralph\\'s testimony, madame. I had been here\\nsince the night before.\"\\n\\n\"And you had passed the night in this room. Your silence is a sufficient\\nanswer.\"\\n\\nThey both remained silent for some moments; then Indiana rose and was\\nabout to continue, when a sharp knock at the door checked the flow of\\nthe blood in her veins. Neither she nor Raymon dared to breathe.\\n\\nA paper was slipped under the door. It was a leaf from a note-book on\\nwhich these words were scrawled in pencil, almost illegibly:\\n\\n\"Your husband is here.\\n\\n\"RALPH.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\n\\n\"This is a wretchedly devised falsehood,\" said Raymon, as soon as the\\nsound of Ralph\\'s footsteps had died away. \"Sir Ralph needs a lesson, and\\nI will administer it in such shape----\"\\n\\n\"I forbid it,\" said Indiana, in a cold, determined tone: \"my husband is\\nhere: Ralph never lied. You and I are lost. There was a time when the\\nthought would have frozen me with horror; to-day it matters little to\\nme!\"\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said Raymon, seizing her in his arms excitedly, \"since\\ndeath encompasses us, be mine! Forgive everything, and let your last\\nword in this supreme moment be a word of love, my last breath a breath\\nof joy.\"\\n\\n\"This moment of terror and courage might have been the sweetest moment\\nin my life,\" she said, \"but you have spoiled it for me.\"\\n\\nThere was a rumbling of wheels in the farmyard, and the bell at the gate\\nof the château was rung by a strong and impatient hand.\\n\\n\"I know that ring,\" said Indiana, watchful and cool. \"Ralph did not lie;\\nbut you have time to escape; go!\"\\n\\n\"I will not,\" cried Raymon; \"I suspect some despicable treachery and you\\nshall not be the only victim. I will remain and my breast shall protect\\nyou----\"\\n\\n\"There is no treachery--listen--the servants are stirring and the gate\\nwill be opened directly. Go: the trees in the garden will conceal you,\\nand the moon is not fairly out yet. Not a word more, but go!\"\\n\\nRaymon was compelled to obey; but she accompanied him to the foot of the\\nstairs and cast a searching glance about the flower-garden. All was\\nsilent and calm. She stood a long while on the last stair, listening\\nwith terror to the grinding of his footsteps on the gravel, entirely\\noblivious of her husband\\'s arrival. What cared she for his suspicions\\nand his anger, provided that Raymon was out of danger?\\n\\nAs for him he crossed the stream and hurried swiftly through the park.\\nHe reached the small gate and, in his excitement, had some difficulty in\\nopening it. He was no sooner in the road than Sir Ralph appeared in\\nfront of him and said with as much _sang-froid_ as if he were accosting\\nhim at a party:\\n\\n\"Be good enough to let me have that key. If there should be a search for\\nit, it would be less inconvenient for it to be found in my hands.\"\\n\\nRaymon would have preferred the most deadly insult to this satirical\\ngenerosity.\\n\\n\"I am not the man to forget a well-meant service,\" said he; \"I am the\\nman to avenge an insult and to punish treachery.\"\\n\\nSir Ralph changed neither his tone nor his expression.\\n\\n\"I want none of your gratitude,\" he rejoined, \"and I await your\\nvengeance tranquilly; but this is no time to talk. There is your\\npath--think of Madame Delmare\\'s good name.\"\\n\\nAnd he disappeared.\\n\\nThis night of agitation had overturned Raymon\\'s brain so completely that\\nhe would readily have believed in witchcraft at that moment. He reached\\nCercy at daybreak and went to bed with a raging fever.\\n\\nAs for Madame Delmare, she did the honors of the breakfast table for her\\nhusband and cousin with much calmness and dignity. She had not as yet\\nreflected upon her situation; she was absolutely under the influence of\\ninstinct, which enjoined _sang-froid_ and presence of mind upon her. The\\ncolonel was gloomy and thoughtful, but it was his business alone that\\npreoccupied him, and no jealous suspicion found a place in his thoughts.\\n\\nToward evening Raymon mustered courage to think about his love; but that\\nlove had diminished materially. He loved obstacles; but he hated to be\\nbored and he foresaw that he should be bored times without number now\\nthat Indiana had the right to reproach him. However, he remembered at\\nlast that his honor demanded that he should inquire for her, and he sent\\nhis servant to prowl around Lagny and find out what was going on there.\\nThe servant brought him the following letter which Madame Delmare\\nherself had handed him:\\n\\n\"I hoped last night that I should lose either my reason or my life.\\nUnhappily for me I have retained both; but I will not complain, I have\\ndeserved the suffering that I am undergoing; I chose to live this\\ntempestuous life; it would be cowardly to recoil to-day. I do not know\\nwhether you are guilty, I do not want to know. We will never return to\\nthat subject, will we? It causes us both too much suffering: so let this\\nbe the last time it is mentioned between us.\\n\\n\"You said one thing at which I felt a cruel joy. Poor Noun! from your\\nplace in heaven forgive me! you no longer suffer, you no longer love,\\nperhaps you pity me! You told me, Raymon, that you sacrificed that\\nunhappy girl to me, that you loved me better than her. Oh! do not take\\nit back; you said it, and I feel so strongly the need to believe it that\\nI do believe it. And yet your conduct last night, your entreaties, your\\nwild outbreaks, might well have made me doubt it. I forgave you on\\naccount of the mental disturbance under which you were laboring; but now\\nyou have had time to reflect, to become yourself once more; tell me,\\nwill you renounce loving me in that way? I, who love you with my heart,\\nhave believed hitherto that I could arouse in you a love as pure as my\\nown. And then I had not thought very much about the future; I had not\\nlooked ahead very far, and I had not taken alarm at the thought that the\\nday might come when, conquered by your devotion, I should sacrifice to\\nyou my scruples and my repugnance. But to-day, it can no longer be the\\nsame; I can see in the future only a ghastly parallel between myself and\\nNoun! Oh! the thought of being loved no more than she was! If I believed\\nit! And yet she was lovelier than I, far lovelier! Why did you prefer\\nme? You must have loved me differently and better.--That is what I\\nwanted you to say. Will you give up being my lover in the way that you\\nhave been? In that case I can still esteem you, believe in your remorse,\\nyour sincerity, your love; if not, think of me no more, you will never\\nsee me again. I shall die of it perhaps, but I would rather die than\\ndescend so low as to be your mistress.\"\\n\\nRaymon was sorely embarrassed as to how he should reply. This pride\\noffended him; he had never supposed hitherto that a woman who had thrown\\nherself into his arms could resist him thus outspokenly and give reasons\\nfor her resistance.\\n\\n\"She does not love me,\" he said to himself; \"her heart is dry, she is\\nnaturally overbearing.\"\\n\\nFrom that moment he loved her no longer. She had ruffled his\\nself-esteem; she had disappointed his hope of triumph, defeated his\\nanticipations of pleasure. In his eyes she was no more than Noun had\\nbeen. Poor Indiana! who longed to be so much more! Her passionate love\\nwas misunderstood, her blind confidence was spurned. Raymon had never\\nunderstood her; how could he have continued to love her?\\n\\nThereupon he swore, in his irritation, that he would triumph over her;\\nhe swore it not from a feeling of pride but in a revengeful spirit. It\\nwas no longer a matter of snatching a new pleasure, but of punishing an\\ninsult; of possessing a woman, but of subduing her. He swore that he\\nwould be her master, were it for but a single day, and that then he\\nwould abandon her, to have the satisfaction of seeing her at his feet.\\n\\nOn the spur of the moment he wrote this letter:\\n\\n\"You want me to promise. Foolish girl, can you think of such a thing? I\\nwill promise whatever you choose, because I can do nothing but obey you;\\nbut, if I break my promises I shall be guilty neither to God nor to you.\\nIf you loved me, Indiana, you would not inflict these cruel torments on\\nme, you would not expose me to the risk of perjuring myself, you would\\nnot blush at the thought of being my mistress. But you think that in my\\narms you would be degraded----\"\\n\\nHe felt that his bitterness was making itself manifest, despite his\\nefforts; he tore up this sheet, and, after taking time to reflect, began\\nanew:\\n\\n\"You admit that you nearly lost your reason last night; for my part, I\\nlost mine altogether. I was culpable--but no, I was mad! Forget those\\nhours of suffering and excitement. I am calm now; I have reflected; I am\\nstill worthy of you. Bless you, my angel from heaven, for saving me from\\nmyself, for reminding me how I ought to love you. Now, Indiana, command\\nme! I am your slave, as you well know. I would give my life for an hour\\nin your arms; but I can suffer a whole lifetime to obtain a smile from\\nyou. I will be your friend, your brother, nothing more. If I suffer, you\\nshall not know it. If my blood boils when I am near you, if my breast\\ntakes fire, if a cloud passes before my eyes when I touch your hand, if\\na sweet kiss from your lips, a sisterly kiss, scorches my forehead, I\\nwill order my blood to be calm, my brain to grow cool, my mouth to\\nrespect you. I will be gentle, I will be submissive, I will be\\nunhappy,--if you will be the happier therefor and enjoy my agony,--if\\nonly I may hear you tell me again that you love me! Oh! tell me so! give\\nme back your confidence and my joy! tell me when we shall meet again. I\\nknow not what result the events of last night may have had; how does it\\nhappen that you do not refer to the subject, that you leave me in an\\nagony of suspense? Carle saw you all three walking together in the park.\\nThe colonel seemed ill or depressed, but not angry. In that case that\\nRalph did not betray us! What a strange man! But to what extent can we\\nrely on his discretion; and how shall I dare show myself at Lagny now\\nthat our fate is in his hands? But I will dare. If it is necessary to\\nstoop so low as to implore him, I will silence my pride, I will overcome\\nmy aversion, I will do anything rather than lose you. A word from you\\nand I will burden my life with as much remorse as I am able to carry;\\nfor you I would abandon my mother herself; for you I would commit any\\ncrime. Ah! if you realized the depth of my love, Indiana!\"\\n\\nThe pen fell from Raymon\\'s hands; he was terribly fatigued, he was\\nfalling asleep. But he read over his letter to make sure that his ideas\\nhad not suffered from the influence of drowsiness; but it was impossible\\nfor him to understand his own meaning, his brain was so affected by his\\nphysical exhaustion. He rang for his servant, bade him go to Lagny\\nbefore daybreak; then slept that deep, refreshing sleep whose tranquil\\ndelights only those who are thoroughly satisfied with themselves really\\nknow. Madame Delmare had not retired; she was unconscious of fatigue and\\npassed the night writing. When she received Raymon\\'s letter she answered\\nit in haste:\\n\\n\"Thanks, Raymon, thanks! you restore my strength and my life. Now I can\\ndare anything, endure anything; for you love me, and the most severe\\ntests do not alarm you. Yes, we will meet again--we will defy everybody.\\nRalph may do what he will with our secret. I am no longer disturbed\\nabout anything since you love me; I am not even afraid of my husband.\\n\\n\"You want to know about our affairs? I forgot to mention them yesterday,\\nand yet they have taken a turn which has an important bearing on my\\nfortunes. We are ruined. There is some talk of selling Lagny, and even\\nof going to live in the colonies. But of what consequence is all that? I\\ncannot make up my mind to think about it. I know that we shall never be\\nparted. You have sworn it, Raymon; I rely on your promise, do you rely\\non my courage. Nothing will frighten me, nothing will turn me back. My\\nplace is established at your side, and death alone can tear me from it.\"\\n\\n\"Mere woman\\'s effervescence!\" said Raymon, crumpling the letter.\\n\"Romantic projects, perilous undertakings, appeal to their feeble\\nimaginations as bitter substances arouse a sick man\\'s appetite. I have\\nsucceeded; I have recovered my influence; and, as for all this imprudent\\nfolly with which she threatens me, we will see! It is all characteristic\\nof the light-headed, false creatures, always ready to undertake the\\nimpossible and making of generosity a show virtue which must be attended\\nwith scandal! Who would think, to read this letter, that she counts her\\nkisses and doles out her caresses like a miser!\"\\n\\nThat same day he went to Lagny. Ralph was not there, and the colonel\\nreceived him amicably and talked to him confidentially. He took him into\\nthe park, where they were less likely to be disturbed, and told him that\\nhe was utterly ruined and that the factory would be offered for sale on\\nthe following day. Raymon made generous offers of assistance, but\\nDelmare declined them.\\n\\n\"No, my friend,\" he said, \"I have suffered too much from the thought\\nthat I owed my fate to Ralph\\'s kindness; I was in too much of a hurry to\\nrepay him. The sale of this property will enable me to pay all my debts\\nat once. To be sure, I shall have nothing left, but I have courage,\\nenergy and business experience; the future is before us. I have built up\\nmy little fortune once, and I can begin it again. I must do it for my\\nwife\\'s sake, for she is young, and I don\\'t wish to leave her in poverty.\\nShe still owns an estate of some little value at Ile Bourbon, and I\\npropose to go into retirement there and start in business afresh. In a\\nfew years--in ten years at most--I hope that we shall meet again.\"\\n\\nRaymon pressed the colonel\\'s hand, smiling inwardly at his confidence,\\nat his speaking of ten years as of a single day, when his bald head and\\nenfeebled body indicated a feeble hold upon existence, a life near its\\nclose. Nevertheless he pretended to share his hopes.\\n\\n\"I am delighted to see,\" he said, \"that you do not allow yourself to be\\ncast down by these reverses. I recognize your manly heart, your\\nundaunted courage. But does Madame Delmare display the same courage? Do\\nyou not anticipate some resistance on her part to your project of\\nexpatriation?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be very sorry,\" the colonel replied, \"but wives are made to\\nobey, not to advise. I have not yet definitely made my purpose known to\\nIndiana. With the exception of yourself, my friend, I do not know what\\nthere is here that she should feel any regret at leaving; and yet I\\nanticipate tears and nervous attacks, from a spirit of contradiction, if\\nnothing else. The devil take the women! However, my dear Raymon, I rely\\nupon you all the same to make my wife listen to reason. She has\\nconfidence in you; use your influence to prevent her from crying. I\\ndetest tears.\"\\n\\nRaymon promised to come again the next day and inform Madame Delmare of\\nher husband\\'s decision.\\n\\n\"You will do me a very great favor,\" said the colonel. \"I will take\\nRalph to the farm, so that you may have a good chance to talk with her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, luck is on my side!\" thought Ralph, as he took his leave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX\\n\\n\\nMonsieur Delmare\\'s plans fell in perfectly with Raymon\\'s wishes. He\\nforesaw that this love affair which, so far as he was concerned, was\\ndrawing near its close, would soon bring him nothing but annoyance and\\nimportunity, so that he was very glad to see events arranging themselves\\nin such a way as to save him from the wearisome but inevitable results\\nof a played-out intrigue. It only remained for him to take advantage of\\nMadame Delmare\\'s last moments of excitement, and then to leave to his\\ncomplaisant destiny the task of ridding him of her tears and reproaches.\\n\\nSo he returned to Lagny the next day, intending to exalt the unhappy\\nwoman\\'s enthusiasm to its apogee.\\n\\n\"Do you know, Indiana,\" he said, when they met, \"the part that your\\nhusband has requested me to play with respect to you? A strange\\ncommission, upon my word! I am to entreat you to go with him to Ile\\nBourbon; to urge you to leave me; to tear out my heart and my life. Do\\nyou think that he made a good choice of an advocate?\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare\\'s sombre gravity imposed a sort of respect on Raymon\\'s\\ncunning.\\n\\n\"Why do you come and tell me all this?\" she said. \"Are you afraid that I\\nshall allow myself to be moved? Are you afraid that I shall obey? Never\\nfear, Raymon, my mind is made up; I have passed two nights looking at it\\non every side; I know to what I expose myself; I know what I must defy,\\nwhat I must sacrifice, what I must disdain to notice; I am ready to pass\\nthrough this stormy period of my destiny. Will not you be my support and\\nmy guide?\"\\n\\nRaymon was tempted to take fright at this cool determination and to take\\nthese insane threats seriously; but in a moment he recurred to his\\nformer opinion that Indiana did not really love him, and that she was\\napplying now to her situation the exaggerated sentiments she had learned\\nfrom books. He strove to be eloquent with passion, he devoted his\\nenergies to dramatic improvisation, in order to maintain himself on his\\nromantic mistress\\'s level, and he succeeded in prolonging her error.\\nBut, to a calm and impartial auditor, this love scene would have seemed\\na contest between stage illusion and reality. The grandiloquence of\\nRaymon\\'s sentiments, the poesy of his ideas would have seemed a cold and\\ncruel parody of the real sentiments which Indiana expressed so simply:\\nin the one case mind, in the other heart.\\n\\nRaymon, who however had some little fear that she might carry out her\\npromises if he did not shrewdly undermine the plan of resistance she had\\nformed, persuaded her to counterfeit submission or indifference until\\nsuch time as she could come forth in open rebellion. It was essential,\\nhe said, that they should have left Lagny before she declared herself,\\nin order to avoid a scandal in presence of the servants, and Ralph\\'s\\ndangerous intervention in the affair.\\n\\nBut Ralph did not leave his unfortunate friends. In vain did he offer\\nhis whole fortune, his Bellerive estate, his English consols, and\\nwhatever his plantations in the colonies would bring; the colonel was\\ninflexible. His affection for Ralph had diminished; he was no longer\\nwilling to owe anything to him. Ralph might perhaps have been able to\\nmove him had he possessed Raymon\\'s wit and address; but when he had\\nplainly set forth his ideas and declared his sentiments, the poor\\nbaronet believed that he had said everything, and he never attempted to\\nsecure the retraction of a refusal. So he let Bellerive and followed\\nMonsieur and Madame Delmare to Paris, pending their departure for Ile\\nBourbon.\\n\\nLagny was offered for sale with the factory and the appurtenances. The\\nwinter was a melancholy and depressing one to Madame Delmare. To be\\nsure, Raymon was in Paris, he saw her every day, he was attentive and\\naffectionate; but he remained barely an hour with her. He arrived just\\nafter dinner, and when the colonel went out on business, he also took\\nhis leave to attend some social function or other. Society, you know,\\nwas Raymon\\'s element, his life; he must have the noise, the bustle, the\\ncrowd, to breathe freely, to display all his intellectual power, all his\\nease of manner, all his superiority. In the privacy of the boudoir he\\ncould make himself attractive, in society he became brilliant; and then\\nhe was no longer the man of a small coterie, the friend of this one or\\nthat one; he was the man of intellect who belongs to all alike, and to\\nwhom society is a sort of fatherland.\\n\\nAnd then, as we have said, Raymon had some principle. When the colonel\\nmanifested such confidence in him and esteem for him, when he saw that\\nhe regarded him as the very type of honor and sincerity and desired him\\nto act as mediator between his wife and himself, he determined to\\njustify that confidence, to deserve that esteem, to reconcile that\\nhusband and wife, to repel any attachment on the part of the latter\\nwhich might endanger the repose of the other. He became once more a\\nmoral, virtuous, philosophical person. You will see for how long.\\n\\nIndiana, who did not understand this conversion, suffered horribly to be\\nso neglected; and yet she still had the satisfaction of feeling that her\\nhopes were not entirely destroyed. She was easily deceived; she asked\\nnothing better than to be deceived, her real life was so bitter and\\ndesolate! Her husband had become almost impossible to live with. In\\npublic he affected the heroic courage and indifference of a brave man;\\nbut when he returned to the privacy of his own home he was simply an\\nirritable, severe, absurd child. Indiana was the victim of his disgust\\nwith life, and, we must confess, she was largely to blame. If she had\\nraised her voice, if she had complained, affectionately but forcibly,\\nDelmare, who was only rough, would have blushed at the idea of being\\nconsidered unkind. Nothing was easier than to touch his heart and govern\\nhim absolutely, if one chose to descend to his level and enter into the\\ncircle of ideas that were within the scope of his mind. But Indiana was\\nstiff and haughty in her submissiveness; she always obeyed in silence;\\nbut it was the silence and submissiveness of the slave who has made of\\nhatred a virtue and of unhappiness a merit. Her resignation was the\\ndignity of a king who accepts fetters and a dungeon rather than\\nvoluntarily abdicate his throne and lay aside a vain title. A woman of a\\ncommoner mould would have mastered that commonplace man; she would have\\nsaid what he said and reserved the right to think differently; she would\\nhave pretended to respect his prejudices and secretly have trampled them\\nunder foot; she would have caressed him and deceived him. Indiana saw\\nmany women who acted thus; but she felt so far above them that she would\\nhave blushed to imitate them. Being virtuous and chaste, she thought\\nthat she was not called upon to flatter her master by her words so long\\nas she respected him in his actions. She did not care for his affection\\nbecause she could not respond to it. She would have considered it far\\nmore blameworthy to make a show of love for the husband whom she did not\\nlove, than to give her heart to the lover who inspired love in her. To\\ndeceive was the crime in her eyes, and twenty times a day she felt that\\nshe must declare her love for Raymon; naught detained her but the fear\\nof ruining him. Her impassive obedience irritated the colonel much more\\nthan a cleverly managed rebellion would have done. Although his\\nself-esteem would have suffered if he had ceased to be master in his own\\nhouse, it suffered much more from the consciousness that he was master\\nin a hateful and absurd fashion. He would have liked to convince and he\\nsimply commanded; to reign, and he governed. Sometimes he gave an order\\nthat was awkwardly expressed, or, without reflection, issued orders that\\nwere injurious to his own interests. Madame Delmare saw that they were\\ncarried out without scrutiny, without question, with the indifference of\\nthe horse that draws the plough in one direction or another. Delmare,\\nwhen he saw the result of the failure to understand his ideas, of the\\nmisconstruction of his wishes, would fly into a rage; but when she had\\nproved to him with a few tranquil, icy words that she had simply caused\\nhis orders to be obeyed, he was reduced to the necessity of turning his\\nwrath against himself. It was a cruel pang, a bitter affront to that man\\nof petty self-esteem and of violent passions.\\n\\nSeveral times he would have killed his wife, if he had been at Smyrna or\\nat Cairo. And yet he loved with all his heart that weak woman who lived\\nin subjection to him and kept the secret of his ill-treatment with\\nreligious prudence. He loved her or pitied her--I do not know which. He\\nwould have liked to win her love, for he was proud of her education and\\nof her superiority. He would have risen in his own eyes if she would\\nhave stooped so far as to parley with his ideas and his principles. When\\nhe went to her apartments in the morning with the purpose of picking a\\nquarrel with her, he sometimes found her asleep and dared not wake her.\\nHe would gaze at her in silence; he would take fright at the delicacy of\\nher constitution, the pallor of her cheeks, at the air of calm\\nmelancholy, of resignation to misfortune expressed by that motionless\\nand silent face. He would find in her features innumerable subjects of\\nself-reproach, remorse, anger and dread. He would blush at the thought\\nof the influence which so frail a creature had exerted over his\\ndestiny--he, a man of iron, accustomed to command others, to see whole\\nbattalions, spirited horses and frightened men march at a word from his\\nlips.\\n\\nAnd a wife who was still but a child had made him unhappy! She forced\\nhim to look within himself--to scrutinize his own decisions, to modify\\nmany of them, to retract some of them--and all this without saying: \"You\\nare wrong; I beg that you will do thus or thus.\" She had never implored,\\nshe had never deigned to show herself his equal and to avow herself his\\ncompanion. That woman, whom he could have crushed in his hand if he had\\nchosen, lay there, an insignificant creature, dreaming of another before\\nhis eyes, perhaps, and defying him even in her sleep. He was tempted to\\nstrangle her--to drag her out of bed by the hair, to trample on her and\\nforce her to shriek for mercy and to implore his forgiveness; but she\\nwas so pretty, so dainty and so fair, that he would suddenly take pity\\non her, as a child is moved to pity as he gazes at the bird he intended\\nto kill. And he would weep like a woman, man of bronze as he was, and\\nwould steal away so that she might not enjoy the triumph of seeing him\\nweep. In truth I know not which was the unhappier, he or she. She was\\ncruel from virtue, as he was kind from weakness; she had too much\\npatience, of which he had not enough; she had the failings of her good\\nqualities and he the good qualities of his failings.\\n\\nAround these two ill-assorted beings swarmed a multitude of friends who\\nstrove to bring them nearer together, some in order to have something to\\noccupy their minds, others to give themselves importance, others as the\\nresult of ill-advised affection. Some took the wife\\'s part, others the\\nhusband\\'s. They quarrelled among themselves on the subject of Monsieur\\nand Madame Delmare, who, on the other hand, did not quarrel at all; for,\\nwith Indiana\\'s systematic submission, the colonel could never succeed in\\npicking a quarrel, whatever he might do. And then there were those who\\nknew nothing, but wanted to make themselves necessary. They counselled\\nsubmission to Madame Delmare and did not see that she was only too\\nsubmissive; others advised the husband to be inflexible and not to allow\\nhis authority to pass into his wife\\'s hands. These last, stupid mortals\\nwho have so little feeling that they are always afraid that some one is\\ntreading on them and who mistake cause and effect for each other, belong\\nto a species which you will find everywhere, which is constantly getting\\nentangled in other people\\'s legs and makes a deal of noise in order to\\nattract attention.\\n\\nMonsieur and Madame Delmare had made a particularly large number of\\nacquaintances at Melun and at Fontainebleau. They met these people again\\nat Paris, and they were the keenest in the game of evil-speaking that\\nwas being played about them. The wit of small towns is, as you doubtless\\nknow, the most ill-natured in the world. Good people are always\\nmisunderstood there, superior minds are sworn foes of the public. If a\\nbattle is to be fought for a fool or a boor you will see them running\\nfrom all directions. If you have a dispute with any one, they come to\\nlook on as at the theatre; they make bets; they crowd upon your heels,\\nso eager are they to see and hear. The one who falls they will cover\\nwith mud and maledictions; the weakest is always in the wrong. If you\\nmake war on prejudices, petty foibles, vices, you insult them\\npersonally, you attack them in what they hold most dear, you are a\\ntreacherous and dangerous man. You will be summoned before the courts to\\nmake reparation by people whose names you do not know, but whom you will\\nbe convicted of having referred to in your slurring allusions. What\\nadvice shall I give you? If you meet one of these people, avoid stepping\\nin his shadow, even at sunset, when a man\\'s shadow is thirty feet long;\\nall that ground belongs to the inhabitant of the small town, and you\\nhave no right to set foot upon it. If you breathe the air that he\\nbreathes, you injure him, you destroy his health; if you drink at his\\nfountain, you cause it to run dry; if you lend a hand to business in his\\nprovince, you increase the price of the articles he purchases; if you\\noffer him snuff, you poison it; if you think his daughter pretty, you\\nintend to seduce her; if you extol his wife\\'s domestic virtues, it is\\ninsulting irony, and in your heart you despise her for her ignorance; if\\nyou are so ill-advised as to pay him a compliment in his own house, he\\nwill not understand it, and he will go about everywhere saying that you\\nhave insulted him. Take your penates and carry them into the woods or to\\nthe desolate moors. There only will the man of the small town leave you\\nin peace.\\n\\nEven behind the manifold girdle of the walls of Paris the small town\\npursued that ill-starred couple. Well-to-do families from Melun and\\nFontainebleau took up their abode in the capital for the winter and\\nbrought thither the blessing of their provincial manners. Cliques were\\nformed around Delmare and his wife, and all that was humanly possible\\nwas attempted in order to make their position with respect to each other\\nmore uncomfortable. Their unhappiness was increased thereby and their\\nmutual obstinacy did not diminish.\\n\\nRalph had the good sense not to meddle in their dissensions. Madame\\nDelmare had suspected him of embittering her husband against her, or at\\nleast of seeking to put an end to Raymon\\'s intimacy with her; but she\\nsoon realized the injustice of her suspicions. The colonel\\'s perfect\\ntranquillity with respect to Monsieur de Ramière was irrefutable\\nevidence of her cousin\\'s silence. Thereupon she felt that she must thank\\nhim; but he sedulously avoided any conversation on that subject;\\nwhenever she was alone with him, he eluded her hints and pretended not\\nto understand them. It was such a delicate subject that Madame Delmare\\nhad not the courage to force Ralph to discuss it; she simply endeavored,\\nby her loving attentions, by her delicate and affectionate deference to\\nhim, to make him understand her gratitude; but Ralph seemed to pay no\\nheed, and Indiana\\'s pride was wounded by this display of supercilious\\ngenerosity. She was afraid that she should seem to play the rôle of the\\nguilty wife imploring the indulgence of a stern witness; she became cold\\nand constrained once more with poor Ralph. It seemed to her that his\\nconduct in this matter was the natural consequence of his selfishness;\\nthat he loved her still, although he no longer esteemed her; that he\\nsimply desired her society for his own diversion, that he disliked to\\nabandon habits which she had formed for him in her home and to deprive\\nhimself of the attentions that she was never weary of bestowing upon\\nhim. She fancied that he was by no means anxious to invent grievances\\nagainst her husband or herself.\\n\\n\"That is just like his contempt for women,\" she thought; \"in his eyes\\nthey are simply domestic animals, useful to keep a house in order,\\nprepare meals and serve tea. He doesn\\'t do them the honor of entering\\ninto a discussion with them; their faults have no effect on him provided\\nthat they do not interfere with his comfort or with his mode of life.\\nRalph has no need of my heart; so long as my hands retain the knack of\\npreparing his pudding and of touching the strings of the harp for him,\\nwhat does he care for my love for another man, my secret suffering, my\\ndeathly impatience under the yoke which is crushing me? I am his\\nservant, he asks nothing more of me than that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX\\n\\n\\nIndiana had ceased to reproach Raymon; he defended himself so badly that\\nshe was afraid of finding him too worthy of blame. There was one thing\\nwhich she dreaded much more than being deceived, and that was being\\nabandoned. She could not live without her belief in him, without her\\nhope of the future he had promised her; for her life with Monsieur\\nDelmare and Ralph had become hateful to her, and if she had not expected\\nsoon to escape from the power of those two men, she would have drowned\\nherself at once. She often thought of it; she said to herself that if\\nRaymon treated her as he had treated Noun there would be no other way\\nfor her to avoid an unendurable future than to join Noun. That sombre\\nthought followed her everywhere and she took pleasure in it.\\n\\nMeanwhile the time fixed for their departure from France drew near. The\\ncolonel seemed to have no suspicion of the resistance which his wife was\\nmeditating; every day he made some progress in the settlement of his\\naffairs, every day he paid off one more creditor; and Madame Delmare\\nlooked on with a tranquil eye at all these preparations, sure as she was\\nof her own courage. She was preparing, too, for her struggle with the\\ndifficulties she anticipated. She sought to procure an ally in her aunt,\\nMadame de Carvajal, and dilated to her upon her repugnance to the\\njourney; and the old marchioness who--to give her no more than her\\ndue--built great hopes of attracting _custom_ to her salon upon her\\nniece\\'s beauty, declared that it was the colonel\\'s duty to leave his\\nwife in France; that it would be downright barbarity to expose her to\\nthe fatigues and dangers of an ocean voyage when her health had just\\nbegun to show some slight improvement; in a word, that it was his place\\nto go to work at rebuilding his fortune, Indiana\\'s to remain with her\\nold aunt and take care of her. At first Monsieur Delmare looked upon\\nthese insinuations as the doting talk of an old woman; but he was forced\\nto pay more attention to them when Madame de Carvajal gave him clearly\\nto understand that her inheritance was to be had only at that price.\\nAlthough Delmare loved money like a man who had worked hard all his life\\nto amass it, he had some pride in his composition; he pronounced his\\nultimatum with decision, and declared that his wife should go with him\\nat any risk. The marchioness, who could not believe that money was not\\nthe absolute sovereign of every man of good sense, did not look upon\\nthis as Monsieur Delmare\\'s last word; she continued to encourage her\\nniece in her resistance, proposing to assume the responsibility for her\\naction in the eyes of the world. It needed all the indelicacy of a mind\\ncorrupted by intrigue and ambition, all the shuffling of a heart\\ndistorted by constant devotion to mere external show, to close her eyes\\nthus to the real causes of Indiana\\'s rebellion. Her passion for Monsieur\\nde Ramière was a secret to no one but her husband; but as Indiana had\\nas yet given scandal nothing to seize upon, the secret was mentioned\\nonly in undertones, and Madame de Carvajal had been confidentially\\ninformed of it by more than a score of persons. The foolish old woman\\nwas flattered by it; all that she desired was to have her niece _à la\\nmode_ in society, and an intrigue with Raymon was a fine beginning. And\\nyet Madame de Carvajal\\'s moral character was not of the Regency type;\\nthe Restoration had given a virtuous impulse to minds of that stamp; and\\nas _conduct_ was demanded at court, the marchioness detested nothing so\\nmuch as the scandal that ruins and destroys. Under Madame du Barry she\\nwould have been less rigid in her principles; under the Dauphiness she\\nbecame one of the _high-necked._ But all this was for show, for the sake\\nof appearances; she kept her disapprobation and her scorn for notorious\\nmisconduct, and she always awaited the result of an intrigue before\\ncondemning it. Those infidelities which did not cross the threshold were\\nvenial in her eyes. She became a Spaniard once more to pass judgment on\\npassions inside the blinds; in her eyes there was no guilt save that\\nwhich was placarded in the streets for passers-by to see. So that\\nIndiana, passionate but chaste, enamored but reserved, was a precious\\nsubject to exhibit and exploit; such a woman as she was might fascinate\\nthe strongest brains in that hypocritical society and withstand the\\nperils of the most delicate missions. There was an excellent chance to\\nspeculate on the responsibility of so pure a mind and so passionate a\\nheart. Poor Indiana! luckily her fatal destiny surpassed all her hopes\\nand led her into an abyss of misery where her aunt\\'s pernicious\\nprotection did not seek her out.\\n\\nRaymon was not disturbed as to what was to become of her. This intrigue\\nhad already reached the last stage of distaste, deathly ennui, so far as\\nhe was concerned. To cause ennui is to descend as low as possible in the\\nregard of the person whom one loves. Luckily for the last days of her\\nillusion, Indiana had no suspicion of it.\\n\\nOne morning, on returning from a ball, he found Madame Delmare in his\\nroom. She had come at midnight; for five mortal hours she had been\\nwaiting! It was in the coldest part of the year; she had no fire, but\\nsat with her head resting on her hand, enduring cold and anxiety with\\nthe gloomy patience which the whole course of her life had taught her.\\nShe raised her head when he entered, and Raymon, speechless with\\namazement, could detect on her pale face no indication of anger or\\nreproach.\\n\\n\"I was waiting for you,\" she said gently; \"as you had not come to see me\\nfor three days, and as things have happened which it is important that\\nyou should know without delay, I came here last night in order to tell\\nyou of them.\"\\n\\n\"It is imprudent beyond belief!\" said Raymon, cautiously locking the\\ndoor behind him; \"and my people know that you are here! They just told\\nme so.\"\\n\\n\"I made no attempt at concealment,\" she replied coldly; \"and as for the\\nword you use, I consider it ill-chosen.\"\\n\\n\"I said imprudent, I should have said insane.\"\\n\\n\"And I should say _courageous._ But no matter; listen to me. Monsieur\\nDelmare starts for Bordeaux in three days, and sails thence for the\\ncolony. You and I agreed that you should protect me from violence if he\\nemployed it; there is no question that he will, for I made known my\\ndetermination last evening and he locked me into my room. I escaped\\nthrough a window; see, my hands are bleeding. They may be looking for me\\nat this moment, but Ralph is at Bellerive so that he will not be able to\\ntell where I am. I have decided to remain in hiding until Monsieur\\nDelmare has made up his mind to leave me behind. Have you thought about\\nmaking ready for my flight, of preparing a hiding-place for me? It is so\\nlong since I have been able to see you alone, that I do not know what\\nyour present inclinations are; but one day, when I expressed some doubt\\nconcerning your resolution, you told me that you could not imagine love\\nwithout confidence; you reminded me that you had never doubted me, you\\nproved to me that I was unjust, and thereupon I was afraid of remaining\\nbelow your level if I did not cast aside such puerile suspicions and the\\ninnumerable little exactions by which women degrade ordinary\\nlove-affairs. I have endured with resignation the brevity of your calls,\\nthe embarrassment of our interviews, the eagerness with which you seemed\\nto avoid any free exchange of sentiments with me; I have retained my\\nconfidence in you. Heaven is my witness that when anxiety and fear were\\ngnawing at my heart I spurned them as criminal thoughts. I have come now\\nto seek the reward of my faith; the time has come; tell me, do you\\naccept my sacrifices?\"\\n\\nThe crisis was so urgent that Raymon did not feel bold enough to pretend\\nany longer. Desperate, frantic to find himself caught in his own trap,\\nhe lost his head and vented his temper in coarse and brutal\\nmaledictions.\\n\\n\"You are a mad woman!\" he cried, throwing himself into a chair. \"Where\\nhave you dreamed of love? in what romance written for the entertainment\\nof lady\\'s-maids, have you studied society, I pray to know?\"\\n\\nHe paused, realizing that he had been far too rough, and cudgelling his\\nbrains to find a way of saying the same things in other terms and of\\nsending her away without insulting her.\\n\\nBut she was calm, like one prepared to listen to anything.\\n\\n\"Go on,\" she said, folding her arms over her heart, whose throbbing\\ngradually grew less violent; \"I am listening; I presume that you have\\nsomething more than that to say to me?\"\\n\\n\"Still another effort of the imagination, another love scene,\" thought\\nRaymon.--\"Never,\" he cried, springing excitedly to his feet, \"never will\\nI accept such sacrifices! When I told you that I should have the\\nstrength to do it, Indiana, I boasted too much, or rather I slandered\\nmyself; for the man is no better than a dastard who will consent to\\ndishonor the woman he loves. In your ignorance of life, you failed to\\nrealize the importance of such a plan, and I, in my despair at the\\nthought of losing you, did not choose to reflect----\"\\n\\n\"Your power of reflection has returned very suddenly!\" she said,\\nwithdrawing her hand, which he tried to take.\\n\\n\"Indiana,\" he rejoined, \"do you not see that you impose the dishonorable\\npart on me, while you reserve the heroic part for yourself, and that you\\ncondemn me because I desire to remain worthy of your love? Could you\\ncontinue to love me, ignorant and simple-hearted woman that you are, if\\nI sacrificed your life to my pleasure, your reputation to my selfish\\ninterests?\"\\n\\n\"You say things that are very contradictory,\" said Indiana; \"if I made\\nyou happy by remaining with you, what do you care for public opinion? Do\\nyou care more for it than for me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I do not care for it on my account, Indiana!\"\\n\\n\"Is it on my account then? I anticipated your scruples and to spare you\\nanything like remorse I have taken the initiative; I did not wait for\\nyou to come and carry me away from my home, I did not even consult you\\nwith regard to crossing my husband\\'s threshold forever. That decisive\\nstep is taken, and your conscience cannot reproach you for it. At this\\nmoment, Raymon, I am dishonored. In your absence I counted on yonder\\nclock the hours that consummated my disgrace; and now, although the dawn\\nfinds my brow as pure as it was yesterday, I am a lost creature in\\npublic opinion. Yesterday there was still some compassion for me in the\\nhearts of other women; to-day there will be no feeling left but\\ncontempt. I considered all these things before acting.\"\\n\\n\"Infernal female foresight!\" thought Raymon.\\n\\nAnd then, struggling against her as he would have done against a bailiff\\nwho had come to levy on his furniture, he said in a caressing fatherly\\ntone:\\n\\n\"You exaggerate the importance of what you have done. No, my love, all\\nis not lost because of one rash step. I will enjoin silence on my\\nservants.\"\\n\\n\"Will you enjoin silence on mine who, I doubt not, are anxiously looking\\nfor me at this moment. And my husband, do you think he will quietly keep\\nthe secret? do you think he will consent to receive me to-morrow, when I\\nhave passed a whole night under your roof? Will you advise me to go back\\nand throw myself at his feet, and ask him, as a proof of his\\nforgiveness, to be kind enough to replace on my neck the chain which has\\ncrushed my life and withered my youth? You would consent, without\\nregret, to see the woman whom you loved so dearly go back and resume\\nanother man\\'s yoke, when you have her fate in your hands, when you can\\nkeep her in your arms all your life, when she is in your power, offering\\nto remain there forever! You would not feel the least repugnance, the\\nleast alarm in surrendering her at once to the implacable master, who\\nperhaps awaits her coming only to kill her!\"\\n\\nA thought flashed through Raymon\\'s brain. The moment had come to subdue\\nthat womanly pride, or it would never come. She had offered him all the\\nsacrifices that he did not want, and she stood before him in overweening\\nconfidence that she ran no other risks than those she had foreseen.\\nRaymon conceived a scheme for ridding himself of her embarrassing\\ndevotion or of deriving some profit from it. He was too good a friend of\\nDelmare, he owed too much consideration to the man\\'s unbounded\\nconfidence to steal his wife from him; he must content himself with\\nseducing her.\\n\\n\"You are right, my Indiana,\" he cried with animation, \"you bring me back\\nto myself, you rekindle my transports which the thought of your danger\\nand the dread of injuring you had cooled. Forgive my childish solicitude\\nand let me prove to you how much of tenderness and genuine love it\\ndenotes. Your sweet voice makes my blood quiver, your burning words pour\\nfire into my veins; forgive, oh! forgive me for having thought of\\nanything else than this ineffable moment when I at last possess you. Let\\nme forget all the dangers that threaten us and thank you on my knees for\\nthe happiness you bring me; let me live entirely in this hour of bliss\\nwhich I pass at your feet and for which all my blood would not pay. Let\\nhim come, that dolt of a husband who locks you up and goes to sleep upon\\nhis vulgar brutality, let him come and snatch you from my transports!\\nlet him come and snatch you from my arms, my treasure, my life!\\nHenceforth you do not belong to him; you are my sweetheart, my\\ncompanion, my mistress----\"\\n\\nAs he pleaded thus, Raymon gradually worked himself up, as he was\\naccustomed to do when _arguing_ his passions. It was a powerful, a\\nromantic situation; it offered some risks. Raymon loved danger, like a\\ngenuine descendant of a race of valiant knights. Every sound that he\\nheard in the street seemed to denote the coming of the husband to claim\\nhis wife and his rival\\'s blood. To seek the joys of love in the stirring\\nemotions of such a situation was a diversion worthy of Raymon. For a\\nquarter of an hour he loved Madame Delmare passionately, he lavished\\nupon her the seductions of burning eloquence. He was truly powerful in\\nhis language and sincere in his behavior--this man whose ardent brain\\nconsidered love-making a polite accomplishment. He played at passion so\\nwell that he deceived himself. Shame upon that foolish woman! She\\nabandoned herself in ecstasy to those treacherous demonstrations; she\\nwas happy, she was radiant with hope and joy; she forgave everything,\\nshe almost accorded everything.\\n\\nBut Raymon ruined himself by over-precipitation. If he had carried his\\nart so far as to prolong for twenty-four hours the situation in which\\nIndiana had risked herself, she would perhaps have been his. But the day\\nwas breaking, bright and rosy; the sun poured floods of light into the\\nroom, and the noise in the street increased with every moment. Raymon\\ncast a glance at the clock; it was nearly seven.\\n\\n\"It is time to have done with it,\" he thought; \"Delmare may appear at\\nany moment, and before that happens I must induce her to return home\\nvoluntarily.\"\\n\\nHe became more urgent and less tender; the pallor of his lips betrayed\\nthe working of an impatience more imperious than delicate. There was in\\nhis kisses a sort of abruptness, almost anger. Indiana was afraid. A\\ngood angel spread its wings over that wavering and bewildered soul; she\\ncame to herself and repelled the attacks of cold and selfish vice.\\n\\n\"Leave me,\" she said; \"I do not propose to yield through weakness what I\\nam willing to accord for love or gratitude. You cannot need proofs of my\\naffection; my presence here is a sufficiently decisive one, and I bring\\nthe future with me. But allow me to keep all the strength of my\\nconscience to contend against the powerful obstacles that still separate\\nus; I need stoicism and tranquillity.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\" angrily demanded Raymon, who was furious\\nat her resistance and had not listened to her.\\n\\nAnd, losing his head altogether in that moment of torture and wrath, he\\npushed her roughly away and strode up and down the room, with heaving\\nbosom and head on fire; then he took a carafe and drank a large glass of\\nwater which suddenly calmed his excitement and cooled his love.\\nWhereupon he looked at her ironically and said:\\n\\n\"Come, madame, it is time for you to retire.\"\\n\\nA ray of light at last enlightened Indiana and laid Raymon\\'s heart bare\\nbefore her.\\n\\n\"You are right,\" she said.\\n\\nAnd she walked toward the door.\\n\\n\"Pray take your cloak and boa,\" he said, detaining her.\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" she retorted, \"those traces of my presence might\\ncompromise you.\"\\n\\n\"You are a child,\" he said, in a coaxing tone, as he adjusted her cloak\\nwith ostentatious care; \"you know very well that I love you; but really\\nyou take pleasure in torturing me, and you drive me mad. Wait until I go\\nand call a cab. If I could, I would escort you home; but that would ruin\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, do you not think that I am ruined already?\" she asked bitterly.\\n\\n\"No, my darling,\" replied Raymon, who asked nothing better than to\\npersuade her to leave him in peace. \"Nobody has noticed your absence, as\\nthey have not come here yet in search of you. Although I should be the\\nlast one to be suspected, it would be natural to inquire at the houses\\nof all of your acquaintances. And then you can go and place yourself\\nunder your aunt\\'s protection; indeed, that is the course I advise you to\\ntake; she will arrange everything. You will be supposed to have passed\\nthe night at her house.\"\\n\\nMadame Delmare was not listening; she was gazing stupidly at the sun, as\\nit rose, huge and red, over an expanse of gleaming roofs. Raymon tried\\nto rouse her from her preoccupation. She turned her eyes on him but\\nseemed not to recognize him. Her cheeks had a greenish tinge and her\\nparched lips seemed paralyzed.\\n\\nRaymon was terrified. He remembered the other\\'s suicide, and, in his\\nalarm, not knowing which way to turn, dreading lest he should become\\ntwice a criminal in his own eyes, but feeling too exhausted mentally to\\nbe able to deceive her again, he pushed her gently into an easy-chair,\\nlocked the door, and went up to his mother\\'s room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI\\n\\n\\nHe found her awake; she was accustomed to rise early, the result of\\nhabits of hard-working activity which she had formed during the\\nemigration, and which she had not abandoned when she recovered her\\nwealth.\\n\\nSeeing Raymon enter her room so late, pale and excited, and in full\\ndress, she realized that he was struggling in one of the frequent crises\\nof his stormy life. She had always been his refuge and salvation in\\nthese periods of agitation, of which no trace remained save a deep and\\nsorrowful one in her mother-heart. Her life had been withered and used\\nup by all that Raymon had acquired and reacquired. Her son\\'s character,\\nimpetuous yet cold, reflective yet passionate, was a consequence of her\\ninexhaustible love and generous indulgence. He would have been a better\\nman with a mother less kind; but she had accustomed him to make the most\\nof all the sacrifices that she consented to make for him; she had taught\\nhim to seek and to advance his own well-being as zealously and as\\npowerfully as she sought it. Because she deemed herself created to\\npreserve him from all sorrows and to sacrifice all her own interests to\\nhim, he had accustomed himself to believe that the whole world was\\ncreated for him and would place itself in his hand at a word from his\\nmother. By an abundance of generosity she had succeeded only in forming\\na selfish heart.\\n\\nShe turned pale, did the poor mother, and, sitting up in bed, gazed\\nanxiously at him. Her glance said at once: \"What can I do for you? Where\\nmust I go?\"\\n\\n\"Mother,\" he said, grasping the dry, transparent hand that she held out\\nto him, \"I am horribly unhappy, I need your help. Save me from the\\ntroubles by which I am surrounded. I love Madame Delmare, as you\\nknow----\"\\n\\n\"I did not know it,\" said Madame de Ramière, in a tone of affectionate\\nreproof.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t try to deny it, dear mother,\" said Raymon, who had no time to\\nwaste; \"you did know it, and your admirable delicacy prevented you\\nspeaking of it first. Well, that woman is driving me to despair, and my\\nbrain is going.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me what you mean!\" said Madame de Ramière, with the youthful\\nvivacity born of ardent maternal love.\\n\\n\"I do not mean to conceal anything from you, especially as I am not\\nguilty this time. For several months I have been trying to calm her\\nromantic brain and bring her back to a sense of her duties; but all my\\nefforts serve only to intensify this thirst for danger, this craving for\\nadventure that ferments in the brains of all the women of her country.\\nAt this moment she is here, in my room, against my will, and I cannot\\ninduce her to go away.\"\\n\\n\"Unhappy child!\" said Madame de Ramière, dressing herself in haste.\\n\"Such a timid, gentle creature! I will go and see her, talk to her! that\\nis what you came to ask me to do, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Raymon, moved involuntarily by his mother\\'s goodness of\\nheart; \"go and make her understand the language of reason and kindness.\\nShe will love virtue from your lips, I doubt not; perhaps she will give\\nway to your caresses; she will recover her self-control, poor creature!\\nshe suffers so keenly!\"\\n\\nRaymon threw himself into a chair and began to weep, the divers emotions\\nof the morning had so shaken his nerves. His mother wept with him and\\ncould not make up her mind to go down until she had forced him to take\\na few drops of ether.\\n\\nIndiana was not weeping and rose with a calm and dignified air when she\\nrecognized her. Madame de Ramière was so little prepared for such a\\ndignified and noble bearing, that she felt embarrassed before the\\nyounger woman, as if she had shown lack of consideration for her by\\ntaking her by surprise in her son\\'s bedroom. She yielded to the deep and\\ntrue emotion of her heart and opened her arms impulsively. Madame\\nDelmare threw herself into them; her despair found vent in bitter sobs\\nand the two women wept a long while on each other\\'s bosom.\\n\\nBut when Madame de Ramière would have spoken, Indiana checked her.\\n\\n\"Do not say anything to me, madame,\" she said, wiping away her tears;\\n\"you could find no words to say that would not cause me pain. Your\\ninterest and your kisses are enough to prove your generous affection; my\\nheart is as much relieved as it can be. I will go now; I do not need\\nyour urging to realize what I have to do.\"\\n\\n\"But I did not come to send you away, but to comfort you,\" said Madame\\nde Ramière.\\n\\n\"I cannot be comforted,\" she replied, kissing her once more; \"love me,\\nthat will help me a little; but do not speak to me. Adieu, madame; you\\nbelieve in God--pray for me.\"\\n\\n\"You shall not go alone!\" cried Madame de Ramière; \"I will myself go\\nwith you to your husband, to justify you, defend you and protect you.\"\\n\\n\"Generous woman!\" said Indiana, embracing her warmly, \"you cannot do it.\\nYou alone are ignorant of Raymon\\'s secret; all Paris will be talking\\nabout it to-night, and you would play an incongruous part in such a\\nstory. Let me bear the scandal of it alone; I shall not suffer long.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean? would you commit the crime of taking your own life?\\nDear child! you too believe in God, do you not?\"\\n\\n\"And so, madame, I start for Ile Bourbon in three days.\"\\n\\n\"Come to my arms, my darling child! come and let me bless you! God will\\nreward your courage.\"\\n\\n\"I trust so,\" said Indiana, looking up at the sky.\\n\\nMadame de Ramière insisted on sending for a carriage; but Indiana\\nresisted. She was resolved to return alone and without causing a\\nsensation. In vain did Raymon\\'s mother express her alarm at the idea of\\nher undertaking so long a journey on foot in her exhausted, agitated\\ncondition.\\n\\n\"I have strength enough,\" she said; \"a word from Raymon sufficed to give\\nme all I need.\"\\n\\nShe wrapped herself in her cloak, lowered her black lace veil and left\\nthe house by a secret door to which Madame de Ramière showed her the\\nway. As soon as she stepped into the street she felt as if her trembling\\nlegs would refuse to carry her; it seemed to her every moment that she\\ncould feel her furious husband\\'s brutal hand seize her, throw her down\\nand drag her in the gutter. Soon the noise in the street, the\\nindifference of the faces that passed her on every side and the\\npenetrating chill of the morning air restored her strength and\\ntranquillity, but it was a pitiable sort of strength and a tranquillity\\nas depressing as that which sometimes prevails on the ocean and alarms\\nthe far-sighted sailor more than the howling of the tempest. She walked\\nalong the quays from the Institute to the Corps Législatif; but she\\nforgot to cross the bridge and continued to wander by the river,\\nabsorbed in a bewildered reverie, in meditation without ideas, and\\nwalking aimlessly on and on.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration 04: _SIR RALPH SAVES INDIANA_\\n_In that moment of vertigo she leaned against a\\nwall and bent forward, fascinated, over what seemed\\nto her a solid mass. But the bark of a dog that was\\ncapering about her distracted her thoughts and delayed\\nfor some seconds the accomplishment of her\\ndesign. Meanwhile a man ran to the spot, guided\\nby the dog\\'s voice, seized her around the waist,\\ndragged her back and laid her on the ruins of an\\nabandoned boat on the shore._]\\n\\n\\nShe gradually drew nearer to the river, which washed pieces of ice\\nashore at her feet and shattered them on the stones along the shore with\\na dry sound that suggested cold. The greenish water exerted an\\nattractive force on Indiana\\'s senses. One becomes accustomed to horrible\\nideas; by dint of dwelling on them one takes pleasure in them. The\\nthought of Noun\\'s suicide had soothed her hours of despair for so many\\nmonths, that suicide had assumed in her mind the form of a tempting\\npleasure. A single thought, a religious thought, had prevented her from\\ndeciding definitely upon it; but at this moment no well-defined thought\\ncontrolled her exhausted brain. She hardly remembered that God existed,\\nthat Raymon ever existed, and she walked on, still drawing nearer the\\nbank, obeying the instinct of unhappiness and the magnetic force of\\nsuffering.\\n\\nWhen she felt the stinging cold of the water on her feet, she woke as if\\nfrom a fit of somnambulism, and on looking about to discover where she\\nwas, saw Paris behind her and the Seine rushing by at her feet, bearing\\nin its oily depths the white reflection of the houses and the grayish\\nblue of the sky. This constant movement of the water and the immobility\\nof the ground became confused in her bewildered mind, and it seemed to\\nher that the water was sleeping and the ground moving. In that moment of\\nvertigo she leaned against a wall and bent forward, fascinated, over\\nwhat seemed to her a solid mass. But the bark of a dog that was capering\\nabout her distracted her thoughts and delayed for some seconds the\\naccomplishment of her design. Meanwhile a man ran to the spot, guided by\\nthe dog\\'s voice, seized her around the waist, dragged her back and laid\\nher on the ruins of an abandoned boat on the shore. She looked in his\\nface and did not recognize him. He knelt at her foot, unfastened his\\ncloak and wrapped it about her, took her hands in his to warm them and\\ncalled her by name. But her brain was too weak to make an effort; for\\nforty-eight hours she had forgotten to eat.\\n\\nHowever, when the blood began to circulate in her benumbed limbs, she\\nsaw Ralph kneeling beside her, holding her hands and watching for the\\nreturn of consciousness.\\n\\n\"Did you meet Noun?\" she asked him. \"I saw her pass along there,\" she\\nadded, pointing to the river, distracted by her fixed idea. \"I tried to\\nfollow her, but she walked too fast, and I am not strong enough to walk.\\nIt was like a nightmare.\"\\n\\nRalph looked at her in sore distress. He too felt as if his head were\\nbursting and his brain running wild.\\n\\n\"Let us go,\" she continued; \"but first see if you can find my feet; I\\nlost them on the stones.\"\\n\\nRalph saw that her feet were wet and paralyzed by cold. He carried her\\nin his arms to a house near by, where the kindly care of a hospitable\\nwoman restored her to consciousness. Meanwhile Ralph sent word to\\nMonsieur Delmare that his wife was found; but the colonel had not\\nreturned home when the news arrived. He was continuing his search in a\\nfrenzy of anxiety and wrath. Ralph, being more perspicacious, had gone\\nto Monsieur de Ramière\\'s, but he had found Raymon, who had just gone to\\nbed and who was very cool and ironical in his reception of him. Then he\\nhad thought of Noun and had followed the river in one direction, while\\nhis servant did the same in the other direction. Ophelia had speedily\\nfound her mistress\\'s scent and had led Ralph to the place where he found\\nher.\\n\\nWhen Indiana was able to recall what had taken place during that\\nwretched night, she tried in vain to remember the occurrences of her\\nmoments of delirium. She was unable therefore to explain to her cousin\\nwhat thoughts had guided her action during the last hour; but he divined\\nthem and understood the state of her heart without questioning her. He\\nsimply took her hand and said to her in a gentle but grave tone:\\n\\n\"Cousin, I require one promise from you; it is the last proof of\\nfriendship which I shall ever ask at your hands.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me what it is,\" she replied; \"to oblige you is the only pleasure\\nthat is left to me.\"\\n\\n\"Well then,\" rejoined Ralph, \"swear to me that you will not resort to\\nsuicide without notifying me. I swear to you on my honor that I will not\\noppose your design in any way. I simply insist on being notified: as for\\nlife, I care about it as little as you do, and you know that I have\\noften had the same idea.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you talk of suicide?\" said Madame Delmare. \"I have never\\nintended to take my own life. I am afraid of God; if it weren\\'t for\\nthat!----\"\\n\\n\"Just now, Indiana, when I seized you in my arms, when this poor\\nbeast\"--and he patted Ophelia--\"caught your dress, you had forgotten God\\nand the whole universe, poor Ralph with the rest.\"\\n\\nA tear stood in Indiana\\'s eye. She pressed Sir Ralph\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Why did you stop me?\" she said sadly; \"I should be on God\\'s bosom now,\\nfor I was not guilty, I did not know what I was doing.\"\\n\\n\"I saw that, and I thought that it was better to commit suicide after\\ndue reflection. We will talk about it again if you choose.\"\\n\\nIndiana shuddered. The cab stopped in front of the house where she was\\nto confront her husband. She had not the strength to mount the steps and\\nRalph carried her to her room. Their whole retinue was reduced to a\\nsingle maid servant, who had gone to discuss Madame Delmare\\'s flight\\nwith the neighbors, and Lelièvre, who, in despair, had gone to the\\nmorgue to inspect the bodies brought in that morning. So Ralph remained\\nwith Madame Delmare to nurse her. She was suffering intensely when a\\nloud peal of the bell announced the colonel\\'s return. A shudder of\\nterror and hatred ran through her every vein. She seized her cousin\\'s\\narm.\\n\\n\"Listen, Ralph,\" she said; \"if you have the slightest affection for me,\\nyou will spare me the sight of that man in my present condition. I do\\nnot want to arouse his pity, I prefer his anger to that. Do not open the\\ndoor, or else send him away; tell him that I haven\\'t been found.\"\\n\\nHer lips quivered, her arms clung to Ralph with convulsive strength, to\\ndetain him. Torn by two conflicting feelings, the poor baronet could not\\nmake up his mind what to do. Delmare was jangling the bell as if he\\nwould break it, and his wife was almost dying in his chair.\\n\\n\"You think only of his anger,\" said Ralph at last; \"you do not think of\\nhis misery, his anxiety; you still believe that he hates you. If you had\\nseen his grief this morning!\"\\n\\nIndiana dropped her arms, thoroughly exhausted, and Ralph went and\\nopened the door.\\n\\n\"Is she here?\" cried the colonel, rushing in. \"Ten thousand devils! I\\nhave run about enough after her; I am deeply obliged to her for putting\\nsuch a pleasant duty on me! Deuce take her! I don\\'t want to see her, for\\nI should kill her!\"\\n\\n\"You forget that she can hear you,\" replied Ralph in an undertone. \"She\\nis in no condition to bear any painful excitement. Be calm.\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-five thousand maledictions!\" roared the colonel. \"I have endured\\nenough myself since this morning. It\\'s a good thing for me that my\\nnerves are like cables. Which of us is the more injured, the more\\nexhausted, which of us has the better right to be sick, I pray to\\nknow,--she or I? And where did you find her? what was she doing? She is\\nresponsible for my having outrageously insulted that foolish old woman,\\nCarvajal, who gave me ambiguous answers and blamed me for this charming\\nfreak! Damnation! I am dead beat!\"\\n\\nAs he spoke thus in his harsh, hoarse voice, Delmare had thrown himself\\non a chair in the ante-room; he wiped his brow from which the\\nperspiration was streaming despite the intense cold; he described with\\nmany oaths his fatigues, his anxieties, his sufferings; he asked a\\nthousand questions, and, luckily, did not listen to the answers, for\\npoor Ralph could not lie, and he could think of nothing in what he had\\nto tell that was likely to appease the colonel. So he sat on a table, as\\nsilent and unmoved as if he were absolutely without interest in the\\nsufferings of those two, and yet he was really more unhappy in their\\nunhappiness than they themselves were.\\n\\nMadame Delmare, when she heard her husband\\'s imprecations, felt stronger\\nthan she expected. She preferred this fierce wrath, which reconciled her\\nwith herself, to a generous forbearance which would have aroused her\\nremorse. She wiped away the last trace of her tears and summoned what\\nremained of her strength, which she was well content to expend in a day,\\nso heavy a burden had life become to her. Her husband accosted her in a\\nharsh and imperious tone, but suddenly changed his expression and his\\nmanner and seemed sorely embarrassed, overmatched by the superiority of\\nher character. He tried to be as cool and dignified as she was; but he\\ncould not succeed.\\n\\n\"Will you condescend to inform me, madame,\" he said, \"where you passed\\nthe morning and perhaps the night?\"\\n\\nThat _perhaps_ indicated to Madame Delmare that her absence had not been\\ndiscovered until late. Her courage increased with that knowledge.\\n\\n\"No, monsieur,\" she replied, \"I do not propose to tell you.\"\\n\\nDelmare turned green with anger and amazement.\\n\\n\"Do you really hope to conceal the truth from me?\" he said, in a\\ntrembling voice.\\n\\n\"I care very little about it,\" she replied in an icy tone. \"I refuse to\\ntell you solely for form\\'s sake. I propose to convince you that you have\\nno right to ask me that question?\"\\n\\n\"I have no right, ten thousand devils. Who is master here, pray tell,\\nyou or I? Which of us wears a petticoat and ought to be running a\\ndistaff? Do you propose to take the beard off my chin? It would look\\nwell on you, hussy!\"\\n\\n\"I know that I am the slave and you the master. The laws of this country\\nmake you my master. You can bind my body, tie my hands, govern my acts.\\nYou have the right of the stronger, and society confirms you in it; but\\nyou cannot command my will, monsieur; God alone can bend it and subdue\\nit. Try to find a law, a dungeon, an instrument of torture that gives\\nyou any hold on it! you might as well try to handle the air and grasp\\nspace.\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue, you foolish, impertinent creature; your high-flown\\nnovelist\\'s phrases weary me.\"\\n\\n\"You can impose silence on me, but not prevent me from thinking.\"\\n\\n\"Silly pride! pride of a poor worm! you abuse the compassion I have had\\nfor you! But you will soon see that this mighty will can be subdued\\nwithout too much difficulty.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t advise you to try it; your repose would suffer, and you would\\ngain nothing in dignity.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" he said, crushing her hand between his thumb and\\nforefinger.\\n\\n\"I do think so,\" she said, without wincing.\\n\\nRalph stepped forward, grasped the colonel\\'s arm in his iron hand and\\nbent it like a reed, saying in a pacific tone:\\n\\n\"I beg that you will not touch a hair of that woman\\'s head.\"\\n\\nDelmare longed to fly at him; but he felt that he was in the wrong and\\nhe dreaded nothing in the world so much as having to blush for himself.\\nSo he simply pushed him away, saying:\\n\\n\"Attend to your own business.\"\\n\\nThen he returned to his wife.\\n\\n\"So, madame,\" he said, holding his arms tightly against his sides to\\nresist the temptation to strike her, \"you rebel against me, you refuse\\nto go to Ile Bourbon with me, you desire a separation? Very well!\\n_Mordieu!_ I too----\"\\n\\n\"I desire it no longer,\" she replied. \"I did desire it yesterday, it was\\nmy will; it is not so this morning. You resorted to violence and locked\\nme in my room; I went out through the window to show you that there is a\\ndifference between exerting an absurd control over a woman\\'s actions and\\nreigning over her will. I passed several hours away from your\\ndomination; I breathed the air of liberty in order to show you that you\\nare not morally my master, and that I look to no one on earth but myself\\nfor orders. As I walked along I reflected that I owed it to my duty and\\nmy conscience to return and place myself under your control once more. I\\ndid it of my own free will. My cousin _accompanied_ me here, he did not\\n_bring me back_. If I had not chosen to come with him, he could not have\\nforced me to do it, as you can imagine. So, monsieur, do not waste your\\ntime fighting against my determination; you will never control it, you\\nlost all right to change it as soon as you undertook to assert your\\nright by force. Make your preparations for departure; I am ready to\\nassist you and to accompany you, not because it is your will, but\\nbecause it is my pleasure. You may condemn me, but I will never obey\\nanyone but myself.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for the derangement of your mind,\" said the colonel,\\nshrugging his shoulders.\\n\\nAnd he went to his room to put his papers in order, well satisfied in\\nhis heart with Madame Delmare\\'s resolution and anticipating no further\\nobstacles; for he respected her word as much as he despised her ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII\\n\\n\\nRaymon, yielding to fatigue, slept soundly after his curt reception of\\nSir Ralph, who came to his house to make inquiries. When he awoke, his\\nheart was full of a feeling of intense relief; he believed that the\\nworst crisis of his intrigue had finally come and gone. For a long time\\nhe had foreseen that there would come a time when he would be brought\\nface to face with that woman\\'s love and would have to defend his liberty\\nagainst the exacting demands of a romantic passion; and he encouraged\\nhimself in advance by arguing against such pretensions. He had at last\\nreached and crossed that dangerous spot: he had said no, he would have\\nno occasion to go there again, for everything had happened for the best.\\nIndiana had not wept overmuch, had not been too insistent. She had been\\nquite reasonable; she had understood at the first word and had made up\\nher mind quickly and proudly.\\n\\nRaymon was very well pleased with his providence; for he had one of his\\nown, in whom he believed like a good son, and upon whom he relied to\\narrange everything to other people\\'s detriment rather than his own. That\\nprovidence had treated him so well thus far that he did not choose to\\ndoubt it. To anticipate the result of his wrong-doing and to be anxious\\nconcerning it would have been in his eyes a crime against the good Lord\\nwho watched over him.\\n\\nHe rose, still very much fatigued by the efforts of the imagination\\nwhich the circumstances of that painful scene had compelled him to make.\\nHis mother returned; she had been to Madame de Carvajal to inquire as to\\nMadame Delmare\\'s health and frame of mind. The marchioness was not\\ndisturbed about her; she was, however, very much disgusted when Madame\\nde Ramière shrewdly questioned her. But the only thing that impressed\\nher in Madame Delmare\\'s disappearance was the scandal that would result\\nfrom it. She complained very bitterly of her niece, whom, only the day\\nbefore, she had extolled to the skies; and Madame de Ramière understood\\nthat the unfortunate Indiana had, by this performance, alienated her\\nkinswoman and lost the only natural prop that she still possessed.\\n\\nTo one who could read in the depths of the marchioness\\'s soul, this\\nwould have seemed no great loss; but Madame de Carvajal was esteemed\\nvirtuous beyond reproach, even by Madame de Ramière. Her youth had been\\nenveloped in the mysteries of prudence, or lost in the whirlwind of\\nrevolutions.\\n\\nRaymon\\'s mother wept over Indiana\\'s lot and tried to excuse her; Madame\\nde Carvajal tartly reminded her that she was not sufficiently\\ndisinterested in the matter to judge.\\n\\n\"But what will become of the unhappy creature?\" said Madame de Ramière.\\n\"If her husband maltreats her, who will protect her?\"\\n\\n\"That will be as God wills,\" replied the marchioness; \"for my part, I\\'ll\\nhave nothing more to do with her and I never wish to see her again.\"\\n\\nMadame de Ramière, kind-hearted and anxious, determined to obtain news\\nof Madame Delmare at any price. She bade her coachman drive to the end\\nof the street on which she lived and sent a footman to question the\\nconcierge, instructing him to try to see Sir Ralph if he were in the\\nhouse. She awaited in her carriage the result of this manœuvre, and\\nRalph himself soon joined her there.\\n\\nThe only person, perhaps, who judged Ralph accurately was Madame de\\nRamière; a few words sufficed to make each of them understand the\\nother\\'s sincere and unselfish interest in the matter. Ralph narrated\\nwhat had passed during the morning; and, as he had nothing more than\\nsuspicions concerning the events of the night, he did not seek\\nconfirmation of them. But Madame de Ramière deemed it her duty to\\ninform him of what she knew, imparting to him her desire to break off\\nthis ill-omened and impossible liaison. Ralph, who felt more at ease\\nwith her than with anybody else, allowed the profound emotion which her\\ninformation caused him to appear on his face.\\n\\n\"You say, madame,\" he murmured, repressing a sort of nervous shudder\\nthat ran through his veins, \"that she passed the night in your house?\"\\n\\n\"A solitary and sorrowful night, no doubt. Raymon, who certainly was not\\nguilty of complicity, did not come home until six o\\'clock, and at seven\\nhe came up to me to ask me to go down and soothe the poor child\\'s mind.\"\\n\\n\"She meant to leave her husband! she meant to destroy her good name!\"\\nrejoined Ralph, his eyes fixed on vacancy and a strange oppression at\\nhis heart. \"Then she must love this man, who is so unworthy of her, very\\ndearly!\"\\n\\nRalph forgot that he was talking to Raymon\\'s mother.\\n\\n\"I have suspected this a long while,\" he continued; \"why could I not\\nhave foretold the day on which she would consummate her ruin! I would\\nhave killed her first!\"\\n\\nSuch language in Ralph\\'s mouth surprised Madame de Ramière beyond\\nmeasure; she supposed that she was speaking to a calm, indulgent man,\\nand she regretted that she had trusted to appearances.\\n\\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" she said in dismay, \"do you judge her without mercy? will\\nyou abandon her as her aunt has? Are you incapable of pity or\\nforgiveness? Will she not have a single friend left after a fault which\\nhas already caused her such bitter suffering?\"\\n\\n\"Have no fear of anything of the sort on my part, madame,\" Ralph\\nreplied; \"I have known all for six months and I have said nothing. I\\nsurprised their first kiss and I did not hurl Monsieur de Ramière from\\nhis horse; I often intercepted their love messages in the woods and did\\nnot tear them in pieces with my whip. I met Monsieur de Ramière on the\\nbridge he must cross to go to join her; it was night, we were alone and\\nI am four times as strong as he; and yet I did not throw the man into\\nthe river; and when, after allowing him to escape, I discovered that he\\nhad eluded my vigilance and had stolen into her house, instead of\\nbursting in the doors and throwing him out of the window, I quietly\\nwarned them of the husband\\'s approach and saved the life of one in order\\nto save the other\\'s honor. You see, madame, that I am indulgent and\\nmerciful. This morning I had that man under my hand; I was well aware\\nthat he was the cause of all our misery, and, if I had not the right to\\naccuse him without proofs, I certainly should have been justified in\\nquarreling with him for his arrogant and mocking manner. But I bore with\\nhis insulting contempt because I knew that his death would kill Indiana;\\nI allowed him to turn over and fall asleep again on the other side,\\nwhile Indiana, insane and almost dead, was on the shore of the Seine,\\npreparing to join his other victim. You see, madame, that I practise\\npatience with those whom I hate and indulgence with those I love.\"\\n\\nMadame de Ramière, sitting in her carriage opposite Ralph, gazed at him\\nin surprise mingled with alarm. He was so different from what she had\\nalways seen him that she almost believed that he had suddenly become\\nderanged. The allusion he had just made to Noun\\'s death confirmed her in\\nthat idea; for she knew absolutely nothing of that story and took the\\nwords that Ralph had let fall in his indignation for a fragment of\\nthought unconnected with his subject. He was, in very truth, passing\\nthrough one of those periods of intense excitement which occur at least\\nonce in the lives of the most placid men, and which border so closely on\\nmadness that one step farther would carry them across the line. His\\nwrath was restrained and concentrated like that of all cold\\ntemperaments; but it was deep, like the wrath of all noble souls; and\\nthe novelty of this frame of mind, which was truly portentous in him,\\nmade him terrible to look upon.\\n\\nMadame de Ramière took his hand and said gently:\\n\\n\"You must suffer terribly, my dear Monsieur Ralph, for you wound me\\nwithout mercy: you forget that the man of whom you speak is my son and\\nthat his wrong-doing, if he has been guilty of any, must be infinitely\\nmore painful to me than to you.\"\\n\\nRalph at once came to himself, and said, kissing Madame de Ramière\\'s\\nhand with an effusive warmth of regard, which was almost as unusual a\\nmanifestation on his part as that of his wrath:\\n\\n\"Forgive me, madame; you are right, I do suffer terribly, and I forget\\nthose things which I should respect. Pray, forget yourself the\\nbitterness I have allowed to appear! my heart will not fail to lock\\nitself up again.\"\\n\\nMadame de Ramière, although somewhat reassured by this reply, could not\\nrid herself of all anxiety when she saw with what profound hatred Ralph\\nregarded her son. She tried to excuse him in his enemy\\'s eyes, but he\\nchecked her.\\n\\n\"I divine your thoughts, madame,\" he said; \"but have no fear, Monsieur\\nde Ramière and I are not likely to meet again at present. As for my\\ncousin, do not regret having enlightened me. If the whole world abandons\\nher, I swear that she will always have at least one friend.\"\\n\\nWhen Madame de Ramière returned home, toward evening, she found Raymon\\nluxuriously ensconced in front of the fire, warming his slippered feet\\nand drinking tea to banish the last vestiges of the nervous excitement\\nof the morning. He was still cast down by that artificial emotion; but\\npleasant thoughts of the future revivified his faculties; he felt that\\nhe had become free once more, and he abandoned himself unreservedly to\\nblissful meditations upon that priceless condition, which he had\\nhitherto been so unsuccessful in maintaining.\\n\\n\"Why am I destined,\" he said to himself, \"to weary so quickly of this\\npriceless freedom of the heart which I always have to buy so dearly?\\nWhen I feel that I am caught in a woman\\'s net, I cannot break it quickly\\nenough, in order to recover my repose and mental tranquillity. May I be\\ncursed if I sacrifice them in such a hurry again! The trouble these two\\ncreoles have caused me will serve as a warning, and hereafter I do not\\npropose to meddle with any but easy-going, laughing Parisian\\nwomen--genuine women of the world. Perhaps I should do well to marry and\\nhave done with it, as they say----\"\\n\\nHe was absorbed by such comforting, commonplace thoughts as these, when\\nhis mother entered, tired and deeply moved.\\n\\n\"She is better,\" she said; \"everything has gone off as well as possible;\\nI hope that she will grow calmer and----\"\\n\\n\"Who?\" inquired Raymon, waking with a start among his castles in Spain.\\n\\nHowever, he concluded on the following day that he still had a duty to\\nperform, namely, to regain that woman\\'s esteem, if not her love. He did\\nnot choose that she should boast of having left him; he proposed that\\nshe should be persuaded that she had yielded to the influence of his\\ngood sense and his generosity. He desired to govern her even after he\\nhad spurned her; and he wrote to her as follows:\\n\\n\"I do not write to ask your pardon, my dear, for a few cruel or\\naudacious words that escaped me in the delirium of my passion. In the\\nderangement of fever no man can form perfectly coherent ideas or express\\nhimself in a proper manner. It is not my fault that I am not a god, that\\nI cannot control in your presence the turbulent ardor of my blood, that\\nmy brain whirls, that I go mad. Perhaps I may have a right to complain\\nof the merciless _sang-froid_ with which you condemned me to frightful\\ntorture and never took pity on me; but that was not your fault. You are\\ntoo perfect to play the same rôle in this world that we common mortals\\nplay, subject as we are to human passions, slaves of our less-refined\\norganization. As I have often told you, Indiana, you are not a woman,\\nand, when I think of you tranquilly and without excitement, you are an\\nangel. I adore you in my heart as a divinity. But alas! in your presence\\nthe _old Adam_ has often reasserted his rights. Often, under the\\nperfumed breath from your lips, a scorching flame has consumed mine;\\noften when, as I leaned toward you, my hair has brushed against yours, a\\nthrill of indescribable bliss has run through my veins, and thereupon I\\nhave forgotten that you were an emanation from Heaven, a dream of\\neverlasting felicity, an angel sent from God\\'s bosom to guide my steps\\nin this life and to describe to me the joys of another existence. Why, O\\nchaste spirit, did you assume the alluring form of a woman? Why, O angel\\nof light, did you clothe yourself in the seductions of hell? Often have\\nI thought that I held happiness in my arms, and it was only virtue.\\n\\n\"Forgive me these reprehensible regrets, my love; I was not worthy of\\nyou, but perhaps we should both have been happier if you would have\\nconsented to stoop to my level. But my inferiority has constantly caused\\nyou pain and you have imputed your own virtues to me as crimes.\\n\\n\"Now that you absolve me--as I am sure that you do, for perfection\\nimplies mercy--let me still raise my voice to thank you and bless you.\\nThank you, do I say? Ah! no, my life, that is not the word; for my heart\\nis more torn than yours by the courage that snatches you from my arms.\\nBut I admire you; and, through my tears, I congratulate you. Yes, my\\nIndiana, you have mustered strength to accomplish this heroic sacrifice.\\nIt tears out my heart and my life; it renders my future desolate, it\\nruins my existence. But I love you well enough to endure it without a\\ncomplaint; for my honor is nothing, yours is all in all. I would\\nsacrifice my honor to you a thousand times; but yours is dearer to me\\nthan all the joys you have given me. No, no! I could not have enjoyed\\nsuch a sacrifice. In vain should I have tried to blunt my conscience by\\ndelirious transports; in vain would you have opened your arms to\\nintoxicate me with celestial joys--remorse would have found me out; it\\nwould have poisoned every hour of my life, and I should have been more\\nhumiliated than you by the contempt of men. O God! to see you degraded\\nand brought to shame by me! to see you deprived of the veneration which\\nencompassed you! to see you insulted in my arms and to be unable to wipe\\nout the insult! for, though I should have shed all my blood for you, it\\nwould not have availed you. I might have avenged you, perhaps, but could\\nnever have justified you. My zeal in your defence would have been an\\nadditional accusation against you; my death an unquestionable proof of\\nyour crime. Poor Indiana! I should have ruined you! Ah! how miserably\\nunhappy I should be!\\n\\n\"Go, therefore, my beloved; go and reap under another sky the fruits of\\nvirtue and religion. God will reward us for such an effort, for God is\\ngood. He will reunite us in a happier life, and perhaps--but the mere\\nthought is a crime; and yet I cannot refrain from hoping! Adieu,\\nIndiana, adieu! You see that our love is a sin! Alas! my heart is\\nbroken. Where could I find strength to say adieu to you!\"\\n\\nRaymon himself carried this letter to Madame Delmare\\'s; but she shut\\nherself up in her room and refused to see him. So he left the house\\nafter handing the letter secretly to the servant and cordially embracing\\nthe husband. As he left the last step behind him, he felt much\\nbetter-hearted than usual; the weather was finer, the women fairer, the\\nshops more brilliant. It was a red-letter day in Raymon\\'s life.\\n\\nMadame Delmare placed the letter, with the seal unbroken, in a box which\\nshe did not propose to open until she reached her destination. She\\nwished to go to take leave of her aunt, but Sir Ralph with downright\\nobstinacy opposed her doing so. He had seen Madame de Carvajal; he knew\\nthat she would overwhelm Indiana with reproaches and scorn; he was\\nindignant at this hypocritical severity, and could not endure the\\nthought of Madame Delmare exposing herself to it.\\n\\nOn the following day, as Delmare and his wife were about entering the\\ndiligence, Sir Ralph said to them with his accustomed _sang-froid_:\\n\\n\"I have often given you to understand, my friends, that it was my wish\\nto accompany you; but you have refused to understand, or, at all events,\\nto give me an answer. Will you allow me to go with you?\"\\n\\n\"To Bordeaux?\" queried Monsieur Delmare.\\n\\n\"To Bourbon,\" replied Sir Ralph.\\n\\n\"You cannot think of it,\" rejoined Monsieur Delmare; \"you cannot shift\\nyour establishment about from place to place at the caprice of a couple\\nwhose situation is precarious and whose future is uncertain. It would be\\nabusing your friendship shamefully to accept the sacrifice of your whole\\nlife and of your position in society. You are rich and young and free;\\nyou ought to marry again, found a family--\"\\n\\n\"That is not the question,\" said Sir Ralph, coldly. \"As I have not the\\nart of enveloping my ideas in words which change their meaning, I will\\ntell you frankly what I think. It has seemed to me that in the last six\\nmonths our friendship has fallen off perceptibly. Perhaps I have made\\nmistakes which my dulness of perception has prevented me from detecting.\\nIf I am wrong, a word from you will suffice to set my mind at rest;\\nallow me to go with you. If I have deserved severe treatment at your\\nhands, it is time to tell me so; you ought not, by abandoning me thus,\\nto leave me to suffer remorse for having failed to make reparation for\\nmy faults.\"\\n\\nThe colonel was so touched by this artless and generous appeal that he\\nforgot all the wounds to his self-esteem which had alienated him from\\nhis friend. He offered him his hand, swore that his friendship was more\\nsincere than ever, and that he refused his offers only from delicacy.\\n\\nMadame Delmare held her peace. Ralph made an effort to obtain a word\\nfrom her.\\n\\n\"And you, Indiana,\" he said in a stifled voice, \"have you still a\\nfriendly feeling for me?\"\\n\\nThat question reawoke all the filial affection, all the memories of\\nchildhood, of years of intimacy, which bound their hearts together. They\\nthrew themselves weeping into each other\\'s arms, and Ralph nearly\\nswooned; for strong emotions were constantly fermenting in that robust\\nbody, beneath that calm and reserved exterior. He sat down to avoid\\nfalling and remained for a few moments without speaking, pale as death;\\nthen he seized the colonel\\'s hand in one of his and his wife\\'s in the\\nother.\\n\\n\"At this moment, when we are about to part, perhaps forever, be frank\\nwith me. You refuse my proposal to accompany you on my account and not\\non your own?\"\\n\\n\"I give you my word of honor,\" said Delmare, \"that in refusing you I\\nsacrifice my happiness to yours.\"\\n\\n\"For my part,\" said Indiana, \"you know that I would like never to leave\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid that I should doubt your sincerity at such a moment!\"\\nrejoined Ralph; \"your word is enough for me; I am content with you\\nboth.\"\\n\\nAnd he disappeared.\\n\\nSix weeks later the brig _Coraly_ sailed from the port of Bordeaux.\\nRalph had written to his friends that he would be in that city just\\nprior to their sailing; but, as his custom was, in such a laconic style\\nthat it was impossible to determine whether he intended to bid them\\nadieu for the last time or to accompany them. They waited in vain for\\nhim until the last moment, and when the captain gave the signal to weigh\\nanchor he had not appeared. Gloomy presentiments added their bitterness\\nto the dull pain that gnawed at Indiana\\'s heart, when the last houses of\\nthe town vanished amid the trees on the shore. She shuddered at the\\nthought that she was thenceforth alone in the world with the husband\\nwhom she hated! that she must live and die with him, without a friend to\\ncomfort her, without a kinsman to protect her against his brutal\\ndomination.\\n\\nBut, as she turned, she saw on the deck behind her Ralph\\'s placid and\\nkindly face smiling into hers.\\n\\n\"So you have not abandoned me after all?\" she said, as she threw her\\narms about his neck, her face bathed in tears.\\n\\n\"Never!\" replied Ralph, straining her to his heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII\\n\\n\\nLETTER FROM MADAME DELMARE TO MONSIEUR\\nDE RAMIÈRE\\n\\n\"Ile Bourbon, June 3d, 18--\\n\\n\\n\"I had determined to weary you no more with reminders of me; but, after\\nreading on my arrival here the letter you sent me just before I left\\nParis, I feel that I owe you a reply because, in the agitation caused by\\nhorrible suffering, I went too far. I was mistaken with regard to you,\\nand I owe you an apology, not as a _lover_ but as a _man._\\n\\n\"Forgive me, Raymon, for in the most ghastly moment of my life I took\\nyou for a monster. A single word, a single glance from you banished all\\nconfidence and all hope from my heart forever. I know that I can never\\nbe happy again; but I still hope that I may not be driven to despise\\nyou; that would be the last blow.\\n\\n\"Yes, I took you for a dastard, for the worst of all human creatures, an\\n_egotist._ I conceived a horror of you. I regretted that Bourbon was not\\nso far away as I longed to fly from you, and indignation gave me\\nstrength to drain the cup to the dregs.\\n\\n\"But since I have read your letter I feel better. I do not regret you,\\nbut I no longer hate you, and I do not wish to leave your life a prey to\\nremorse for having ruined mine. Be happy, be free from care; forget me.\\nI am still alive and I may live a long while.\\n\\nIt is a fact that you are not to blame; I was the one who was mad. Your\\nheart was not dry, but it was closed to me. You did not lie to me, but I\\ndeceived myself. You were neither perjured nor cold; you simply did not\\nlove me.\\n\\n\"Oh! _mon Dieu!_ you did not love me! In heaven\\'s name how must you be\\nloved? But I will not stoop to complaints; I am not writing to you for\\nthe purpose of poisoning with hateful memories the repose of your\\npresent life; nor do I propose to implore your compassion for sorrows\\nwhich I am strong enough to bear alone. On the contrary, knowing better\\nthe rôle for which you are suited, I absolve you and forgive you.\\n\\n\"I will not amuse myself by refuting the charges in your letter; it\\nwould be too easy a matter; I will not reply to your observations with\\nregard to my duties. Never fear, Raymon; I am familiar with them and I\\ndid not love you little enough to disregard them without due reflection.\\nIt is not necessary to tell me that the scorn of mankind would have been\\nthe reward of my downfall; I was well aware of it. I knew too that the\\nstain would be deep, indelible and painful beyond words; that I should\\nbe spurned on all sides, cursed, covered with shame, and that I should\\nnot find a single friend to pity me and comfort me. The only mistake I\\nhad made was the feeling confident that you would open your arms to me,\\nand that you would assist me to forget the scorn, the misery and the\\ndesertion of my friends. The only thing I had not anticipated was that\\nyou might refuse to accept my sacrifice after I had consummated it. I\\nhad imagined that that was impossible. I went to your house with the\\nexpectation that you would repel me at first from principle and a sense\\nof duty, but firmly convinced that when you learned the inevitable\\nconsequences of what I had done, you would feel bound to assist me to\\nendure them. No, upon my word I would never have believed that you would\\nabandon me undefended to the consequences of such a dangerous\\nresolution, and that you would leave me to gather its bitter fruits\\ninstead of taking me to your bosom and making a rampart of your love.\\n\\n\"In that case how gladly I would have defied the distant mutterings of a\\nworld that was powerless to injure me! how I would have defied hatred,\\nbeing strong in your love! how feeble my remorse would have been, and\\nhow easily the passion you would have inspired would have stifled its\\nvoice! Engrossed by you alone, I would have forgotten myself; proud in\\nthe possession of your heart, I should have had no time to blush for my\\nown. A word from you, a glance, a kiss would have sufficed to absolve\\nme, and the memory of men and laws could have found no place in such a\\nlife. You see I was mad; according to your cynical expression I had\\nacquired my knowledge of life from novels written for lady\\'s-maids, from\\nthose gay, childish works of fiction in which the heart is interested in\\nthe success of wild enterprises and in impossible felicities. What you\\nsaid, Raymon, was horribly true! The thing that terrifies and crushes me\\nis that you are right.\\n\\n\"One thing that I cannot understand so well is that the impossibility\\nwas not the same for both of us; that I, a weak woman, derived from the\\nexaltation of my feelings sufficient strength to place myself alone in a\\nromantic, improbable situation, and that you, a brave man, could not\\nfind in your will-power, sufficient courage to follow me. And yet you\\nhad shared my dreams of the future, you had assented to my illusions,\\nyou had nourished in me that hope impossible of realization. For a long\\nwhile you had listened to my childish plans, my pygmy-like aspirations,\\nwith a smile on your lips and joy in your eyes, and your words were all\\nlove and gratitude. You too were blind, short-sighted, boastful. How did\\nit happen that your reason did not return until the danger was in sight?\\nWhy, I thought that danger charmed the eyes, strengthened the\\nresolution, put fear to flight; and yet you trembled like a leaf when\\nthe crisis came! Have you men no courage except the physical courage\\nthat defies death? are you not capable of the moral courage that\\nwelcomes misfortune? Do you, who explain everything so admirably,\\nexplain that to me, I beg.\\n\\n\"It may be that your dream was not like mine; in my case, you see,\\ncourage was love. You had fancied that you loved me, and you had\\nawakened, surprised to find that you had made such a mistake, on the day\\nthat I went forward trusting in the shelter of my mistake. Great God!\\nwhat an extraordinary delusion it was of yours, since you did not then\\nforesee all the obstacles that struck you when the time for action came!\\nsince you did not mention them to me until it was too late!\\n\\n\"But why should I reproach you now? Are we responsible for the impulses\\nof our hearts? was it in your power to say that you would always love\\nme? No, of course not. My misfortune consists in my inability to make\\nmyself agreeable to you longer and more really. I look about for the\\ncause of it and find none in my heart; but it apparently exists, none\\nthe less. Perhaps I loved you too well, perhaps my affection was\\nannoying and tiresome. You were a man, you loved liberty and pleasure. I\\nwas a burden to you. Sometimes I tried to put fetters on your life.\\nAlas! those were very paltry offences to plead in justification of such\\na cruel desertion!\\n\\n\"Enjoy, therefore, the liberty you have purchased at the expense of my\\nwhole life; I will interfere with it no more. Why did you not give me\\nthis lesson sooner? My wound would have been less deep, and yours also,\\nperhaps.\\n\\n\"Be happy! that is the last wish my broken heart will ever form! Do not\\nexhort me to think of God, leave that for the priests, who have to\\nsoften the hard hearts of the guilty. For my part, I have more faith\\nthan you; I do not serve the same God, but I serve Him more loyally and\\nwith a purer heart. Yours is the God of men, the king, the founder and\\nthe upholder of your race; mine is the God of the universe, the creator,\\nthe preserver and the hope of all creatures. Yours made everything for\\nyou alone; mine made all created things for one another. You deem\\nyourselves the masters of the world; I deem you only its tyrants. You\\nthink that God protects you and authorizes you to possess the empire of\\nthe earth; I think that He permits that for a little time, and that the\\nday will come when His breath will scatter you like grains of sand. No,\\nRaymon, you do not know God; or rather let me repeat what Ralph said to\\nyou one day at Lagny: you believe in nothing. Your education and your\\ncraving for an irresistible power to oppose to the brute force of the\\npeople, have led you to adopt without scrutiny the beliefs of your\\nfathers; but the conviction of God\\'s existence has never reached your\\nheart--I doubt if you have ever prayed to Him. For my part, I have but\\none belief, the only one probably that you have not: I believe in Him;\\nbut the religion you have devised I will have nothing to do with; all\\nyour morality, all your principles, are simply the interests of your\\nsocial order which you have raised to the dignity of laws and which you\\nclaim to trace back to God himself, just as your priests instituted the\\nrites and ceremonies of the church to establish their power over the\\nnations and amass wealth. But it is all falsehood and impiety. I, who\\ninvoke God and understand Him, know that there is nothing in common\\nbetween Him and you, and that by clinging to Him with all my strength I\\nseparate myself from you, whose constant aim it is to overthrow His\\nworks and sully His gifts. I tell you, it ill becomes you to invoke His\\nname to crush the resistance of a poor, weak woman, to stifle the\\nlamentations of a broken heart. God does not choose that the creations\\nof His hands shall be oppressed and trodden under foot. If He vouchsafed\\nto descend so far as to intervene in our paltry quarrels, He would crush\\nthe strong and raise the weak; He would pass His mighty hand over our\\nuneven heads and level them like the surface of the sea; He would say to\\nthe slave: \\'Cast off thy chains and fly to the mountains where I have\\nplaced water and flowers and sunshine for thee.\\' He would say to the\\nkings: \\'Throw your purple robes to the beggars to sit upon, and go to\\nsleep in the valleys where I have spread for you carpets of moss and\\nheather.\\' To the powerful He would say: \\'Bend your knees and bear the\\nburdens of your weaker brethren; for henceforth you will need them and I\\nwill give them strength and courage.\\' Yes, those are my dreams; they are\\nall of another life, of another world, where the laws of the brutal will\\nnot have passed over the heads of the peaceably inclined; where\\nresistance and flight will not be crimes; where man can escape man as\\nthe gazelle escapes the panther; where the chain of the law will not be\\nstretched about him to force him to throw himself under his enemy\\'s\\nfeet; and where the voice of prejudice will not be raised in his\\ndistress to insult his sufferings and to say to him: \\'You shall be\\ndeemed cowardly and base because you did not bend the knee and crawl.\\'\\n\\n\"No, do not talk to me about God, you of all men, Raymon; do not invoke\\nHis name to send me into exile and reduce me to silence. In submitting\\nas I do I yield to the power of men. If I listened to the voice which\\nGod has placed in the depths of my heart, and to the noble instinct of a\\nbold and strong nature, which perhaps is the genuine conscience, I\\nshould fly to the desert, I should learn to do without help, protection\\nand love: I should go and live for myself in the heart of our beautiful\\nmountains: I should forget the tyrants, the unjust and the ungrateful.\\nBut alas! man cannot do without his fellowman, and even Ralph cannot\\nlive alone.\\n\\n\"Adieu, Raymon! may you be happy without me! I forgive you for the harm\\nyou have done me. Talk of me sometimes to your mother, the best woman I\\nhave ever known. Understand that there is neither anger nor vengeance in\\nmy heart against you; my grief is worthy of the love I had for you.\\n\\n\\n\"INDIANA.\"\\n\\n\\nThe unfortunate creature was over-boastful. This profound and calm\\nsorrow was due simply to a sense of what her own dignity demanded when\\nshe addressed Raymon; but, when she was alone, she gave way freely to\\nits consuming violence. Sometimes, however, a vague gleam of hope shone\\nin her troubled eyes. Perhaps she never lost the last vestige of\\nconfidence in Raymon\\'s love, despite the cruel lessons of experience,\\ndespite the distressing thoughts which placed before her mind every day\\nhis indifference and indolence when his interests or his pleasures were\\nnot concerned. It is my belief that, if Indiana could have persuaded\\nherself to face the bald truth, she would not have dragged out her\\nhopeless, ruined life so long.\\n\\nWoman is naturally foolish; it is as if Heaven, to counterbalance the\\neminent superiority over us men which she owes to her delicacy of\\nperception, had implanted a blind vanity, an idiotic credulity in her\\nheart. It may be that one need only be an adept in the art of bestowing\\npraise and flattering the self-esteem, to obtain dominion over that\\nsubtle, supple and perspicacious being. Sometimes the men who are most\\nincapable of obtaining any sort of ascendancy over other men, obtain an\\nunbounded ascendancy over the minds of women. Flattery is the yoke that\\nbends those ardent but frivolous heads so low. Woe to him who undertakes\\nto be frank and outspoken in love! he will have Ralph\\'s fate.\\n\\nThis is what I should reply if you should tell me that Indiana is an\\nexceptional character, and that the ordinary woman displays neither her\\nstoical coolness nor her exasperating patience in resistance to conjugal\\ndespotism. I should tell you to look at the reverse of the medal, and\\nsee the miserable weakness, the stupid blindness she displays in her\\nrelations with Raymon. I should ask you where you ever found a woman who\\nwas not as ready to deceive as to be deceived; who had not the art to\\nconfine for ten years in the depths of her heart the secret of a hope\\nsacrificed so thoughtlessly in a day of frenzied excitement, and who\\nwould not become, in one man\\'s arms, as pitiably weak as she could be\\nstrong and invincible in another man\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV\\n\\n\\nMadame Delmare\\'s home had become more peaceable, however. With their\\nfalse friends had disappeared many of the difficulties which, under the\\nfostering hand of those officious meddlers, had been envenomed with all\\nthe warmth of their zeal. Sir Ralph, with his silence and his apparent\\nnon-interference, was more skilful than all of them in letting drop\\nthose airy trifles of intimate companionship which float about in the\\nfavoring breeze of pleasant gossip. But Indiana lived almost alone. Her\\nhouse was in the mountains above the town, and Monsieur Delmare, who had\\na warehouse in the port, went down every morning for the whole day, to\\nsuperintend his business with the Indies and with France. Sir Ralph, who\\nhad no other home than theirs, but who found ways to add to their\\ncomfort without their suspecting his gifts, devoted himself to the study\\nof natural history or to superintending the plantation; Indiana,\\nresuming the easy-going habits of creole life, passed the scorching\\nhours of the day in her straw chair, and the long evenings in the\\nsolitude of the mountains.\\n\\nBourbon is in truth, simply a huge cone, the base of which is about\\nforty leagues in circumference, while its gigantic mountain peaks rise\\nto the height of ten thousand feet. From almost every part of that\\nimposing mass, the eye can see in the distance, beyond the beetling\\nrocks, beyond the narrow valleys and stately forests, the unbroken\\nhorizon surrounding the azure-hued sea like a girdle. From her window,\\nIndiana could see between the twin peaks of a wooded mountain opposite\\nthat on which their house was built, the white sails on the Indian\\nOcean. During the silent hours of the day, that spectacle attracted her\\neyes and gave to her melancholy a fixed and uniform tinge of despair.\\nThat splendid sight made her musings bitter and gloomy, instead of\\ncasting its poetical influence upon them; and she would lower the\\ncurtain that hung at her window and shun the very daylight, in order to\\nshed bitter, scalding tears in the secrecy of her heart.\\n\\nBut when the land breeze began to blow, toward evening, and to bring to\\nher nostrils the fragrance of the flowering rice-fields, she would go\\nforth into the wilderness, leaving Delmare and Ralph on the veranda, to\\nenjoy the aromatic infusion of the _faham_ and to loiter over their\\ncigars. She would climb to the top of some accessible peak, the extinct\\ncrater of a former volcano, and gaze at the setting sun as it kindled\\nthe red vapors of the atmosphere into flame and spread a sort of dust of\\ngold and rubies over the murmuring stalks of the sugar cane and the\\nglistening walls of the cliff. She rarely went down into the gorges of\\nthe St. Gilles River, because the sight of the sea, although it\\ndistressed her, fascinated her with its magnetic mirage. It seemed to\\nher that beyond those waves and that distant haze the magic apparition\\nof another land would burst upon her gaze. Sometimes the clouds on the\\nshore assumed strange forms in her eyes: at one time she would see a\\nwhite wave rise upon the ocean and describe a gigantic line which she\\ntook for the façade of the Louvre; again two square sails would emerge\\nsuddenly from the mist and recall to her mind the towers of Notre-Dame\\nat Paris, when the Seine sends up a dense mist which surrounds their\\nfoundations and leaves them as if suspended in the sky; at other times\\nthere were patches of pink clouds which, in their changing shapes,\\nimitated all the caprices of architecture in a great city. That woman\\'s\\nmind slumbered in the illusions of the past, and she would quiver with\\njoy at sight of that magnificent Paris, whose realities were connected\\nwith the most unhappy period of her life. A curious sort of vertigo\\nwould take possession of her brain. Standing at a great height above the\\nshore, and watching the gorges that separated her from the ocean recede\\nbefore her eyes, it seemed as if she were flying swiftly through space\\ntoward the fascinating city of her imagination. Dreaming thus, she would\\ncling to the rock against which she was leaning, and to one who had at\\nsuch times seen her eager eyes, her bosom heaving with impatient longing\\nand the horrifying expression of joy on her face, she would have seemed\\nto manifest all the symptoms of madness. And yet those were her hours of\\npleasure, the only moments of well-being to which she looked forward\\nhopefully during the day. If her husband had taken it into his head to\\nforbid these solitary walks, I do not know what thought she would have\\nlived upon; for in her everything centred in a certain faculty of\\ninventing allusions, in an eager striving toward a point which was\\nneither memory, nor anticipation, nor hope, nor regret, but longing in\\nall its devouring intensity. Thus she lived for weeks and months beneath\\nthe tropical sky, recognizing, loving, caressing but one shade,\\ncherishing but one chimera.\\n\\nRalph, for his part, was attracted to gloomy, secluded spots in his\\nwalks, where the wind from the sea could not reach him; for the sight of\\nthe ocean had become as antipathetic to him as the thought of crossing\\nit again. France held only an accursed place in his heart\\'s memory.\\nThere it was that he had been unhappy to the point of losing courage,\\naccustomed as he was to unhappiness and patient with his misery. He\\nstrove with all his might to forget it; for, although he was intensely\\ndisgusted with life, he wished to live as long as he should feel that he\\nwas necessary. He was very careful therefore never to utter a word\\nrelating to the time he had passed in that country. What would he not\\nhave given to tear that ghastly memory from Madame Delmare\\'s mind! But\\nhe had so little confidence of his ability, he felt that he was so\\nawkward, so lacking in eloquence, that he avoided her instead of trying\\nto divert her thoughts. In the excess of his delicate reserve, he\\ncontinued to maintain the outward appearance of indifference and\\nselfishness. He went off and suffered alone, and, to see him scouring\\nwoods and mountains in pursuit of birds and insects, one would have\\ntaken him for a naturalist sportsman engrossed by his innocent passion\\nand utterly indifferent to the passions of the heart that were stirring\\nin his neighborhood. And yet hunting and study were merely the pretext\\nbehind which he concealed his long and bitter reveries.\\n\\nThis conical island is split at the base on all sides and conceals in\\nits embrasures deep gorges through which flow pure and turbulent\\nstreams. One of these gorges is called Bernica. It is a picturesque\\nspot, a sort of deep and narrow valley, hidden between two perpendicular\\nwalls of rock, the surface of which is studded with clumps of saxatile\\nshrubs and tufts of ferns.\\n\\nA stream flows in the narrow trough formed by the meeting of the two\\nsides. At the point where they meet it plunges down into frightful\\ndepths, and, where it falls, forms a basin surrounded by reeds and\\ncovered with a damp mist. Around its banks and along the edges of the\\ntiny stream fed by the overflow of the basin grow bananas and oranges,\\nwhose dark and healthy green clothe the inner walls of the gorge.\\nThither Ralph fled to avoid the heat and companionship. All his walks\\nled to that favorite goal; the cool, monotonous plash of the waterfall\\nlulled his melancholy to sleep. When his heart was torn by the secret\\nagony so long concealed, so cruelly misunderstood, it was there that he\\nexpended in unknown tears, in silent lamentations, the useless energy of\\nhis heart and the concentrated activity of his youth.\\n\\nIn order that you may understand Ralph\\'s character, it will be well to\\ntell you that at least half of his life had been passed in the depths of\\nthat ravine. Thither he had gone, in his early childhood, to steel his\\ncourage against the injustice with which he had been treated in his\\nfamily. It was there that he had put forth all the energies of his soul\\nto endure the destiny arbitrarily imposed upon him, and that he had\\nacquired the habit of stoicism which he had carried to such a point that\\nit had become a second nature to him. There too, in his youth, he had\\ncarried little Indiana on his shoulders; he had laid her on the grass by\\nthe stream while he fished in the clear water or tried to scale the\\ncliff in search of birds\\' nests.\\n\\nThe only dwellers in that solitude were the gulls, petrels, coots and\\nsea-swallows. Those birds were incessantly flying up and down, hovering\\noverhead or circling about, having chosen the holes and clefts in those\\ninaccessible walls to rear their wild broods. Toward night they would\\nassemble in restless groups and fill the echoing gorge with their\\nhoarse, savage cries. Ralph liked to follow their majestic flight, to\\nlisten to their melancholy voices. He taught his little pupil their\\nnames and their habits; he showed her the lovely Madagascar teal, with\\nits orange breast and emerald back; he bade her admire the flight of the\\nred-winged tropic-bird, which sometimes strays to those regions and\\nflies in a few hours from Mauritius to Rodrigues, whither, after a\\njourney of two hundred leagues, it returns to sleep under the\\n_veloutier_ in which its nest is hidden. The petrel, harbinger of the\\ntempest, also spread its tapering wings over those cliffs; and the queen\\nof the sea, the frigate-bird, with its forked tail, its slate-colored\\ncoat and its jagged beak, which lights so rarely that it would seem that\\nthe air is its country, and constant movement its nature, raised its cry\\nof distress above all the rest. These wild inhabitants were apparently\\naccustomed to seeing the two children playing about the dwellings, for\\nthey hardly condescended to take fright at their approach; and when\\nRalph reached the shelf on which they had installed their families, they\\nwould rise in black clouds and light, as if in derision, a few feet\\nabove him. Indiana would laugh at their evolutions, and would carry\\nhome, carefully, in her hat of rice-straw, the eggs Ralph had succeeded\\nin stealing for her, and for which he had often to fight stoutly against\\npowerful blows from the wings of the great amphibious creatures.\\n\\nThese memories rushed tumultuously to Ralph\\'s mind, but they were\\nextremely bitter to him; for times had changed greatly, and the little\\ngirl who had always been his companion had ceased to be his friend, or\\nat all events was no longer his friend, as formerly, in absolute\\nsimpleness of heart. Although she returned his affection, his devotion,\\nhis regard, there was one thing which prevented any confidence between\\nthem, one memory upon which all the emotions of their lives turned as\\nupon a pivot. Ralph felt that he could not refer to it; he had ventured\\nto do it once, on a day of danger, and his bold act had availed nothing.\\nTo recur to it now would be nothing more than cold-blooded barbarity,\\nand Ralph had made up his mind to forgive Raymon, the man for whom he\\nhad less esteem than for any man on earth, rather than add to Indiana\\'s\\nsorrow by condemning him according to his own ideas of what justice\\ndemanded.\\n\\nSo he held his peace and even avoided her. Although living under the\\nsame roof, he had managed so that he hardly saw her except at meals; and\\nyet he watched over her like a mysterious providence. He left the house\\nonly when the heat confined her to her hammock; but at night, when she\\nhad gone out, he would invent an excuse for leaving Delmare on the\\nveranda and would go and wait for her at the foot of the cliffs where he\\nknew she was in the habit of sitting. He would remain there whole hours,\\nsometimes gazing at her through the branches upon which the moon cast\\nits white light, but respecting the narrow space which separated them,\\nand never venturing to shorten her sad reverie by an instant. When she\\ncame down into the valley she always found him on the edge of a little\\nstream along which ran the path to the house. Several broad flat stones,\\naround which the water rippled in silver threads, served him as a seat.\\nWhen Indiana\\'s white dress appeared on the bank, Ralph would rise\\nsilently, offer her his arm and take her back to the house without\\nspeaking to her, unless Indiana, being more discouraged and depressed\\nthan usual, herself opened the conversation. Then, when he had left her,\\nhe would go to his own room and wait until the whole house was asleep\\nbefore going to bed. If he heard Delmare scolding, Ralph would grasp the\\nfirst pretext that came to his mind to go to him, and would succeed in\\npacifying him or diverting his thoughts without ever allowing him to\\nsuspect that such was his purpose.\\n\\nThe construction of the house, which was transparent, so to speak,\\ncompared with the houses in our climate, and the consequent necessity of\\nbeing always under the eyes of everybody else, compelled the colonel to\\nput more restraint upon his temper. Ralph\\'s inevitable appearance, at\\nthe slightest sound, to stand between him and his wife, forced him to\\nkeep a check upon himself; for Delmare had sufficient self-esteem to\\nretain control of himself before that acute but stern censor. And so he\\nwaited until the hour for retiring had delivered him from his judge\\nbefore venting the ill-humor which business vexations had heaped up\\nduring the day. But it was of no avail; the secret influence kept vigil\\nwith him, and, at the first harsh word, at the first loud tone that was\\naudible through the thin partitions, the sound of moving furniture or of\\nsomebody walking about, as if by accident, in Ralph\\'s room, seemed to\\nimpose silence on him and to warn him that the silent and patient\\nsolicitude of Indiana\\'s protector was not asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART FOURTH\\n\\n\\nXXV\\n\\n\\nNow it happened that the ministry of the 8th of August, which overturned\\nso many things in France, dealt a serious blow at Raymon\\'s security.\\nMonsieur de Ramière was not one of those blindly vain mortals who\\ntriumph on a day of victory. He had made politics the mainspring of all\\nhis ideas, the basis of all his dreams of the future. He had flattered\\nhimself that the king, by adopting a policy of shrewd concessions, would\\nmaintain for a long time to come the equilibrium which assured the\\nexistence of the noble families. But the rise to power of the Prince de\\nPolignac destroyed that hope. Raymon saw too far ahead, he was too well\\nacquainted with the new society not to stand on his guard against\\nmomentary triumphs. He understood that his whole future trembled in the\\nbalance with that of the monarchy, and that his fortune, perhaps his\\nlife, hung by a thread.\\n\\nThereupon he found himself in a delicate and embarrassing position.\\nHonor made it his duty to devote himself, despite all the risks of such\\ndevotion, to the family whose interests had been thus far closely\\nconnected with his own. In that respect he could hardly disregard his\\nconscience and the memory of his forefathers. But this new order of\\nthings, this tendency toward an absolute despotism, offended his\\nprudence, his common-sense, and, so he said, his convictions. It\\ncompromised his whole existence, it did worse than that, it made him\\nridiculous, him, a renowned publicist who had ventured so many times to\\npromise, in the name of the crown, justice for all and fidelity to the\\nsworn compact. But now all the acts of the government gave a formal\\ncontradiction to the young eclectic politician\\'s imprudent assertions;\\nall the calm and slothful minds who, two days earlier, asked nothing\\nbetter than to cling to the constitutional throne, began to throw\\nthemselves into the opposition and to denounce as rascality the efforts\\nof Raymon and his fellows. The most courteous accused him of lack of\\nforesight and incapacity. Raymon felt that it was humiliating to be\\nconsidered a dupe after playing such a brilliant rôle in the game. He\\nbegan secretly to curse and despise this royalty which thus degraded\\nitself and involved him in its downfall; he would have liked to be able\\nto cut loose from it without disgrace before the hour of battle. For\\nsome time he made incredible efforts to gain the confidence of both\\ncamps. The opposition ranks of that period were not squeamish concerning\\nthe admission of new recruits. They needed them, and the credentials\\nthey required were so trivial, that they enlisted considerable numbers.\\nNor did they disdain the support of great names, and day after day\\nadroitly flattering allusions in their newspapers tended to detach the\\nbrightest gems from that worn-out crown. Raymon was not deceived by\\nthese demonstrations of esteem; but he did not reject them, for he was\\ncertain of their utility. On the other hand, the champions of the throne\\nbecame more intolerant as their situation became more desperate. They\\ndrove from their ranks, without prudence and without regard for\\npropriety, their strongest defenders. They soon began to manifest their\\ndissatisfaction and distrust to Raymon. He, in his embarrassment,\\nattached to his reputation as the principal ornament of his existence,\\nwas very opportunely taken down with an acute attack of rheumatism,\\nwhich compelled him to abandon work of every sort for the moment and to\\ngo into the country with his mother.\\n\\nIn his isolation Raymon really suffered to feel that he was like a\\ncorpse amid the devouring activity of a society on the brink of\\ndissolution, to feel that he was prevented, by his embarrassment as to\\nthe color he should assume no less than by illness, from enlisting under\\nthe warlike banners that waved on all sides, summoning the most obscure\\nand the least experienced to the great conflict. The intense pains of\\nhis malady, solitude, ennui and fever insensibly turned his ideas into\\nanother channel. He asked himself, for the first time, perhaps, if\\nsociety had deserved all the pains he had taken to make himself\\nagreeable to it, and he judged society justly when he saw that it was so\\nindifferent with regard to him, so forgetful of his talents and his\\nglory. Then he took comfort for having been its dupe by assuring himself\\nthat he had never sought anything but his personal gratification; and\\nthat he had found it there, thanks to himself. Nothing so confirms us in\\negotism as reflection. Raymon drew this conclusion from it: that man, in\\nthe social state, requires two sorts of happiness, happiness in public\\nlife and in private life, social triumphs and domestic joys.\\n\\nHis mother, who nursed him assiduously, fell dangerously ill; it was his\\nturn to forget his own sufferings and to take care of her; but his\\nstrength was not sufficient. Ardent, passionate souls display miraculous\\nstores of health in times of danger; but lukewarm, indolent souls do not\\narouse such supernatural outbursts of bodily strength. Although Raymon\\nwas a good son, as the phrase is understood in society, he succumbed\\nphysically under the weight of fatigue. Lying on his bed of pain, with\\nno one at his pillow save hirelings and now and then a friend who was in\\nhaste to return to the excitements of social life, he began to think of\\nIndiana, and he sincerely regretted her, for at that time she would have\\nbeen most useful to him. He remembered the dutiful attentions she had\\nlavished on her crabbed old husband and he imagined the gentle and\\nbeneficent care with which she would have encompassed her lover.\\n\\n\"If I had accepted her sacrifice,\" he thought, \"she would be dishonored;\\nbut what would it matter to me now? Abandoned as I am by a frivolous,\\nselfish world, I should not be alone; she whom everybody spurned with\\ncontumely would be at my feet, impelled by love; she would weep over my\\nsufferings and would find a way to allay them. Why did I discard that\\nwoman? She loved me so dearly that she would have found consolation for\\nthe insults of her fellows by bringing a little happiness into my\\ndomestic life.\"\\n\\nHe determined to marry when he recovered, and he mentally reviewed the\\nnames and faces that had impressed him in the salons of the two\\ndivisions of society. Fascinating apparitions flitted through his\\ndreams; head-dresses laden with flowers, snowy shoulders enveloped in\\nswansdown capes, supple forms imprisoned in muslin or satin: such\\nalluring phantoms fluttered their gauze wings before Raymon\\'s heavy,\\nburning eyes; but he had seen these peris only in the perfumed whirl of\\nthe ballroom. On waking, he asked himself whether their rosy lips knew\\nany other smiles than those of coquetry; whether their white hands could\\ndress the wounds of sorrow; whether their refined and brilliant wit\\ncould stoop to the painful task of consoling and diverting a horribly\\nbored invalid. Raymon was a man of keen intelligence and he was more\\ndistrustful than other men of the coquetry of women; he had a more\\nintense hatred of selfishness because he knew that from a selfish person\\nhe could obtain nothing to advance his own happiness. And then Raymon\\nwas no less embarrassed concerning the choice of a wife than concerning\\nthe choice of his political colors. The same reasons imposed moderation\\nand prudence on him. He belonged to a family of high rank and unbending\\npride which would brook no mésalliance, and yet wealth could no longer\\nbe considered secure except in plebeian hands. According to all\\nappearance that class was destined to rise over the ruins of the other,\\nand in order to maintain oneself on the surface of the movement one must\\nbe the son-in-law of a manufacturer or a stock-broker. Raymon concluded\\ntherefore that it would be wise to wait and see which way the wind blew\\nbefore entering upon a course of action which would decide his whole\\nfuture.\\n\\nThese positive reflections made plain to him the utter lack of affection\\nwhich characterizes marriages of convenience, so-called, and the hope of\\nhaving some day a companion worthy of his love entered only incidentally\\ninto his prospects of happiness. Meanwhile his illness might be\\nprolonged, and the hope of better days to come does not efface the keen\\nconsciousness of present pains. He recurred to the unpleasant thought of\\nhis blindness on the day he had declined to kidnap Madame Delmare, and\\nhe cursed himself for having comprehended so imperfectly his real\\ninterests.\\n\\nAt this juncture he received the letter Indiana wrote him from Ile\\nBourbon. The sombre and inflexible energy which she retained, amid\\nshocks which might well have crushed her spirit, made a profound\\nimpression on Raymon.\\n\\n\"I judged her ill,\" he thought; \"she really loved me, she still loves\\nme; for my sake she would have been capable of those heroic efforts\\nwhich I considered to be beyond a woman\\'s strength; and now I probably\\nneed say but a word to draw her, like an irresistible magnet, from one\\nend of the world to the other. If six months, eight months, perhaps,\\nwere not necessary to obtain that result, I would like to make the\\ntrial!\"\\n\\nHe fell asleep meditating that idea: but he was soon awakened by a great\\ncommotion in the next room. He rose with difficulty, put on a\\ndressing-gown, and dragged himself to his mother\\'s apartment. She was\\nvery ill.\\n\\nToward morning she found strength to talk with him; she was under no\\nillusion as to the brief time she had yet to live and her mind was busy\\nwith her son\\'s future.\\n\\n\"You are about to lose your best friend,\" she said; \"may Heaven replace\\nher by a companion worthy of you! But be prudent, Raymon, and do not\\nrisk the repose of your whole life for a mere chimera of your ambition.\\nI have known but one woman, alas! whom I should have cared to call my\\ndaughter; but Heaven has disposed of her. But listen, my son. Monsieur\\nDelmare is old and broken; who knows if that long voyage did not exhaust\\nthe rest of his vitality? Respect his wife as long as he lives; but if,\\nas I believe will be the case, he is summoned soon to follow me to the\\ngrave, remember there is still one woman in the world who loves you\\nalmost as dearly as your mother loved you.\"\\n\\nThat evening Madame de Ramière died in her son\\'s arms. Raymon\\'s grief\\nwas deep and bitter; in the face of such a loss there could be neither\\nfalse emotion nor selfish scheming. His mother was really necessary to\\nhim; with her he lost all the moral comfort of his life. He shed\\ndespairing tears upon her pallid forehead, her lifeless eyes. He\\nmaligned Heaven, he cursed his destiny, he wept for Indiana. He called\\nGod to account for the happiness He owed him. He reproached Him for\\ntreating him like other men and tearing everything from him at once.\\nThen he doubted the existence of this God who chastised him; he chose to\\ndeny Him rather than submit to His decrees. He lost all the illusions\\nwith all the realities of life; and he returned to his bed of fever and\\nsuffering, as crushed and hopeless as a deposed king, as a fallen angel.\\n\\nWhen he was nearly restored to health, he cast a glance at the condition\\nof France. Matters were going from bad to worse; on all sides there were\\nthreats of refusal to pay taxes. Raymon was amazed at the foolish\\nconfidence of his party, and deeming it wise not to plunge into the\\nmêlée as yet, he shut himself up at Cercy with the melancholy memory\\nof his mother and Madame Delmare.\\n\\nBy dint of pondering the idea to which he had attached little importance\\nat its first conception, he accustomed himself to the thought that\\nIndiana was not lost to him, if he chose to take the trouble to beckon\\nher back. He detected many inconveniences in the scheme but many more\\nadvantages. It was not in accord with his interest to wait until she was\\na widow before marrying her, as Madame de Ramière had suggested.\\nDelmare might live twenty years longer, and Raymon did not choose to\\nrenounce forever the chance of a brilliant marriage. He conceived a\\nbetter plan than that in his cheerful and fertile imagination. He could,\\nby taking a little trouble, exert an unbounded influence over his\\nIndiana; he felt that he possessed sufficient mental cunning and knavery\\nto make of that enthusiastic and sublime creature a devoted and\\nsubmissive mistress. He could shield her from the ferocity of public\\nopinion, conceal her behind the impenetrable wall of his private life,\\nkeep her as a precious treasure in the depths of his retreat, and employ\\nher to sweeten his moments of solitude and meditation with the joys of a\\npure and generous affection. He would not have to exert himself overmuch\\nto escape the husband\\'s wrath; he would not come three thousand leagues\\nin pursuit of his wife when his business interests made his presence\\nabsolutely necessary in the other hemisphere. Indiana would demand\\nlittle in the way of pleasure and liberty after the bitter trials which\\nhad bent her neck to the yoke. She was ambitious only for love, and\\nRaymon felt that he would love her from gratitude as soon as she made\\nherself useful to him. He remembered also the constancy and gentleness\\nshe had shown during the long days of his coldness and neglect. He\\npromised himself that he would cleverly retain his liberty, so that she\\nwould not dare to complain. He flattered himself that he could acquire\\nsufficient control over her convictions to make her consent to anything,\\neven to his marriage; and he based that hope upon numerous examples of\\nsecret liaisons which he had known to continue despite the laws of\\nsociety, by virtue of the prudence and skill with which the parties had\\nsucceeded in avoiding the judgment of public opinion.\\n\\n\"Besides,\" he said to himself, \"that woman will have made an\\nirrevocable, boundless sacrifice for me. She will have travelled the\\nworld over for me and have left behind her all means of existence--all\\npossibility of pardon. Society is stern and unforgiving only to paltry,\\ncommonplace faults. Uncommon audacity takes it by surprise, notorious\\nmisfortune disarms it; it will pity, perhaps admire this woman who will\\nhave done for me what no other woman would have dared to try. It will\\nblame her, but it will not laugh at her, and I shall not be blamed for\\ntaking her in and protecting her after such a signal proof of her love.\\nPerhaps, on the contrary, my courage will be extolled, at all events I\\nshall have defenders, and my reputation will undergo a glorious and\\nindecisive trial. Society likes to be defied sometimes; it does not\\naccord its admiration to those who crawl along the beaten paths. In\\nthese days public opinion must be driven with a whip.\"\\n\\nUnder the influence of these thoughts he wrote to Madame Delmare. His\\nletter was what it was sure to be from the pen of so adroit and\\nexperienced a man. It breathed love, grief, and, above all, truth. Alas!\\nwhat a slender reed the truth is, to bend thus with every breath!\\n\\nHowever, Raymon was wise enough not to express the object of his letter\\nin so many words. He pretended to look upon Indiana\\'s return as a joy of\\nwhich he had no hope; but he had but little to say of her duty. He\\nrepeated his mother\\'s last words; he described with much warmth the\\nstate of despair to which his loss had reduced him, the ennui of\\nsolitude and the danger of his position politically. He drew a dismal\\nand terrifying picture of the revolution that was rising above the\\nhorizon, and, while feigning to rejoice that he was to meet its coming\\nalone, he gave Indiana to understand that the moment had come for her to\\nmanifest that enthusiastic loyalty, that perilous devotion of which she\\nhad boasted so confidently. He cursed his destiny and said that virtue\\nhad cost him very dear, that his yoke was very heavy: that he had held\\nhappiness in his hand and had had the strength of will to doom himself\\nto eternal solitude.\\n\\n\"Do not tell me again that you once loved me,\" he added; \"I am so weak\\nand discouraged that I curse my courage and hate my duties. Tell me that\\nyou are happy, that you have forgotten me, so that I may have strength\\nnot to come and tear you away from the bonds that keep you from me.\"\\n\\nIn a word, he said that he was unhappy; that was equivalent to telling\\nIndiana that he expected her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI\\n\\n\\nDuring the three months that elapsed between the despatch of this letter\\nand its arrival at Ile Bourbon, Madame Delmare\\'s situation had become\\nalmost intolerable, as the result of a domestic incident of the greatest\\nimportance to her. She had adopted the depressing habit of writing down\\nevery evening a narrative of the sorrowful thoughts of the day. This\\njournal of her sufferings was addressed to Raymon, and, although she had\\nno intention of sending it to him, she talked with him, sometimes\\npassionately, sometimes bitterly, of the misery of her life and of the\\nsentiments which she could not overcome. These papers fell into\\nDelmare\\'s hands, that is to say, he broke open the box which contained\\nthem as well as Raymon\\'s letters, and devoured them with a jealous,\\nfrenzied eye. In the first outbreak of his wrath he lost the power to\\nrestrain himself and went outside, with fast-beating heart and clenched\\nfists, to await her return from her walk. Perhaps, if she had been a few\\nminutes later, the unhappy man would have had time to recover himself;\\nbut their evil star decreed that she should appear before him almost\\nimmediately. Thereupon, unable to utter a word, he seized her by the\\nhair, threw her down and stamped on her forehead with his heel.\\n\\nHe had no sooner made that bloody mark of his brutal nature upon a poor,\\nweak creature, than he was horrified at what he had done. He fled in\\ndire dismay, and locked himself in his room, where he cocked his pistol\\npreparatory to blowing out his brains; but as he was about to pull the\\ntrigger he looked out on the veranda and saw that Indiana had risen and,\\nwith a calm, self-possessed air, was wiping away the blood that covered\\nher face. As he thought that he had killed her, his first feeling was of\\njoy when he saw her on her feet; then his wrath blazed up anew.\\n\\n\"It is only a scratch,\" he cried, \"and you deserve a thousand deaths!\\nNo, I will not kill myself; for then you would go and rejoice over it in\\nyour lover\\'s arms. I do not propose to assure the happiness of both of\\nyou; I propose to live to make you suffer, to see you die by inches of\\ndeathly ennui, to dishonor the infamous creature who has made a fool of\\nme!\"\\n\\nHe was battling with the tortures of jealous rage, when Ralph entered\\nthe veranda by another door and found Indiana in the dishevelled\\ncondition in which that horrible scene had left her. But she had not\\nmanifested the slightest alarm, she had not uttered a cry, she had not\\nraised her hand to ask for mercy. Weary of life as she was, it seemed\\nthat she had been desirous to give Delmare time to commit murder by\\nrefraining from calling for help. It is certain that when the assault\\ntook place Ralph was within twenty yards, and that he had not heard the\\nslightest sound.\\n\\n\"Indiana!\" he cried, recoiling in horror and surprise; \"who has wounded\\nyou thus?\"\\n\\n\"Do you ask?\" she replied with a bitter smile; \"what other than _your\\nfriend_ has the _right_ and the inclination?\"\\n\\nRalph dropped the cane he held; he needed no other weapons than his\\ngreat hands to strangle Delmare. He reached his door in two leaps and\\nburst it open with his fist. But he found Delmare lying on the floor,\\nwith purple cheeks and swollen throat, struggling in the noiseless\\nconvulsions of apoplexy.\\n\\nHe seized the papers that were scattered over the floor. When he\\nrecognized Raymon\\'s handwriting and saw the ruins of the letter-box, he\\nunderstood what had happened; and, carefully collecting the accusing\\ndocuments, he hastened to hand them to Madame Delmare and urged her to\\nburn them at once. Delmare had probably not taken time to read them all.\\n\\nThen he begged her to go to her room while he summoned the slaves to\\nlook after the colonel; but she would neither burn the papers nor hide\\nthe wound.\\n\\n\"No,\" she said haughtily, \"I will not do it! That man did not scruple to\\ntell Madame de Carvajal of my flight long ago; he made haste to publish\\nwhat he called my dishonor. I propose to show to everybody this token of\\nhis own dishonor which he has taken pains to stamp on my face. It is a\\nstrange sort of justice that requires one to keep secret another\\'s\\ncrimes, when that other assumes the right to brand one without mercy!\"\\n\\nWhen Ralph found the colonel was in a condition to listen to him, he\\nheaped reproaches upon him with more energy and severity than one would\\nhave thought him capable of exhibiting. Thereupon Delmare, who certainly\\nwas not an evil-minded man, wept like a child over what he had done; but\\nhe wept without dignity, as a man can do when he abandons himself to the\\nsensation of the moment, without reasoning as to its causes and effects.\\nPrompt to jump to the opposite extreme, he would have called his wife\\nand solicited her pardon; but Ralph objected and tried to make him\\nunderstand that such a puerile reconciliation would impair the authority\\nof one without wiping out the injury done to the other. He was well\\naware that there are injuries which are never forgiven and miseries\\nwhich one can never forget.\\n\\nFrom that moment, the husband\\'s personality became hateful in the wife\\'s\\neyes. All that he did to atone for his treatment of her deprived him of\\nthe slight consideration he had retained thus far. He had in very truth\\nmade a tremendous mistake; the man who does not feel strong enough to be\\ncold and implacable in his vengeance should abjure all thought of\\nimpatience or resentment. There is no possible rôle between that of the\\nChristian who forgives and that of the man of the world who spurns. But\\nDelmare had his share of selfishness too; he felt that he was growing\\nold, that his wife\\'s care was becoming more necessary to him every day.\\nHe was terribly afraid of solitude, and if, in the paroxysm of his\\nwounded pride, he recurred to his habits as a soldier and maltreated\\nher, reflection soon led him back to the characteristic weakness of old\\nmen, whom the thought of desertion terrifies. Too enfeebled by age and\\nhardships to aspire to become a father, he had remained an old bachelor\\nin his home, and had taken a wife as he would have taken a housekeeper.\\nIt was not from affection for her, therefore, that he forgave her for\\nnot loving him, but from regard for his own comfort: and if he grieved\\nat his failure to command her affections, it was because he was afraid\\nthat he should be less carefully tended in his old age.\\n\\nWhen Madame Delmare, for her part, being deeply aggrieved by the\\noperation of the laws of society, summoned all her strength of mind to\\nhate and despise them, there was a wholly personal feeling at the bottom\\nof her thoughts. But it may be that this craving for happiness which\\nconsumes us, this hatred of injustice, this thirst for liberty which\\nends only with life, are the constituent elements of _egotism_, a name\\nby which the English designate love of self, considered as one of the\\nprivileges of mankind and not as a vice. It seems to me that the\\nindividual who is selected out of all the rest to suffer from the\\nworking of institutions that are advantageous to his fellowmen ought, if\\nhe has the least energy in his soul, to struggle against this arbitrary\\nyoke. I also think that the greater and more noble his soul is, the more\\nit should rankle and fester under the blows of injustice. If he has ever\\ndreamed that happiness was to be the reward of virtue, into what ghastly\\ndoubts, what desperate perplexity must he be cast by the disappointments\\nwhich experience brings!\\n\\nThus all Indiana\\'s reflections, all her acts, all her sorrows were a\\npart of this great and terrible struggle between nature and\\ncivilization. If the desert mountains of the island could have concealed\\nher long, she would assuredly have taken refuge among them on the day of\\nthe assault upon her; but Bourbon was not of sufficient extent to afford\\nher a secure hiding-place, and she determined to place the sea and\\nuncertainty as to her place of refuge between her tyrant and herself.\\nWhen she had formed this resolution, she felt more at ease and was\\nalmost gay and unconcerned at home. Delmare was so surprised and\\ndelighted that he indulged apart in this brutal reasoning: that it was a\\ngood thing to make women feel the law of the strongest now and then.\\n\\nThereafter she thought of nothing but flight, solitude and independence;\\nshe considered in her tortured, grief-stricken brain innumerable plans\\nof a romantic establishment in the deserts of India or Africa. At night\\nshe followed the flight of the birds to their resting-place at Ile\\nRodrigue. That deserted island promised her all the pleasures of\\nsolitude, the first craving of a broken heart. But the same reasons that\\nprevented her from flying to the interior of Bourbon caused her to\\nabandon the idea of seeking refuge in the small islands near by. She\\noften met at the house tradesmen from Madagascar, who had business\\nrelations with her husband; dull, vulgar, copper-colored fellows who had\\nno tact or shrewdness except in forwarding their business interests.\\nTheir stories attracted Madame Delmare\\'s attention, none the less; she\\nenjoyed questioning them concerning the marvelous products of that\\nisland, and what they told her of the prodigies performed by nature\\nthere intensified more and more the desire that she felt to go and hide\\nherself away there. The size of the island and the fact that Europeans\\noccupied so small a portion of it led her to hope that she would never\\nbe discovered. She decided upon that place, therefore, and fed her idle\\nmind upon dreams of a future which she proposed to create for herself,\\nunassisted. She was already building her solitary cabin under the shade\\nof a primeval forest, on the bank of a nameless river; she fancied\\nherself taking refuge under the protection of those savage tribes whom\\nthe yoke of our laws and our prejudices has not debased. Ignorant\\ncreature that she was, she hoped to find there the virtues that are\\nbanished from our hemisphere, and to live in peace, unvexed by any\\nsocial constitution; she imagined that she could avoid the dangers of\\nisolation, escape the malignant diseases of the climate. A weak woman,\\nwho could not endure the anger of one man, but flattered herself that\\nshe could defy the hardships of uncivilized life!\\n\\nAmid these romantic thoughts and extravagant plans she forgot her\\npresent ills; she made for herself a world apart, which consoled her for\\nthat in which she was compelled to live; she accustomed herself to think\\nless of Raymon, who was soon to cease to be a part of her solitary and\\nphilosophical existence. She was so busily occupied in constructing for\\nherself a future according to her fancy that she let the past rest a\\nlittle; and already, as she felt that her heart was freer and braver,\\nshe imagined that she was reaping in advance the fruits of her solitary\\nlife. But Raymon\\'s letter arrived, and that edifice of chimeras vanished\\nlike a breath. She felt, or fancied that she felt, that she loved him\\nmore than before. For my part, I like to think that she never loved him\\nwith all the strength of her soul. It seems to me that misplaced\\naffection is as different from requited affection as an error from the\\ntruth. It seems to me that, although the excitement and ardor of our\\nsentiments abuse us to the point of believing that that is love in all\\nits power, we learn later, when we taste the delights of a true love,\\nhow entirely we deceived ourselves.\\n\\nBut Raymon\\'s situation, as he described it, rekindled in Indiana\\'s heart\\nthat generous flame which was a necessity of her nature. Fancying him\\nalone and unhappy, she considered it her duty to forget the past and not\\nto anticipate the future. A few hours earlier, she intended to leave her\\nhusband under the spur of hatred and resentment; now, she regretted that\\nshe did not esteem him so that she might make a real sacrifice for\\nRaymon\\'s sake. So great was her enthusiasm that she feared that she was\\ndoing too little for him in fleeing from an irascible master at the\\nperil of her life, and subjecting herself to the miseries of a four\\nmonths\\' voyage. She would have given her life, with the idea that it was\\ntoo small a price to pay for a smile from Raymon. Women are made that\\nway.\\n\\nThus it was simply a question of leaving the island. It was very\\ndifficult to elude Delmare\\'s distrust and Ralph\\'s clear-sightedness. But\\nthose were not the principal obstacles; it was necessary to avoid giving\\nthe notice of her proposed departure, which, according to law, every\\npassenger is compelled to give through the newspapers.\\n\\nAmong the few vessels lying in the dangerous roadstead of Bourbon was\\nthe ship _Eugène_, soon to sail for Europe. For a long while Indiana\\nsought an opportunity to speak with the captain without her husband\\'s\\nknowledge, but whenever she expressed a wish to walk down to the port,\\nhe ostentatiously placed her in Ralph\\'s charge, and followed them with\\nhis own eyes with maddening persistence. However, by dint of picking up\\nwith the greatest care every scrap of information favorable to her plan,\\nIndiana learned that the captain of the vessel bound for France had a\\nkinswoman at the village of Saline in the interior of the island, and\\nthat he often returned from her house on foot, to sleep on board. From\\nthat moment she hardly left the cliff that served as her post of\\nobservation. To avert suspicion, she went thither by roundabout paths,\\nand returned in the same way at night when she had failed to discover\\nthe person in whom she was interested on the road to the mountains.\\n\\nShe had but two days of hope remaining, for the land-wind had already\\nbegun to blow. The anchorage threatened to become untenable, and Captain\\nRandom was impatient to be at sea.\\n\\nHowever, she prayed earnestly to the God of the weak and oppressed, and\\nwent and stationed herself on the very road to Saline, disregarding the\\ndanger of being seen, and risking her last hope. She had not been\\nwaiting an hour when Captain Random came down the path. He was a genuine\\nsailor, always rough-spoken and cynical, whether he was in good or bad\\nhumor; his expression froze Indiana\\'s blood with terror. Nevertheless,\\nshe mustered all her courage and walked to meet him with a dignified and\\nresolute air.\\n\\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"I place my honor and my life in your hands. I\\nwish to leave the colony and return to France. If, instead of granting\\nme your protection, you betray the secret I confide to you, there is\\nnothing left for me to do but throw myself into the sea.\"\\n\\nThe captain replied with an oath that the sea would refuse to sink such\\na pretty lugger, and that, as she had come of her own accord and hove to\\nunder his lee, he would promise to tow her to the end of the world.\\n\\n\"You consent then, monsieur?\" said Madame Delmare anxiously. \"In that\\ncase here is the pay for my passage in advance.\"\\n\\nAnd she handed him a casket containing the jewels Madame de Carvajal had\\ngiven her long before; they were the only fortune that she still\\npossessed. But the sailor had different ideas, and he returned the\\ncasket with words that brought the blood to her cheeks.\\n\\n\"I am very unfortunate, monsieur,\" she replied, restraining the tears of\\nwrath that glistened behind her long lashes; \"the proposition I am\\nmaking to you justifies you in insulting me; and yet, if you knew how\\nodious my life in this country is to me, you would have more pity than\\ncontempt for me.\"\\n\\nIndiana\\'s noble and touching countenance imposed respect on Captain\\nRandom. Those who do not wear out their natural delicacy by over-use\\nsometimes find it healthy and unimpaired in an emergency. He recalled\\nColonel Delmare\\'s unattractive features and the sensation that his\\nattack on his wife had caused in the colonies. While ogling with a\\nlustful eye that fragile, pretty creature, he was struck by her air of\\ninnocence and sincerity. He was especially moved when he noticed on her\\nforehead a white mark which the deep flush on her face brought out in\\nbold relief. He had had some business relations with Delmare which had\\nleft him ill-disposed toward him; he was so close-fisted and unyielding\\nin business matters.\\n\\n\"Damnation!\" he cried, \"I have nothing but contempt for a man who is\\ncapable of kicking such a pretty woman in the face! Delmare\\'s a pirate,\\nand I am not sorry to play this trick on him; but be prudent, madame,\\nand remember that I am compromising my good name. You must make your\\nescape quietly when the moon has set, and fly like a poor petrel from\\nthe foot of some sombre reef.\"\\n\\n\"I know, monsieur,\" she replied, \"that you cannot do me this very great\\nfavor without transgressing the law; you may perhaps have to pay a fine;\\nthat is why I offer you this casket, the contents of which are worth at\\nleast twice the price of a passage.\"\\n\\nThe captain took the casket with a smile.\\n\\n\"This is not the time to settle our account,\" he said; \"I am willing to\\ntake charge of your little fortune. Under the circumstances I suppose\\nyou won\\'t have very much luggage; on the night we are to sail, hide\\namong the rocks at the _Anse aux Lataniers_; between one and two o\\'clock\\nin the morning a boat will come ashore pulled by two stout rowers, and\\nbring you aboard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\n\\nThe day preceding her departure passed away like a dream. Indiana was\\nafraid that it would be long and painful; it seemed to last but a\\nmoment. The silence of the neighborhood, the peaceful tranquillity\\nwithin the house were in striking contrast to the internal agitation by\\nwhich Madame Delmare was consumed. She locked herself into her room to\\nprepare the few clothes she intended to carry; then she concealed them\\nunder her dress and carried them one by one to the rocks at the _Anse\\naux Lataniers_, where she placed them in a bark basket and buried them\\nin the sand. The sea was rough and the wind increased from hour to hour.\\nAs a precautionary measure the _Eugène_ had left the roadstead, and\\nMadame Delmare could see in the distance her white sails bellied out by\\nthe breeze, as she stood on and off, making short tacks, in order to\\nhold the land. Her heart went out eagerly toward the vessel, which\\nseemed to be pawing the air impatiently, like a race-horse, full of fire\\nand ardor, as the word is about to be given. But when she returned to\\nthe interior of the island she found in the mountain gorges a calm, soft\\natmosphere, bright sunlight, the song of birds and humming of insects,\\nand everything going on as on the day before, heedless of the intense\\nemotions by which she was tortured. Then she could not believe in the\\nreality of her situation, and wondered if her approaching departure were\\nnot the illusion of a dream.\\n\\nToward night the wind fell. The _Eugène_ approached the shore, and at\\nsunset Madame Delmare on her rocky perch heard the report of a cannon\\nechoing among the cliffs. It was the signal of departure on the\\nfollowing day, on the return of the orb then sinking below the horizon.\\n\\nAfter dinner Monsieur Delmare complained of not feeling well. His wife\\nthought that her opportunity had gone, that he would keep the whole\\nhouse awake all night, and that her plan would be defeated; and then he\\nwas suffering, he needed her; that was not the moment to leave him.\\nThereupon remorse entered her soul and she wondered who would have pity\\non that old man when she had abandoned him. She shuddered at the thought\\nthat she was about to commit what was a crime in her own eyes, and that\\nthe voice of conscience would rise even louder than the voice of\\nsociety, to condemn her. If Delmare, as usual, had harshly demanded her\\nservices, if he had displayed an imperious and capricious spirit in his\\nsufferings, resistance would have seemed natural and lawful to the\\ndown-trodden slave; but, for the first time in his life, he submitted to\\nthe pain with gentleness, and seemed grateful and affectionate to his\\nwife. At ten o\\'clock he declared that he felt entirely well, insisted\\nthat she should go to her own room, and that no one should pay any\\nfurther attention to him. Ralph, too, assured her that every symptom of\\nillness had disappeared and that a quiet night\\'s sleep was the only\\nremedy that he needed.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck eleven all was silent and peaceful in the house.\\nMadame Delmare fell on her knees and prayed, weeping bitterly; for she\\nwas about to burden her heart with a grievous sin, and from God alone\\ncould come such forgiveness as she could hope to receive. She stole\\nsoftly into her husband\\'s room. He was sleeping soundly; his features\\nwere composed, his breathing regular. As she was about to withdraw, she\\nnoticed in the shadows another person asleep in a chair. It was Ralph,\\nwho had risen noiselessly and come to watch over her husband in his\\nsleep, to guard against accident.\\n\\n\"Poor Ralph!\" thought Indiana; \"what an eloquent and cruel reproach to\\nme!\"\\n\\nShe longed to wake him, to confess everything to him, to implore him to\\nsave her from herself; and then she thought of Raymon.\\n\\n\"One more sacrifice,\" she said to herself, \"and the most cruel of\\nall--the sacrifice of my duty.\"\\n\\nLove is woman\\'s virtue; it is for love that she glories in her sins, it\\nis from love that she acquires the heroism to defy her remorse. The more\\ndearly it costs her to commit the crime, the more she will have deserved\\nat the hands of the man she loves. It is like the fanaticism that places\\nthe dagger in the hand of the religious enthusiast.\\n\\nShe took from her neck a gold chain which came to her from her mother\\nand which she had always worn; she gently placed it around Ralph\\'s neck,\\nas the last pledge of an everlasting friendship, then lowered the lamp\\nso that she could see her old husband\\'s face once more, and make sure\\nthat he was no longer ill. He was dreaming at that moment and said in a\\nfaint, sad voice:\\n\\n\"Beware of that man, he will ruin you.\"\\n\\nIndiana shuddered from head to foot and fled to her room. She wrung her\\nhands in pitiable uncertainty; then suddenly seized upon the thought\\nthat she was no longer acting in her own interest but in Raymon\\'s; that\\nshe was going to him, not in search of happiness, but to make him happy,\\nand that, even though she were to be accursed for all eternity, she\\nwould be sufficiently recompensed if she embellished her lover\\'s life.\\nShe rushed from the house and walked swiftly to the _Anse aux\\nLataniers_, not daring to turn and look at what she left behind her.\\n\\nShe at once set about disinterring her bark basket and sat upon it,\\ntrembling and silent, listening to the whistling of the wind, to the\\nplashing of the waves as they died at her feet, and to the shrill\\ngroaning of the _satanite_ among the great bunches of seaweed that clung\\nto the steep sides of the cliffs; but all these noises were drowned by\\nthe throbbing of her heart, which rang in her ears like a funeral knell.\\n\\nShe waited a long while; she looked at her watch and found that the\\nappointed time had passed. The sea was so high, and navigation about the\\nshores of the island is so difficult in the best of weather, that she\\nwas beginning, to despair of the courage of the men who were to take her\\naboard, when she spied on the gleaming waves the black shadow of a\\n_pirogue_, trying to make the land. But the swell was so strong and the\\nsea so rough that the frail craft constantly disappeared, burying itself\\nas it were in the dark folds of a shroud studded with silver stars. She\\nrose and answered their signal several times with cries which the wind\\nwhisked away before carrying them to the ears of the oarsmen. At last,\\nwhen they were near enough to hear her, they pulled toward her with much\\ndifficulty; then paused to wait for a wave. As soon as they felt it\\nraise the skiff they redoubled their efforts, and the wave broke and\\nthrew them up on the beach.\\n\\nThe ground on which Saint-Paul is built is composed of sea sand and\\ngravel from the mountains, which the Des Galets river brings from a long\\ndistance from its mouth by the strength of its current. These heaps of\\nrounded pebbles form submarine mountains near the shore which the waves\\noverthrow and rebuild at their pleasure. Their constant shifting makes\\nit impossible to avoid them, and the skill of the pilot is useless among\\nthese constantly appearing and disappearing obstacles. Large vessels\\nlying in the harbor of Saint-Denis often drag their anchors and are cast\\non shore by the force of the currents; they have no other resource when\\nthis off-shore wind begins to blow, and to make the turbulent receding\\nwaves perilous, than to put to sea as quickly as possible, and that is\\nwhat the _Eugène_ had done.\\n\\nThe skiff bore Indiana and her fortunes amid the wild waves, the howling\\nof the storm and the oaths of the two rowers, who had no hesitation in\\ncursing loudly the danger to which they exposed themselves for her sake.\\nTwo hours ago, they said, the ship should have been under way, and on\\nher account the captain had obstinately refused to give the order. They\\nadded divers insulting and cruel reflections, but the unhappy fugitive\\nconsumed her shame in silence; and when one of them suggested to the\\nother that they might be punished if they were lacking in the respect\\nthey had been ordered to pay the _captain\\'s mistress_:\\n\\n\"Never you fear!\" was the reply; \"the sharks are the lads we\\'ve got to\\nsettle accounts with this night. If we ever see the captain again, I\\ndon\\'t believe he\\'ll be any uglier than them.\"\\n\\n\"Talking of sharks,\" said the first, \"I don\\'t know whether one of \\'em\\nhas got scent of us already, but I can see a face in our wake that don\\'t\\nbelong to a Christian.\"\\n\\n\"You fool! to take a dog\\'s face for a sea-wolf\\'s! Hold! my four-legged\\npassenger, we forgot you and left you on shore; but, blast my eyes, if\\nyou shall eat up the ship\\'s biscuit! Our orders only mentioned a young\\nwoman, nothing was said about a cur----\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he raised his oar to hit the beast on the head; but Madame\\nDelmare, casting her tearful, distraught eyes upon the sea, recognized\\nher beautiful Ophelia, who had found her scent on the rocks and was\\nswimming after her. As the sailor was about to strike her, the waves,\\nagainst which she was struggling painfully, carried her away from the\\nskiff, and her mistress heard her moaning with impatience and\\nexhaustion. She begged the oarsmen to take her into the boat and they\\npretended to comply; but, as the faithful beast approached, they dashed\\nout her brains with loud shouts of laughter, and Indiana saw before her\\nthe dead body of the creature who had loved her better than Raymon. At\\nthe same time a huge wave drew the skiff down as it were into the depths\\nof an abyss, and the laughter of the sailors changed to imprecations and\\nyells of terror. However, thanks to its buoyancy and lightness the\\n_pirogue_ righted itself like a duck and climbed to the summit of the\\nwave, to plunge into another ravine and mount again to another foaming\\ncrest. As they left the shore behind, the sea became less rough, and\\nsoon the skiff flew along swiftly and without danger toward the ship.\\nThereupon, the oarsmen recovered their good humor and with it the power\\nof reflection. They strove to atone for their brutal treatment of\\nIndiana; but their cajolery was more insulting than their anger.\\n\\n\"Come, come, my young lady,\" said one of them, \"take courage, you\\'re\\nsafe now; of course the captain will give us a glass of the best wine in\\nthe locker for the pretty parcel we\\'ve fished up for him.\"\\n\\nThe other affected to sympathize with the young lady because her clothes\\nwere wet; but, he said, the captain was waiting for her and would take\\ngood care of her. Indiana listened to their remarks in deadly terror,\\nwithout speaking or moving; she realized the horror of her situation,\\nand could see no other way of escaping the outrages which awaited her\\nthan to throw herself into the sea. Two or three times she was on the\\npoint of jumping out of the boat; but she recovered courage, a sublime\\ncourage, with the thought:\\n\\n\"It is for him, Raymon, that I suffer all these indignities. I must live\\nthough I were crushed with shame!\"\\n\\nShe put her hand to her oppressed heart and touched the hilt of a dagger\\nwhich she had concealed there in the morning, with a sort of instinctive\\nprevision of danger. The possession of that weapon restored all her\\nconfidence; it was a short, pointed stiletto, which her father used to\\ncarry; an old Spanish weapon which had belonged to a Medina-Sidonia,\\nwhose name was cut on the blade, with the date 1300. Doubtless it had\\nrusted in noble blood, had washed out more than one affront, punished\\nmore than one insolent knave. With it in her possession, Indiana felt\\nthat she became a Spaniard once more, and she went aboard the ship with\\na resolute heart, saying to herself that a woman incurred no risk so\\nlong as she had a sure means of taking her own life before submitting to\\ndishonor. She avenged herself for the harsh treatment of her guides only\\nby rewarding them handsomely for their fatigue; then she went to her\\ncabin and anxiously awaited the hour of departure.\\n\\nAt last the day broke, and the sea was covered with small boats bringing\\nthe passengers aboard. Indiana looked with terror through the port-hole\\nat the faces of those who came aboard the _Eugène_; she dreaded lest\\nshe should see her husband, coming to claim her. At last the echoes of\\nthe last gun died away on the island which had been her prison. The ship\\nbegan to cut her way through the waves, and the sun, rising from the\\nocean, cast its cheerful, rosy light on the white peaks of the Salazes\\nas they sank lower and lower on the horizon.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration 05: _MADAME DELMARE\\'S FLIGHT_\\n_She waited a long while; she looked at her watch\\nand found that the appointed time had passed. The\\nsea was so high, and navigation about the shores of\\nthe island is so difficult in the best of weather, that\\nshe was beginning, to despair of the courage of the\\nmen who were to take her aboard, when she spied on\\nthe gleaming waves the black shadow of a_ pirogue,\\n_trying to make the land._]\\n\\n\\nWhen they were a few leagues from port, a sort of comedy was played on\\nboard to avoid a confession of trickery. Captain Random pretended to\\ndiscover Madame Delmare on his vessel; he feigned surprise, questioned\\nthe sailors, went through the form of losing his temper and of quieting\\ndown again, and ended by drawing up a report of the finding of a\\n_stowaway_ on board; that is the technical term used on such occasions.\\n\\nAllow me to go no farther with the story of this voyage. It will be\\nenough for me to tell you, for Captain Random\\'s justification, that,\\ndespite his rough training, he had enough natural good sense to\\nunderstand Madame Delmare\\'s character very quickly; he ventured upon\\nvery few attempts to abuse her unprotected condition and eventually was\\ntouched by it and acted as her friend and protector. But that worthy\\nman\\'s loyal behavior and Indiana\\'s dignity did not restrain the comments\\nof the crew, the mocking glances, the insulting suspicions and the broad\\nand stinging jests. These were the real torments of the unhappy woman\\nduring that journey, for I say nothing of the fatigue, the discomforts,\\nthe dangers, the tedium and the sea-sickness; she paid no heed to them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\n\\nThree days after the despatch of his letter to Ile Bourbon, Raymon had\\nentirely forgotten both the letter and its purpose. He had felt\\ndecidedly better and had ventured to make a visit in the neighborhood.\\nThe estate of Lagny, which Monsieur Delmare had left to be sold for the\\nbenefit of his creditors, had been purchased by a wealthy manufacturer,\\nMonsieur Hubert, a shrewd and estimable man, not like all wealthy\\nmanufacturers, but like a small number of the newly-rich. Raymon found\\nthe new owner comfortably settled in that house which recalled so many\\nmemories. He took pleasure in giving a free rein to his emotion as he\\nwandered through the garden where Noun\\'s light footprints seemed to be\\nstill visible on the gravel, and through those great rooms which seemed\\nstill to retain the echoes of Indiana\\'s soft words; but soon the\\npresence of a new hostess changed the current of his thoughts.\\n\\nIn the main salon, on the spot where Madame Delmare was accustomed to\\nsit and work, a tall, slender young woman, with a glance that was at\\nonce pleasant and mischievous, caressing and mocking, sat before an\\neasel, amusing herself by copying in water-colors the odd hangings on\\nthe walls. The copy was a fascinating thing, a delicate satire instinct\\nwith the bantering yet refined nature of the artist. She had amused\\nherself by exaggerating the pretentious finicalness of the old frescoes;\\nshe had grasped the false and shifting character of the age of Louis\\nXIV. on those stilted figures. While refreshing the colors that time had\\nfaded, she had restored their affected graces, their perfume of\\ncourtiership, their costumes of the boudoir and the shepherd\\'s hut, so\\ncuriously identical. Beside that work of historical raillery she had\\nwritten the word _copy._\\n\\nShe raised her long eyes, instinct with merriment of a caustic,\\ntreacherous, yet attractive sort, slowly to Raymon\\'s face. For some\\nreason she reminded him of Shakespeare\\'s Anne Page. There was in her\\nmanner neither timidity nor boldness, nor affectation, nor\\nself-distrust. Their conversation turned upon the influence of fashion\\nin the arts.\\n\\n\"Is it not true, monsieur, that the moral coloring of the period was in\\nthat brush?\" she said, pointing to the wainscoting, covered with rustic\\ncupids after the style of Boucher. \"Isn\\'t it true that those sheep do\\nnot walk or sleep or browse like sheep of to-day? And that pretty\\nlandscape, so false and so orderly, those clumps of many-petalled roses\\nin the middle of the forest where naught but a bit of eglantine grows in\\nour days, those tame birds of a species that has apparently disappeared,\\nand those pink satin gowns which the sun never faded--is there not in\\nall these a deal of poesy, ideas of luxury and pleasure, of a whole\\nuseless, harmless, joyous life? Doubtless these absurd fictions were\\nquite as valuable as our gloomy political deliverances! If only I had\\nbeen born in those days!\" she added with a smile; \"frivolous and\\nnarrow-minded creature that I am, I should have been much better fitted\\nto paint fans and produce masterpieces of thread-work than to read the\\nnewspapers and understand the debates in the Chambers!\"\\n\\nMonsieur Hubert left the young people together; and their conversation\\ndrifted from one subject to another, until it fell at last upon Madame\\nDelmare.\\n\\n\"You were very intimate with our predecessors in this house,\" said the\\nyoung woman, \"and it is generous on your part to come and see new faces\\nhere. Madame Delmare,\" she added, with a penetrating glance at him, \"was\\na remarkable woman, so they say; she must have left memories here which\\nplace us at a disadvantage, so far as you are concerned.\"\\n\\n\"She was an excellent woman,\" Raymon replied, unconcernedly, \"and her\\nhusband was a worthy man.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" rejoined the reckless girl, \"she was something more than an\\nexcellent woman, I should judge. If I remember rightly there was a charm\\nabout her personality which calls for a more enthusiastic and more\\npoetic description. I saw her two years ago, at a ball at the Spanish\\nambassador\\'s. She was fascinating that night; do you remember?\"\\n\\nRaymon started at this reminder of the evening that he spoke to Indiana\\nfor the first time. He remembered at the same moment that he had noticed\\nat that ball the distingué features and clever eyes of the young woman\\nwith whom he was now talking; but he did not then ask who she was.\\n\\nNot until he had taken his leave of her and was congratulating Monsieur\\nHubert on his daughter\\'s charms, did he learn her name.\\n\\n\"I have not the good fortune to be her father,\" said the manufacturer;\\n\"but I did the best I could by adopting her. Do you not know my story?\"\\n\\n\"I have been ill for several months,\" Raymon replied, \"and have heard\\nnothing of you beyond the good you have already done in the province.\"\\n\\n\"There are people,\" said Monsieur Hubert with a smile, \"who consider\\nthat I did a most meritorious thing in adopting Mademoiselle de Nangy;\\nbut you, monsieur, who have elevated ideas, will judge whether I did\\nanything more than true delicacy required. Ten years ago, a widower and\\nchildless, I found myself possessed of funds to a considerable amount,\\nthe results of my labors, which I was anxious to invest. I found that\\nthe estate and château of Nangy in Bourgogne, national property, were\\nfor sale and suited me perfectly. I had been in possession some time\\nwhen I learned that the former lord of the manor and his seven-year-old\\ngranddaughter were living in a hovel, in extreme destitution. The old\\nman had received some indemnity, but he had religiously devoted it to\\nthe payment of debts incurred during the emigration. I tried to better\\nhis condition and to give him a home in my house; but he had retained in\\nhis poverty all the pride of his rank. He refused to return to the house\\nof his ancestors as an object of charity, and died shortly after my\\narrival, having steadfastly refused to accept any favors at my hands.\\nThen I took his child there. The little patrician was proud already and\\naccepted my assistance most unwillingly; but at that age prejudices are\\nnot deeply rooted and resolutions do not last long. She soon accustomed\\nherself to look upon me as her father and I brought her up as my own\\ndaughter. She has rewarded me handsomely by the happiness she has\\nshowered on my old age. And so, to make sure of my happiness, I have\\nadopted Mademoiselle de Nangy, and my only hope now is to find her a\\nhusband worthy of her and able to manage prudently the property I shall\\nleave her.\"\\n\\nEncouraged by the interest with which Raymon listened to his\\nconfidences, the excellent man, in true bourgeois fashion, gradually\\nconfided all his business affairs to him. His attentive auditor found\\nthat he had a fine, large fortune administered with the most minute\\ncare, and which simply awaited a younger proprietor, of more fashionable\\ntastes than the worthy Hubert, to shine forth in all its splendor. He\\nfelt that he might be the man destined to perform that agreeable task,\\nand he gave thanks to the ingenious fate which reconciled all his\\ninterests by offering him, by favor of divers romantic incidents, a\\nwoman of his own rank possessed of a fine plebeian fortune. It was a\\nchance not to be let slip, and he put forth all his skill in the effort\\nto grasp it. Moreover, the heiress was charming; Raymon became more\\nkindly disposed toward his providence.\\n\\nAs for Madame Delmare, he would not think of her. He drove away the\\nfears which the thought of his letter aroused from time to time; he\\ntried to persuade himself that poor Indiana would not grasp his meaning\\nor would not have the courage to respond to it; and he finally succeeded\\nin deceiving himself and believing that he was not blameworthy, for\\nRaymon would have been horrified to find that he was selfish. He was not\\none of those artless villains who come on the stage to make a naïve\\nconfession of their vices to their own hearts. Vice is not reflected in\\nits own ugliness, or it would frighten itself; and Shakespeare\\'s Iago,\\nwho is so true to life in his acts, is false in his words, being forced\\nby our stage conventions to lay bare himself the secret recesses of his\\ndeep and tortuous heart. Man rarely tramples his conscience under foot\\nthus coolly. He turns it over, squeezes it, pinches it, disfigures it;\\nand when he has distorted it and exhausted it and worn it out, he\\ncarries it about with him as an indulgent and obliging mentor which\\naccommodates itself to his passions and his interests, but which he\\npretends always to consult and to fear.\\n\\nHe went often to Lagny, therefore, and his visits were agreeable to\\nMonsieur Hubert; for, as you know, Raymon had the art of winning\\naffection, and soon the rich bourgeois\\'s one desire was to call him his\\nson-in-law. But he wished that his adopted daughter should choose him\\nfreely and that they should be allowed every opportunity to know and\\njudge each other.\\n\\nLaure de Nangy was in no haste to assure Raymon\\'s happiness; she kept\\nhim perfectly balanced between fear and hope. Being less generous than\\nMadame Delmare, but more adroit, distant yet flattering, haughty yet\\ncajoling, she was the very woman to subjugate Raymon; for she was as\\nsuperior to him in cunning as he was to Indiana. She soon realized that\\nher admirer craved her fortune much more than herself. Her placid\\nimagination anticipated nothing better in the way of homage; she had too\\nmuch sense, too much knowledge of the world to dream of love when two\\nmillions were at stake. She had chosen her course calmly and\\nphilosophically, and she was not inclined to blame Raymon; she did not\\nhate him because he was of a calculating, unsentimental temper like the\\nage in which he lived; but she knew him too well to love him. She made\\nit a matter of pride not to fall below the standard of that cold and\\nscheming epoch; her self-esteem would have suffered had she been swayed\\nby the foolish illusions of an ignorant boarding-school miss; she would\\nhave blushed at being deceived as at being detected in a foolish act; in\\na word, she made her heroism consist in steering clear of love, as\\nMadame Delmare\\'s consisted in sacrificing everything to it.\\n\\nMademoiselle de Nangy was fully resolved, therefore, to submit to\\nmarriage as a social necessity; but she took a malicious pleasure in\\nmaking use of the liberty which still belonged to her, and in imposing\\nher authority for some time on the man who aspired to deprive her of it.\\nNo youth, no sweet dreams, no brilliant and deceptive future for that\\ngirl, who was doomed to undergo all the miseries of wealth. For her,\\nlife was a matter of stoical calculation, happiness a childish delusion\\nagainst which she must defend herself as a weakness and an absurdity.\\n\\nWhile Raymon was at work building up his fortune, Indiana was drawing\\nnear the shores of France. But imagine her surprise and alarm, when she\\nlanded, to see the tri-colored flag floating on the walls of Bordeaux!\\nThe city was in a state of violent agitation; the prefect had been\\nalmost murdered the night before; the populace were rising on all sides;\\nthe garrison seemed to be preparing for a bloody conflict, and the\\nresult of the revolution was still unknown.\\n\\n\"I have come too late!\" was the thought that fell upon Madame Delmare\\nlike a stroke of lightning.\\n\\nIn her alarm she left on board the little money and the few clothes that\\nshe possessed, and ran about through the city in a state of frenzy. She\\ntried to find a diligence for Paris, but the public conveyances were\\ncrowded with people who were either escaping or going to claim a share\\nin the spoils of the vanquished. Not until evening did she succeed in\\nfinding a place. As she was stepping into the coach an improvised patrol\\nof National Guards objected to the departure of the passengers and\\ndemanded to see their papers. Indiana had none. While she argued against\\nthe absurd suspicions of the triumphant party, she heard it stated all\\nabout her that the monarchy had fallen, that the king was a fugitive,\\nand that the ministers had been massacred with all their adherents. This\\nnews, proclaimed with laughter and stamping and shouts of joy, dealt\\nMadame Delmare a deadly blow. In the whole revolution she was personally\\ninterested in but one fact; in all France she knew but one man. She fell\\non the ground in a swoon, and came to herself in a hospital--several\\ndays later.\\n\\nAfter two months she was discharged, without money or linen or effects,\\nweak and trembling, exhausted by an inflammatory brain fever which had\\ncaused her life to be despaired of several times. When she found herself\\nin the street, alone, hardly able to walk, without friends, resources or\\nstrength, when she made an effort to recall the particulars of her\\nsituation and realized that she was hopelessly lost in that great city,\\nshe had an indescribable thrill of terror and despair as she thought\\nthat Raymon\\'s fate had long since been decided and that there was not a\\nsolitary person about her who could put an end to her horrible\\nuncertainty. The horror of desertion bore down with all its might upon\\nher crushed spirit, and the apathetic despair born of hopeless misery\\ngradually deadened all her faculties. In the mental numbness which she\\nfelt stealing over her, she dragged herself to the harbor, and,\\nshivering with fever, sat down on a stone to warm herself in the\\nsunshine, gazing listlessly at the water plashing at her feet. She sat\\nthere several hours, devoid of energy, of hope, of purpose; but suddenly\\nshe remembered her clothes and her money, which she had left on the\\n_Eugène_, and which she might possibly recover; but it was nightfall,\\nand she dared not go among the sailors who were just leaving their work\\nwith much rough merriment and question them concerning the ship.\\nDesiring, on the other hand, to avoid the attention she was beginning to\\nattract, she left the quay and concealed herself in the ruins of a house\\nrecently demolished behind the great esplanade of Les Quinconces. There,\\ncowering in a corner, she passed that cold October night, a night laden\\nwith bitter thoughts and alarms. At last the day broke; hunger made\\nitself felt insistent and implacable. She decided to ask alms. Her\\nclothes, although in wretched condition, still indicated more\\ncomfortable circumstances than a beggar is supposed to enjoy. People\\nlooked at her curiously, suspiciously, ironically, and gave her nothing.\\nAgain she dragged herself to the quays, inquired about the _Eugène_ and\\nlearned from the first waterman she addressed that she was still in the\\nroadstead. She hired him to put her aboard and found Random at\\nbreakfast.\\n\\n\"Well, well, my fair passenger,\" he cried, \"so you have returned from\\nParis already! You have come in good time, for I sail to-morrow. Shall I\\ntake you back to Bourbon?\"\\n\\nHe informed Madame Delmare that he had caused search to be made for her\\neverywhere, that he might return what belonged to her. But Indiana had\\nnot a scrap of paper upon her from which her name could be learned when\\nshe was taken to the hospital. She had been entered on the books there\\nand also on the police books under the designation _unknown_; so the\\ncaptain had been unable to learn anything about her.\\n\\nThe next day, despite her weakness and exhaustion, Indiana started for\\nParis. Her anxiety should have diminished when she saw the turn\\npolitical affairs had taken; but anxiety does not reason, and love is\\nfertile in childish fears.\\n\\nOn the very evening of her arrival at Paris she hurried to Raymon\\'s\\nhouse and questioned the concierge in an agony of apprehension.\\n\\n\"Monsieur is quite well,\" was the reply; \"he is at Lagny.\"\\n\\n\"At Lagny! you mean at Cercy, do you not?\"\\n\\n\"No, madame, at Lagny, which he owns now.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Raymon!\" thought Indiana, \"he has bought that estate to afford me\\na refuge where public malice cannot reach me. He knew that I would\\ncome!\"\\n\\nDrunk with joy, she hastened, light of heart and instinct with new life,\\nto take apartments in a furnished house, and devoted the night and part\\nof the next day to rest. It was so long since the unfortunate creature\\nhad enjoyed a peaceful sleep! Her dreams were sweet and deceptive, and\\nwhen she woke she did not regret them, for she found hope at her pillow.\\nShe dressed with care; she knew that Raymon was particular about all the\\nminutiæ of the toilet, and she had ordered the night before a pretty\\nnew dress which was brought to her just as she rose. But, when she was\\nready to arrange her hair, she sought in vain the long and magnificent\\ntresses she had once had; during her illness they had fallen under the\\nnurse\\'s shears. She noticed it then for the first time, her\\nall-engrossing thoughts had diverted her mind so completely from small\\nthings.\\n\\nNevertheless, when she had curled her short black locks about her pale\\nand melancholy brow, when she had placed upon her shapely head a little\\nEnglish hat, called then, by way of allusion to the recent blow to great\\nfortunes, a _three per cent._; when she had fastened at her girdle a\\nbunch of the flowers whose perfume Raymon loved, she hoped that she\\nwould still find favor in his sight; for she was as pale and fragile as\\nin the first days of their acquaintance, and the effect of her illness\\nhad effaced the traces of the tropical sunshine.\\n\\nShe hired a cab in the afternoon and arrived about nine at night at a\\nvillage on the outskirts of Fontainebleau. There she ordered the driver\\nto put up his horse and wait for her until the next day, and started off\\nalone, on foot, by a path which led to Lagny park by a walk of less than\\nquarter of an hour through the woods. She tried to open the small gate\\nbut found it locked on the inside. It was her wish to enter by stealth,\\nto avoid the eyes of the servants and take Raymon by surprise. She\\nskirted the park wall. It was quite old; she remembered that there were\\nfrequent breaches, and, by good luck, she found one and passed over\\nwithout much difficulty.\\n\\nWhen she stood upon ground which belonged to Raymon and was to be\\nthenceforth her refuge, her sanctuary, her fortress and her home, her\\nheart leaped for joy. With light, triumphant foot she hastened along the\\nwinding paths she knew so well. She reached the English garden, which\\nwas dark and deserted on that side. Nothing was changed in the\\nflower-beds; but the bridge, the painful sight of which she dreaded, had\\ndisappeared, and the course of the stream had been altered; the spots\\nwhich might have recalled Noun\\'s death had been changed, and no others.\\n\\n\"He wished to banish that cruel memory,\" thought Indiana. \"He was wrong,\\nI could have endured it. Was it not for my sake that he planted the\\nseeds of remorse in his life? Henceforth we are quits, for I too have\\ncommitted a crime. I may have caused my husband\\'s death. Raymon can open\\nhis arms to me, we will take the place of innocence and virtue to each\\nother.\"\\n\\nShe crossed the stream on boards laid across where a bridge was to be\\nbuilt and passed through the flower-garden. She was forced to stop, for\\nher heart was beating as if it would burst; she looked up at the windows\\nof her old bedroom. O bliss! a light was shining through the blue\\ncurtains, Raymon was there. As if he could occupy any other room! The\\ndoor to the secret stairway was open.\\n\\n\"He expects me at any time,\" she thought; \"he will be happy but not\\nsurprised.\"\\n\\nAt the top of the staircase she paused again to take breath; she felt\\nless strong to endure joy than sorrow. She stooped and looked through\\nthe keyhole. Raymon was alone, reading. It was really he, it was Raymon\\noverflowing with life and vigor; his trials had not aged him, the\\ntempests of politics had not taken a single hair from his head; there he\\nsat, placid and handsome, his head resting on his white hand which was\\nburied in his black hair.\\n\\nIndiana impulsively tried the door, which opened without resistance.\\n\\n\"You expected me!\" she cried, falling on her knees and resting her\\nfeeble head upon Raymon\\'s bosom; \"you counted the months and days, you\\nknew that the time had passed, but you knew too that I could not fail to\\ncome at your call. You called me and I am here, I am here! I am dying!\"\\n\\nHer ideas became tangled in her brain; for some time she knelt there,\\nsilent, gasping for breath, incapable of speech or thought. Then she\\nopened her eyes, recognized Raymon as if just waking from a dream,\\nuttered a cry of frantic joy, and pressed her lips to his, wild, ardent\\nand happy. He was pale, dumb, motionless, as if struck by lightning.\\n\\n\"Speak to me, in Heaven\\'s name,\" she cried; \"it is I, your Indiana, your\\nslave whom you recalled from exile and who has travelled three thousand\\nleagues to love you and serve you; it is your chosen companion, who has\\nleft everything, risked everything, defied everything, to bring you this\\nmoment of joy! You are happy, you are content with her, are you not? I\\nam waiting for my reward; with a word, a kiss I shall be paid a hundred\\nfold.\"\\n\\nBut Raymon did not reply; his admirable presence of mind had abandoned\\nhim. He was crushed with surprise, remorse and terror when he saw that\\nwoman at his feet; he hid his face in his hands and longed for death.\\n\\n\"My God! my God! you don\\'t speak to me, you don\\'t kiss me, you have\\nnothing to say to me!\" cried Madame Delmare, pressing Raymon\\'s knees to\\nher breast; \"is it because you cannot? Joy makes people ill, it kills\\nsometimes, I know! Ah! you are not well, you are suffocating, I\\nsurprised you too suddenly! Try to look at me; see how pale I am, how\\nold I have grown, how I have suffered! But it was for you, and you will\\nlove me all the better for it! Say one word to me, Raymon, just one.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to weep,\" said Raymon in a stifled tone.\\n\\n\"And so would I,\" said she, covering his hands with kisses. \"Ah! yes,\\nthat would do you good. Weep, weep on my bosom, and I will wipe your\\ntears away with my kisses. I have come to bring you happiness, to be\\nwhatever you choose--your companion, your servant or your mistress.\\nFormerly I was very cruel, very foolish, very selfish. I made you suffer\\nterribly, and I refused to understand that I demanded what was beyond\\nyour strength. But since then I have reflected, and as you are not\\nafraid to defy public opinion with me, I have no right to refuse to make\\nany sacrifice. Dispose of me, of my blood, of my life, as you will; I am\\nyours body and soul. I have travelled three thousand leagues to tell you\\nthis, to give myself to you. Take me, I am your property, you are my\\nmaster.\"\\n\\nI cannot say what infernal project passed rapidly through Raymon\\'s\\nbrain. He removed his clenched hands from his face and looked at Indiana\\nwith diabolical _sang-froid_; then a wicked smile played about his lips\\nand made his eyes gleam, for Indiana was still lovely.\\n\\n\"First of all, we must conceal you,\" he said, rising.\\n\\n\"Why conceal me here?\" she said; \"aren\\'t you at liberty to take me in\\nand protect me, who have no one but you on earth, and who, without you,\\nshall be compelled to beg on the public highway? Why, even society can\\nno longer call it a crime for you to love me; I have taken everything on\\nmy own shoulders! But where are you going?\" she cried, as she saw him\\nwalking toward the door.\\n\\nShe clung to him with the terror of a child who does not wish to be left\\nalone a single instant, and dragged herself along on her knees behind\\nhim.\\n\\nHis purpose was to lock the door; but he was too late. The door opened\\nbefore he could reach it, and Laure de Nangy entered. She seemed less\\nsurprised than exasperated, and did not utter an exclamation, but\\nstooped a little to look with snapping eyes at the half-fainting woman\\non the floor; then, with a cold, bitter, scornful smile, she said:\\n\\n\"Madame Delmare, you seem to enjoy placing three persons in a very\\nstrange situation; but I thank you for assigning me the least ridiculous\\nrôle of the three, and this is how I discharge it. Be good enough to\\nretire.\"\\n\\nIndignation renewed Indiana\\'s strength; she rose and drew herself up to\\nher full height.\\n\\n\"Who is this woman, pray?\" she said to Raymon, \"and by what right does\\nshe give me orders in your house?\"\\n\\n\"You are in my house, madame,\" retorted Laure.\\n\\n\"Speak, in heaven\\'s name, monsieur,\" cried Indiana fiercely, shaking the\\nwretched man\\'s arm; \"tell me whether she is your mistress or your wife!\"\\n\\n\"She is my wife,\" Raymon replied with a dazed air.\\n\\n\"I forgive your uncertainty,\" said Madame de Ramière with a cruel\\nsmile. \"If you had remained where your duty required you to remain, you\\nwould have received cards to monsieur\\'s marriage. Come, Raymon,\" she\\nadded in a tone of sarcastic amiability, \"I am moved to pity by your\\nembarrassment. You are rather young; you will realize now, I trust, that\\nmore prudence is advisable. I leave it for you to put an end to this\\nabsurd scene. I would laugh at it if you didn\\'t look so utterly\\nwretched.\"\\n\\nWith that she withdrew, well satisfied with the dignity she had\\ndisplayed, and secretly triumphant because the incident had placed her\\nhusband in a position of inferiority and dependence with regard to her.\\n\\nWhen Indiana recovered the use of her faculties she was alone in a close\\ncarriage, being driven rapidly toward Paris.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIX\\n\\n\\nThe carriage stopped at the barrier. A servant whom Madame Delmare\\nrecognized as a man who had formerly been in Raymon\\'s service came to\\nthe door and asked where he should leave _madame_. Indiana instinctively\\ngave the name and street number of the lodging-house at which she had\\nslept the night before. On arriving there, she fell into a chair and\\nremained there until morning, without a thought of going to bed, without\\nmoving, longing for death but too crushed, too inert to summon strength\\nto kill herself. She believed that it was impossible to live after such\\nterrible blows, and that death would of its own motion come in search of\\nher. She remained there all the following day, taking no sustenance,\\nmaking no reply to the offers of service that were made her.\\n\\nI do not know that there is anything more horrible on earth than life in\\na furnished lodging-house in Paris, especially when it is situated, as\\nthis one was, in a dark, narrow street, and only a dull, hazy light\\ncrawls regretfully, as it were, over the smoky ceilings and soiled\\nwindows. And then there is something chilly and repellent in the sight\\nof the furniture to which you are unaccustomed and to which your idle\\nglance turns in vain for a memory, a touch of sympathy. All those\\nobjects which belong, so to speak, to no one, because they belong to all\\ncomers; that room where no one has left any trace of his passage save\\nnow and then a strange name, found on a card in the mirror-frame; that\\nmercenary roof, which has sheltered so many poor travellers, so many\\nlonely strangers, with hospitality for none; which looks with\\nindifference upon so many human agitations and can describe none of\\nthem: the discordant, never-ending noise from the street, which does not\\neven allow you to sleep and thus escape grief or ennui: all these are\\ncauses of disgust and irritation even to one who does not bring to the\\nhorrible place such a frame of mind as Madame Delmare\\'s. You ill-starred\\nprovincial, who have left your fields, your blue sky, your verdure, your\\nhouse and your family, to come and shut yourself up in this dungeon of\\nthe mind and the heart--see Paris, lovely Paris, which in your dreams\\nhas seemed to you such a marvel of beauty! see it stretch away yonder,\\nblack with mud and rainy, as noisy and pestilent and rapid as a torrent\\nof slime! There is the perpetual revel, always brilliant and perfumed,\\nwhich was promised you; there are the intoxicating pleasures, the\\nwonderful surprises, the treasures of sight and taste and hearing which\\nwere to contend for the possession of your passions and faculties, which\\nare of limited capacity and powerless to enjoy them all at once! See,\\nyonder, the affable, winning, hospitable Parisian, as he was described\\nto you, always in a hurry, always careworn! Tired out before you have\\nseen the whole of this ever-moving population, this inextricable\\nlabyrinth, you take refuge, overwhelmed with dismay, in the cheerful\\nprecincts of a furnished lodging-house, where, after hastily installing\\nyou, the only servant of a house that is often of immense size leaves\\nyou to die in peace, if fatigue or sorrow deprive you of the strength to\\nattend to the thousand necessities of life.\\n\\nBut to be a woman and to find oneself in such a place, spurned by\\neverybody, three thousand leagues from all human affection; to be\\nwithout money, which is much worse than being abandoned in a vast desert\\nwithout water; to have in all one\\'s past not a single happy memory that\\nis not poisoned or withered, in the whole future not a single hope to\\ndivert one\\'s thoughts from the emptiness of the present, is the last\\ndegree of misery and hopelessness. And so Madame Delmare, making no\\nattempt to contend against a destiny that was fulfilled, against a\\nbroken, ruined life, submitted to the gnawings of hunger, fever and\\nsorrow without uttering a complaint, without shedding a tear, without\\nmaking an effort to die an hour earlier, to suffer an hour less.\\n\\nThey found her on the morning of the second day, lying on the floor,\\nstiff with cold, with clenched teeth, blue lips and lustreless eyes; but\\nshe was not dead. The landlady examined her secretary and, seeing how\\npoorly supplied it was, considered whether the hospital was not the\\nproper place for this stranger, who certainly had not the means to pay\\nthe expenses of a long and costly illness. However, as she was a woman\\n_overflowing with humanity_, she caused her to be put to bed and sent\\nfor a doctor to ascertain if the illness would last more than a day or\\ntwo.\\n\\nA doctor appeared who had not been sent for. Indiana, on opening her\\neyes, found him beside her bed. I need not tell you his name.\\n\\n\"Oh! you here! you here!\" she cried, throwing herself, almost fainting,\\non his breast. \"You are my good angel! But you come too late, and I can\\ndo nothing for you except to die blessing you.\"\\n\\n\"You will not die, my dear,\" replied Ralph with deep emotion; \"life may\\nstill smile upon you. The laws which interfered with your happiness no\\nlonger fetter your affection. I would have preferred to destroy the\\ninvincible spell which a man whom I neither like nor esteem has cast\\nupon you; but that is not in my power, and I am tired of seeing you\\nsuffer. Hitherto your life has been perfectly frightful; it cannot be\\nmore so. Besides, even if my gloomy forebodings are realized and the\\nhappiness of which you have dreamed is destined to be of short duration,\\nyou will at least have enjoyed it for some little time, you will not die\\nwithout a taste of it. So I sacrifice all my repugnance and dislike. The\\ndestiny which casts you, all alone as you are, into my arms, imposes\\nupon me the duties of a father and a guardian toward you. I come to tell\\nyou that you are free and that you may unite your lot to Monsieur de\\nRamière\\'s. Delmare is no more.\"\\n\\nTears rolled slowly down Ralph\\'s cheeks while he was speaking. Indiana\\nsuddenly sat up in bed and cried, wringing her hands in despair:\\n\\n\"My husband is dead! and it was I who killed him! And you talk to me of\\nthe future and happiness, as if such a thing were possible for the heart\\nthat detests and despises itself! But be sure that God is just and that\\nI am cursed. Monsieur de Ramière is married.\"\\n\\nShe fell back, utterly exhausted, into her cousin\\'s arms. They were\\nunable to resume conversation until several hours later.\\n\\n\"Your justly disturbed conscience may be set at rest,\" said Ralph, in a\\nsolemn, but sad and gentle tone. \"Delmare was at death\\'s door when you\\ndeserted him: he did not wake from the sleep in which you left him, he\\nnever knew of your flight, he died without cursing you or weeping for\\nyou. Toward morning, when I woke from the heavy sleep into which I had\\nfallen beside his bed, I found his face purple and he was burning hot\\nand breathing stertorously in his sleep; he was already stricken with\\napoplexy. I ran to your room and was surprised not to find you there;\\nbut I had no time to try to discover the explanation of your absence; I\\nwas not seriously alarmed about it until after Delmare\\'s death.\\nEverything that skill could do was of no avail, the disease progressed\\nwith startling rapidity, and he died an hour later, in my arms, without\\nrecovering the use of his senses. At the last moment, however, his\\nbenumbed, clouded mind seemed to make an effort to come to life; he felt\\nfor my hand which he took for yours--his were already stiff and numb--he\\ntried to press it, and died, stammering your name.\"\\n\\n\"I heard his last words,\" said Indiana gloomily; \"at the moment that I\\nleft him forever, he spoke to me in his sleep. \\'That man will ruin you,\\'\\nhe said. Those words are here,\" she added, putting one hand to her heart\\nand the other to her head.\\n\\n\"When I succeeded in taking my eyes and my thoughts from that dead\\nbody,\" continued Ralph, \"I thought of you; of you, Indiana, who were\\nfree thenceforth, and who could not weep for your master unless from\\nkindness of heart or religious feeling. I was the only one whom his\\ndeath deprived of something, for I was his friend, and, even if he was\\nnot always very sociable, at all events I had no rival in his heart. I\\nfeared the effect of breaking the news to you too suddenly, and I went\\nto the door to wait for you, thinking that you would soon return from\\nyour morning walk. I waited a long while. I will not attempt to describe\\nmy anxiety, my search, and my alarm when I found Ophelia\\'s body, all\\nbleeding and bruised by the rocks; the waves had washed it upon the\\nbeach. I looked a long while, alas! expecting to discover yours; for I\\nthought that you had taken your own life, and for three days I believed\\nthat there was nothing left on earth for me to love. It is useless to\\nspeak of my grief; you must have foreseen it when you abandoned me.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile, a rumor that you had fled spread swiftly through the colony.\\nA vessel came into port that had passed the _Eugène_ in Mozambique\\nChannel; some of the ship\\'s company had been aboard your ship. A\\npassenger had recognized you, and in less than three days the whole\\nisland knew of your departure.\\n\\n\"I spare you the absurd and insulting reports that resulted from the\\ncoincidence of those two events on the same night, your flight and your\\nhusband\\'s death. I was not spared in the charitable conclusions that\\npeople amused themselves by drawing; but I paid no attention to them. I\\nhad still one duty to perform on earth, to make sure of your welfare and\\nto lend you a helping hand if necessary. I sailed soon after you; but I\\nhad a horrible voyage and have been in France only a week. My first\\nthought was to go to Monsieur de Ramière to inquire about you; but by\\ngood luck I met his servant Carle, who had just brought you here. I\\nasked him no questions except where you were living, and I came here\\nwith the conviction that I should not find you alone.\"\\n\\n\"Alone, alone! shamefully abandoned!\" cried Madame Delmare. \"But let us\\nnot speak of that man, let us never speak of him. I can never love him\\nagain, for I despise him; but you must not tell me that I once loved\\nhim, for that reminds me of my shame and my crime; it casts a terrible\\nreproach upon my last moments. Ah! be my angel of consolation; you who\\nnever fail to come and offer me a friendly hand in all the crises of my\\nmiserable life. Fulfil with pity your last mission; say to me words of\\naffection and forgiveness, so that I may die at peace, and hope for\\npardon from the Judge who awaits me on high.\"\\n\\nShe hoped to die; but grief rivets the chain of life instead of breaking\\nit. She was not even dangerously ill; she simply had no strength, and\\nlapsed into a state of languor and apathy which resembled imbecility.\\n\\nRalph tried to distract her; he took her away from everything that could\\nremind her of Raymon. He took her to Touraine, he surrounded her with\\nall the comforts of life; he devoted all his time to making a portion of\\nhers endurable; and when he failed, when he had exhausted all the\\nresources of his art and his affection without bringing a feeble gleam\\nof pleasure to that gloomy, careworn face, he deplored the powerlessness\\nof his words and blamed himself bitterly for the ineptitude of his\\naffection.\\n\\nOne day he found her more crushed and hopeless than ever. He dared not\\nspeak to her, but sat down beside her with a melancholy air. Thereupon,\\nIndiana turned to him and said, pressing his hand tenderly:\\n\\n\"I cause you a vast deal of pain, poor Ralph! and you must be patient\\nbeyond words to endure the spectacle of such egotistical, cowardly\\nmisery as mine! Your unpleasant task was finished long ago. The most\\ninsanely exacting woman could not ask of friendship more than you have\\ndone for me. Now leave me to the misery that is gnawing at my heart; do\\nnot spoil your pure and holy life by contact with an accursed life; try\\nto find elsewhere the happiness which cannot exist near me.\"\\n\\n\"I do in fact give up all hope of curing you, Indiana,\" he replied; \"but\\nI will never abandon you even if you should tell me that I annoy you;\\nfor you still require bodily care, and if you are not willing that I\\nshould be your friend, I will at all events be your servant. But listen\\nto me; I have an expedient to propose to you which I have kept in\\nreserve for the last stage of the disease, but which certainly is\\ninfallible.\"\\n\\n\"I know but one remedy for sorrow,\" she replied, \"and that is\\nforgetting; for I have had time to convince myself that argument is\\nunavailing. Let us hope everything from time, therefore. If my will\\ncould obey the gratitude which you inspire in me, I should be now as\\ncheerful and calm as in the days of our childhood; believe me, my\\nfriend, I take no pleasure in nourishing my trouble and inflaming my\\nwound; do I not know that all my sufferings rebound on your heart? Alas!\\nI would like to forget, to be cured! but I am only a weak woman. Ralph,\\nbe patient and do not think me ungrateful.\"\\n\\nShe burst into tears. Sir Ralph took her hand.\\n\\n\"Listen, dear Indiana,\" he said; \"to forget is not in our power; I do\\nnot accuse you! I can suffer patiently; but to see you suffer is beyond\\nmy strength. Indeed, why should we struggle thus, weak creatures that we\\nare, against a destiny of iron? It is quite enough to drag this\\ncannon-ball; the God whom you and I adore did not condemn man to undergo\\nso much misery without giving him the instinct to escape from it; and\\nwhat constitutes, in my opinion, man\\'s most marked superiority over the\\nbrute is his ability to understand what the remedy is for all his ills.\\nThe remedy is suicide; that is what I propose, what I advise.\"\\n\\n\"I have often thought of it,\" Indiana replied after a short silence.\\n\"Long ago I was violently tempted to resort to it, but religious\\nscruples arrested me. Since then my ideas have reached a higher level,\\nin solitude. Misfortune clung to me and gradually taught me a different\\nreligion from that taught by men. When you came to my assistance I had\\ndetermined to allow myself to die of hunger; but you begged me to live,\\nand I had not the right to refuse you that sacrifice. Now, what holds me\\nback is your existence, your future. What will you do all alone, poor\\nRalph, without family, without passions, without affections? Since I\\nhave received these horrible wounds in my heart I am no longer good for\\nanything to you; but perhaps I shall recover. Yes, Ralph, I will do my\\nutmost, I swear. Have patience a little longer; soon, perhaps, I shall\\nbe able to smile. I long to become tranquil and light-hearted once more\\nin order to devote to you this life for which you have fought so stoutly\\nwith misfortune.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, no; I do not desire such a sacrifice; I will never accept\\nit,\" said Ralph. \"Wherein is my life more precious than yours, pray? Why\\nmust you inflict a hateful future upon yourself in order that mine may\\nbe pleasant? Do you think that it will be possible for me to enjoy it\\nwhile feeling that your heart has no share in it? No, I am not so\\nselfish as that. Let us not attempt, I beg you, an impossible heroism;\\nit is overweening pride and presumption to hope to renounce all\\nself-love thus. Let us view our situation calmly and dispose of our\\nremaining days as common property which neither of us has the right to\\nappropriate at the other\\'s expense. For a long time, ever since my\\nbirth, I may say, life has been a bore and a burden to me; now I no\\nlonger feel the courage to endure it without bitterness of heart and\\nimpiety. Let us go together; let us return to God, who exiled us in this\\nworld of trials, in this vale of tears, but who will surely not refuse\\nto open His arms to us when, bruised and weary, we go to Him and implore\\nHis indulgence and His mercy. I believe in God, Indiana, and it was I\\nwho first taught you to believe in Him. So have confidence in me; an\\nupright heart cannot deceive one who questions it with sincerity. I feel\\nthat we have both suffered enough here on earth to be cleansed of our\\nsins. The baptism of unhappiness has surely purified our souls\\nsufficiently; let us give them back to Him who gave them.\"\\n\\nThis idea engrossed Ralph and Indiana for several days, at the end of\\nwhich it was decided that they should commit suicide together. It only\\nremained to choose what sort of death they would die.\\n\\n\"It is a matter of some importance,\" said Ralph; \"but I have already\\nconsidered it, and this is what I have to suggest. The act that we are\\nabout to undertake not being the result of a momentary mental\\naberration, but of a deliberate determination formed after calm and\\npious reflection, it is important that we should bring to it the\\nmeditative seriousness of a Catholic receiving the sacraments of his\\nChurch. For us the universe is the temple in which we adore God. In the\\nbosom of majestic, virgin nature we are impressed by the consciousness\\nof His power, pure of all human profanation. Let us go back to the\\ndesert, therefore, so that we may be able to pray. Here, in this country\\nswarming with men and vices, in the bosom of this civilization which\\ndenies God or disfigures Him, I feel that I should be ill at ease,\\ndistraught and depressed. I would like to die cheerfully, with a serene\\nbrow and with my eyes gazing heavenward. But where can we find heaven\\nhere? I will tell you, therefore, the spot where suicide appeared to me\\nin its noblest and most solemn aspect. It is in Ile Bourbon, on the\\nverge of a precipice, on the summit of the cliff from which the\\ntransparent cascade, surmounted by a gorgeous rainbow, plunges into the\\nlonely ravine of Bernica. That is where we passed the sweetest hours of\\nour childhood; that is where I bewailed the bitterest sorrows of my\\nlife; that is where I learned to pray, to hope; that is where I would\\nlike, during one of the lovely nights of that latitude, to bury myself\\nin those pure waters and go down into the cool, flower-decked grave\\nformed by the depths of the verdure-lined abyss. If you have no\\npredilection for any other spot, give me the satisfaction of offering up\\nour twofold sacrifice on the spot which witnessed the games of our\\nchildhood and the sorrows of our youth.\"\\n\\n\"I agree,\" said Madame Delmare, placing her hand in Ralph\\'s to seal the\\ncompact. \"I have always been drawn to the banks of the stream by an\\ninvincible attraction, by the memory of my poor Noun. To die as she died\\nwill be sweet to me; it will be an atonement for her death, which I\\ncaused.\"\\n\\n\"Moreover,\" said Ralph, \"another sea voyage, made under the influence of\\nother feelings than those which have agitated us hitherto, is the best\\npreparation we could imagine for communing with ourselves, for detaching\\nourselves from earthly affections, for raising ourselves in unalloyed\\npurity to the feet of the Supreme Being. Isolated from the whole world,\\nalways ready to leave this life with glad hearts, we shall watch with\\nenchanted eyes the tempest arouse the elements and unfold its\\nmagnificent spectacles before us. Come, Indiana, let us go; let us shake\\nthe dust of this ungrateful land from our feet. To die here, under\\nRaymon\\'s eyes, would be to all appearance a mere commonplace, cowardly\\nrevenge. Let us leave that man\\'s punishment to God; and let us go and\\nbeseech Him to open the treasures of His mercy to that barren and\\nungrateful heart.\"\\n\\nThey left France. The schooner _Nahandove_, as fleet and nimble as a\\nbird, bore them to their twice-abandoned country. Never was there so\\npleasant and fast a passage. It seemed as if a favorable wind had\\nundertaken to guide safely into port those two ill-fated beings who had\\nbeen tossed about so long among the reefs and shoals of life. During\\nthose three months Indiana reaped the fruit of her docile compliance\\nwith Ralph\\'s advice. The sea air, so bracing and so penetrating,\\nrestored her impaired health; a wave of peace overflowed her wearied\\nheart. The certainty that she would soon have done with her sufferings\\nproduced upon her the effect of a doctor\\'s assurances upon a credulous\\npatient. Forgetting her past life, she opened her heart to the profound\\nemotions of religious hope. Her thoughts were all impregnated with a\\nmysterious charm, a celestial perfume. Never had the sea and sky seemed\\nto her so beautiful. It seemed to her that she saw them for the first\\ntime, she discovered so many new splendors and glories in them. Her brow\\nbecame serene once more, and one would have said that a ray of the\\nDivine essence had passed into her sweetly melancholy eyes.\\n\\nA change no less extraordinary took place in Ralph\\'s soul and in his\\noutward aspect; the same causes produced almost the same results. His\\nheart, so long hardened against sorrow, softened in the revivifying\\nwarmth of hope. Heaven descended also into that bitter, wounded heart.\\nHis words took on the stamp of his feelings and for the first time\\nIndiana became acquainted with his real character. The reverent, filial\\nintimacy that bound them together took from the one his painful shyness,\\nfrom the other her unjust prejudices. Every day cured Ralph of some\\n_gaucherie_ of his nature, Indiana of some error of her judgment. At the\\nsame time the painful memory of Raymon faded away and gradually vanished\\nin face of Ralph\\'s unsuspected virtues, his sublime sincerity. As the\\none grew greater in her estimation, the other fell away. At last, by\\ndint of comparing the two men, every vestige of her blind and fatal love\\nwas effaced from her heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXX\\n\\n\\nIt was last year, one evening during the never-ending summer that reigns\\nin those latitudes, that two passengers from the schooner _Nahandove_\\njourneyed into the mountains of Ile Bourbon three days after landing.\\nThese two persons had devoted the interval to repose, a precaution quite\\ninconsistent with the plan which had brought them to the colony. But\\nsuch was evidently not their opinion; for, after taking _faham_ together\\non the veranda, they dressed with especial care as if they intended to\\npass the evening in society, and, taking the road to the mountain, they\\nreached the ravine of Bernica after about an hour\\'s walk.\\n\\nChance willed that it should be one of the loveliest evenings for which\\nthe moon ever furnished light in the tropics. That luminary had just\\nrisen from the dark waves and was beginning to cast a long band of\\nquick-silver on the sea; but its rays did not shine into the gorge, and\\nthe edges of the basin reflected only the trembling gleam of a few\\nstars. Even the lemon-trees on the higher slopes of the mountain were\\nnot covered with the pale diamonds with which the moon sprinkles their\\npolished, brittle leaves. The ebony trees and the tamarinds murmured\\nsoftly in the darkness; only the bushy tufts at the summit of the huge\\npalm-trees, whose slender trunks rose a hundred feet from the ground,\\nshone with a greenish tinge in the silvery beams.\\n\\nThe sea-birds were resting quietly in the crevices of the cliffs, and\\nonly a few blue pigeons, concealed behind the projections of the\\nmountain, raised their melancholy, passionate note in the distance.\\nLovely beetles, living jewels, rustled gently in the branches of the\\ncoffee-trees, or skimmed the surface of the lake with a buzzing noise,\\nand the regular plashing of the cascade seemed to exchange mysterious\\nwords with the echoes on its shores.\\n\\nThe two solitary promenaders ascended by a steep and winding path to the\\ntop of the gorge, to the spot where the torrent plunges down in a white\\ncolumn of vapor to the foot of the precipice. They found themselves on a\\nsmall platform admirably adapted to their purpose. A number of\\nconvolvuli hanging from the trunks of trees formed a natural cradle\\nsuspended over the waterfall. Sir Ralph, with wonderful self-possession,\\ncut away several branches which might impede their spring, then took his\\ncompanion\\'s hand and drew her to a seat beside him on a moss-covered\\nrock from which in the daytime the beautiful view from that spot could\\nbe seen in all its wild and charming grandeur. But at that moment the\\ndarkness and the dense vapor from the cascade enveloped everything and\\nmade the height of the precipice seem immeasurable and awe-inspiring.\\n\\n\"Let me remind you, my dear Indiana,\" said Ralph, \"that the success of\\nour undertaking requires the greatest self-possession on our part. If\\nyou jump hastily in a direction where, because of the darkness, you see\\nno obstacles, you will inevitably bruise yourself on the rocks and your\\ndeath will be slow and painful; but, if you take care to throw yourself\\nin the direction of the white line which marks the course of the\\nwaterfall you will fall into the lake with it, and the water itself will\\nsee to it that you do not miss your aim. But, if you prefer to wait an\\nhour, the moon will rise high enough to give us light.\"\\n\\n\"I am willing,\" Indiana replied, \"especially as we ought to devote these\\nlast moments to religious thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my dear,\" said Ralph. \"This last hour should be one of\\nmeditation and prayer. I do not say that we ought to make our peace with\\nthe Eternal, that would be to forget the distance that separates us from\\nHis sublime power; but we ought, I think, to make our peace with the men\\nwho have caused our suffering, and to confide to the wind which blows\\ntoward the northeast words of pity for those from whom three thousand\\nleagues of ocean separate us.\"\\n\\nIndiana received this suggestion without surprise or emotion. For\\nseveral months past her thoughts had become more and more elevated in\\ndirect proportion to the change that had taken place in Ralph. She no\\nlonger listened to him simply as a phlegmatic adviser; she followed him\\nin silence as a good spirit whose mission it was to take her from the\\nearth and deliver her from her torments.\\n\\n\"I agree,\" she said; \"I am overjoyed to feel that I can forgive without\\nan effort, that I have neither hatred nor regret nor love nor resentment\\nin my heart; indeed, at this moment, I hardly remember the sorrows of my\\nsad life and the ingratitude of those who surrounded me. Almighty God!\\nThou seest the deepest recesses of my heart; Thou knowest that it is\\npure and calm, and that all my thoughts of love and hope have turned to\\nThee.\"\\n\\nThereupon, Ralph seated himself at Indiana\\'s feet and began to pray in a\\nloud voice that rose above the roar of the cascade. It was the first\\ntime perhaps since he was born that his whole thought came to his lips.\\nThe hour of his death had struck; his heart was no longer held in check\\nby fetters or mysteries; it belonged to God alone; the chains of society\\nno longer weighed it down. Its ardor was no longer a crime, it was free\\nto soar upward to God who awaited it; the veil that concealed so much\\nvirtue, grandeur and power fell away, and the man\\'s mind rose at its\\nfirst leap to the level of his heart.\\n\\nAs a bright flame burns amid dense clouds of smoke and scatters them, so\\ndid the sacred fire that glowed in the depths of his being send forth\\nits brilliant light. The first time that that inflexible conscience\\nfound itself delivered from its trammels and its fears, words came of\\nthemselves to the assistance of his thoughts, and the man of mediocre\\ntalents, who had never said any but commonplace things in his life,\\nbecame, in his last hour, eloquent and convincing as Raymon had never\\nbeen. Do not expect me to repeat to you the strange harangue that he\\nconfided to the echoes of the vast solitude; not even he himself, if he\\nwere here, could repeat it. There are moments of mental exaltation and\\necstasy when our thoughts are purified, subtilized, etherealized as it\\nwere. These infrequent moments raise us so high, carry us so far out of\\nourselves, that when we fall back upon the earth we lose all\\nconsciousness and memory of that intellectual debauch. Who can\\nunderstand the anchorite\\'s mysterious visions? Who can tell the dreams\\nof the poet before his exaltation cooled so that he could write them\\ndown for us? Who can say what marvellous things are revealed to the soul\\nof the just man when Heaven opens to receive him? Ralph, a man so\\nutterly commonplace to all outward appearance--and yet an exceptional\\nman, for he firmly believed in God and consulted the book of his\\nconscience day by day--Ralph at that moment was adjusting his accounts\\nwith eternity. It was the time to be himself, to lay bare his whole\\nmoral being, to lay aside, before the Judge, the disguise that men had\\nforced upon him. Casting away the haircloth in which sorrow had\\nenveloped his bones, he stood forth sublime and radiant as if he had\\nalready entered into the abode of divine rewards.\\n\\nAs she listened to him, it did not occur to Indiana to be surprised; she\\ndid not ask herself if it were really Ralph who talked like that. The\\nRalph she had known had ceased to exist, and he to whom she was\\nlistening now seemed to be a friend whom she had formerly seen in her\\ndreams and who finally became incarnate for her on the brink of the\\ngrave. She felt her own pure soul soar upward in the same flight. A\\nprofound religious sympathy aroused in her the same emotions, and tears\\nof enthusiasm fell from her eyes upon Ralph\\'s hair.\\n\\nThereupon, the moon rose over the tops of the great palms, and its\\nbeams, shining between the branches of the convolvuli, enveloped Indiana\\nin a pale, misty light which made her resemble, in her white dress and\\nwith her long hair falling over her shoulders, the wraith of some maiden\\nlost in the desert.\\n\\nSir Ralph knelt before her and said:\\n\\n\"Now, Indiana, you must forgive me for all the injury I have done you,\\nso that I may forgive myself for it.\"\\n\\n\"Alas!\" she replied, \"what can I possibly have to forgive you, my poor\\nRalph? Ought I not, on the contrary, to bless you to the last moment of\\nmy life, as you have forced me to do in all the days of misery that have\\nfallen to my lot?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know how far I have been blameworthy,\" rejoined Ralph; \"but it\\nis impossible that, in the course of such a long and terrible battle\\nwith my destiny, I should not have been many times without my own\\nvolition.\"\\n\\n\"Of what battle are you speaking?\" queried Indiana.\\n\\n\"That is what I must explain to you before we die; that is the secret of\\nmy life. You asked me to tell it to you on the ship that brought us\\nhere, and I promised to do so on the shore of Bernica Lake, when the\\nmoon should rise upon us for the last time.\"\\n\\n\"That moment has come,\" she said, \"and I am listening.\"\\n\\n\"Summon all your patience then, for I have a long story to tell you,\\nIndiana, and that story is my own.\"\\n\\n\"I thought that I knew it, inasmuch as I have hardly ever been separated\\nfrom you.\"\\n\\n\"You do not know it; you do not know it for a single day, a single\\nhour,\" said Ralph sadly. \"When could I have told it to you, pray? It is\\nHeaven\\'s will that the only suitable moment for me to do so, should be\\nthe last moment of your life and my own. But it is as innocent and\\nproper to-day as it would formerly have been insane and criminal. It is\\na personal gratification for which no one has the right to blame me at\\nthis hour, which you accord to me in order to complete the task of\\npatience and gentleness which you have taken upon yourself with regard\\nto me. Endure to the end, therefore, the burden of my unhappiness; and\\nif my words tire you and annoy you, listen to the waterfall as it sings\\nthe hymn of the dead over me.\\n\\n\"I was born to love; none of you chose to believe it, and your error in\\nthat regard had a decisive influence on my character. It is true that\\nnature, while giving me an ardent heart, was guilty of a strange\\ninconsistency; she placed on my face a stone mask and on my tongue a\\nweight that it could not raise; she refused me what she grants to the\\nmost ordinary mortals, the power to express my feelings by the glance or\\nby speech. That made me selfish. People judged the mental being by the\\nouter envelope and, like an imperfect fruit I was compelled to dry up\\nunder the rough husk which I could not cast off. I was hardly born when\\nI was cast out of the heart which I most needed. My mother put me away\\nfrom her breast with disgust, because my baby face could not return her\\nsmile. At an age when one can hardly distinguish a thought from a\\ndesire, I was already branded with the hateful designation of egotist.\\n\\n\"Thereupon it was decided that no one would love me, because I was\\nunable to put in words my affection for anyone. They made me unhappy,\\nthey declared that I did not feel my unhappiness; I was almost banished\\nfrom my father\\'s house; they sent me to live among the rocks like a\\nlonely shore-bird. You know what my childhood was, Indiana. I passed the\\nlong days in the desert, with no anxious mother to come there in search\\nof me, with no friendly voice amid the silence of the ravines to remind\\nme that the approach of night called me back to the cradle. I grew up\\nalone, I lived alone; but God would not permit me to be unhappy to the\\nend, for I shall not die alone.\\n\\n\"Heaven however sent me a gift, a consolation, a hope. You came into my\\nlife as if Heaven had created you for me. Poor child! abandoned like me,\\nlike me set adrift in life without love and without protectors, you\\nseemed to be destined for me--at least I flattered myself that it was\\nso. Was I too presumptuous? For ten years you were mine, absolutely\\nmine; I had no rivals, no misgivings. At that time I had had no\\nexperience of what jealousy is.\\n\\n\"That time, Indiana, was the least dismal period of my life. I made of\\nyou my sister, my daughter, my companion, my pupil, my whole society.\\nYour need of me made my life something more than that of a wild beast;\\nfor your sake I threw off the gloom into which the contempt of my own\\nfamily had cast me. I began to esteem myself by becoming useful to you.\\nI must tell you everything, Indiana; after accepting the burden of life\\nfor you, my imagination suggested the hope of a reward. I accustomed\\nmyself--forgive the words I am about to use; even to-day I cannot utter\\nthem without fear and trembling--I accustomed myself to think that you\\nwould be my wife; child that you were, I looked upon you as my\\nbetrothed; my imagination arrayed you in the charms of young womanhood;\\nI was impatient to see you in your maturity. My brother, who had usurped\\nmy share of the family affection and who took pleasure in peaceful\\navocations, had a garden on the hillside which we can see from here by\\ndaylight, and which subsequent owners have transformed into a\\nrice-field. The care of his flowers occupied his pleasantest moments,\\nand every morning he went out to watch their progress with an impatient\\neye, and to wonder, child that he was, because they had not grown so\\nmuch as he expected in a single night. You, Indiana, were my whole\\nvocation, my only joy, my only treasure; you were the young plant that I\\ncultivated, the bud that I was impatient to see bloom. I, too, looked\\neagerly every morning for the effect of another day that had passed over\\nyour head; for I was already a young man and you were but a child.\\nAlready passions of which you did not know the name were stirring my\\nbosom; my fifteen years played havoc with my imagination, and you were\\nsurprised to see me so often in a melancholy mood, sharing your games,\\nbut taking no pleasure in them. You could not imagine that a fruit or a\\nbird was no longer a priceless treasure to me as it was to you, and I\\nalready seemed cold and odd to you. And yet you loved me such as I was;\\nfor, despite my melancholy, there was not a moment of my life that was\\nnot devoted to you; my sufferings made you dearer to my heart; I\\ncherished the insane hope that it would be your mission to change them\\nto joys some day.\\n\\n\"Alas! forgive me for the sacrilegious thought which kept me alive for\\nten years; if it were a crime in the accursed child to hope for you,\\nlovely, simple-hearted child of the mountains, God alone is guilty of\\ngiving him, for his only sustenance, that audacious thought. Upon what\\ncould that wounded, misunderstood heart subsist, who encountered new\\nnecessities at every turn and found a refuge nowhere? from whom could he\\nexpect a glance, a smile of love, if not from you, whose lover and\\nfather he was at the same time?\\n\\n\"Do not be shocked to find that you grew up under the wing of a poor\\nbird consumed by love; never did any impure homage, any blameworthy\\nthought endanger the virginity of your soul; never did my mouth brush\\nfrom your cheeks that bloom of innocence which covered them as the fruit\\nis covered with a moist vapor in the morning. My kisses were the kisses\\nof a father, and when your innocent and playful lips met mine they did\\nnot find there the stinging flame of virile desire. No, it was not with\\nyou, a tiny blue-eyed child, that I was in love. As I held you in my\\narms, with your innocent smile and your dainty caresses, you were simply\\nmy child, or at most my little sister; but I was in love with your\\nfifteen years, when, yielding to the ardor of my own youth, I devoured\\nthe future with a greedy eye.\\n\\n\"When I read you the story of Paul and Virginie, you only half\\nunderstood it. You wept, however; you saw only the story of a brother\\nand sister where I had quivered with sympathy, realizing the torments of\\ntwo lovers. That book made me miserable, whereas it was your joy. You\\nenjoyed hearing me read of the attachment of a faithful dog, of the\\nbeauty of the cocoa-palms and the songs of Dominique the negro. But I,\\nwhen I was alone, read over and over the conversations between Paul and\\nhis sweetheart, the impulsive suspicions of the one, the secret\\nsufferings of the other. Oh! how well I understood those first anxieties\\nof youth, seeking in his own heart an explanation of the mysteries of\\nlife, and seizing enthusiastically on the first object of love that\\npresents itself to him! But do me justice, Indiana--I did not commit the\\ncrime of hastening by a single day the placid development of your\\nchildhood; I did not let a word escape me which could suggest to you\\nthat there were such things as tears and misery in life. I left you, at\\nthe age of ten, in all the ignorance, all the security that were yours\\nwhen your nurse placed you in my arms, one day when I had determined to\\ndie.\\n\\n\"Often as I sat alone on this cliff I wrung my hands frantically as I\\nlistened to all the sounds of spring time and of love which the mountain\\ngives forth, as I saw the creepers chase each other to and fro, the\\ninsects sleeping in a voluptuous embrace in the calyx of a flower, as I\\ninhaled the burning dust which the palm-trees sent to one\\nanother--ethereal transports, subtle joys to which the gentle summer\\nbreeze serves as a couch. At such times I was frantic, I was mad. I\\nappealed for love to the flowers, to the birds, to the voice of the\\ntorrent. I called wildly upon that unknown bliss, the mere thought of\\nwhich made my brain whirl. But I would see you running toward me, along\\nyonder path, merry and laughing, so tiny in the distance and so awkward\\nabout climbing the rocks that one might have taken you for a penguin,\\nwith your white dress and your brown hair. Then my blood would grow\\ncalm, my lips cease to burn. In presence of the little Indiana of seven\\nI would forget the Indiana of fifteen of whom I had just been dreaming.\\nI would open my arms to you with pure delight; your kisses would cool my\\nforehead. At those times I was happy; I was a father.\\n\\n\"How many free, peaceful days we have passed in this ravine! How many\\ntimes I have bathed your feet in the pure water of yonder basin! How\\nmany times I have watched you sleeping among the reeds, shaded by the\\nleaf of a palm for an umbrella! It was at those times that my tortures\\nwould occasionally begin anew. It was a sore affliction to me that you\\nwere so small. I would ask myself whether, suffering as I did, I could\\nlive until the day when you could understand me and respond to my love.\\nI would gently lift your silken locks and kiss them with passion. I\\nwould compare them with curls I had cut from your head in preceding\\nyears and which I kept in my wallet. I would joyously make sure of the\\ndarker shade that each recurring spring gave to them. Then I would\\nexamine the marks on the trunk of a date-tree nearby, that I had made to\\nshow the progressive increase in your height for four or five years. The\\ntree still bears those scars, Indiana; I found them on it the last time\\nI came here to suffer. Alas! in vain did you grow taller and taller; in\\nvain did your beauty keep all its promises; in vain did your hair become\\nblack as ebony. You did not grow for me; not for me did your charms\\ndevelop. The first time that your heart beat faster it was for another\\nthan me.\\n\\n\"Do you remember how we ran, as light of foot as two turtle-doves, among\\nthe thickets of wild rose bushes? Do you remember, too, that we\\nsometimes went astray in the forests over our heads? Once we tried to\\nreach the mist-enveloped peaks of the Salazes; but we had not foreseen\\nthat the higher we went the scarcer the fruit became, the less\\naccessible the streams, the more terrible and more penetrating the cold.\\n\\n\"When we saw the vegetation receding behind us you would have returned;\\nbut when we had crossed the fern belt we found a quantity of wild\\nstrawberries, and you were so busy filling your basket with them that\\nyou thought no more about leaving the place. But we had to abandon the\\nidea of going on. We were walking on volcanic rocks covered with little\\nbrown spots, and with woolly plants growing among them. Those wretched\\nwind-beaten weeds made us think of the goodness of God, who has given\\nthem a warm garment to withstand the violence of the storm. Then the\\nmist became so dense that we could not tell where we were going, and we\\nhad to go down again. I carried you in my arms. I crept carefully down\\nthe deep slopes of the mountain. Darkness surprised us as we entered the\\nfirst woods, in the third belt of vegetation. I picked some pomegranates\\nfor you and made shift to quench my own thirst with the convolvuli, the\\nstalks of which contain an abundant supply of cool, pure water.\\nThereupon we recalled the adventure of our favorite heroes, when they\\nlost themselves in the forests of the Rivière-Rouge. But we had no\\nloving mothers, nor zealous servants, nor faithful dog to search for us.\\nBut I was content; I was proud. I shared with no one the duty of\\nwatching over you, and I considered myself more fortunate than Paul.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was a profound and pure and true passion that you inspired in\\nme even then. Noun, at ten years, was a head taller than you; a creole\\nin the fullest acceptation of the word, she was already developed. Her\\nmelting eyes already shone with a curious expression; her bearing and\\ncharacter were those of a young woman. But I did not love Noun, or I\\nloved her only because of you, with whom she always played. It never\\noccurred to me to wonder whether she was beautiful already; whether she\\nwould be more beautiful some day. I never looked at her. In my eyes she\\nwas more of a child than you; for, you see, I loved you. I staked all my\\nhopes upon you; you were the companion of my life, the dream of my\\nyouth.\\n\\n\"Those days of exile in England, that period of pain and grief, I will\\nnot describe. If I treated any one badly, it was not you; and if any one\\ntreated me badly, I do not propose to complain. There I became more\\n_egotistical_ that is to say more depressed and more distrustful than\\never. By being suspicious of me, people had compelled me to become\\nself-sufficient and to rely upon myself. Thus I had only the testimony\\nof my own heart to support me in those trials. It was attributed to me\\nas a crime that I did not love a woman who married me only because she\\nwas forced to and who never treated me with anything but contempt. It\\nwas afterwards remarked that one of the principal characteristics of my\\negotism was the aversion I seemed to feel for children. Raymon more than\\nonce bantered me cruelly concerning that supposed peculiarity, observing\\nthat the care necessary for the education of children was quite\\ninconsistent with the rigidly methodical ways of an old bachelor. I\\nfancy that he did not know that I had been a father, and that it was I\\nwho educated you. But none of you would ever understand that the memory\\nof my son was as intensely painful to me after many years as on the\\nfirst day, and that my sore heart swelled at the sight of flaxen heads\\nthat reminded me of him. When a man is unhappy, people are terribly\\nafraid of not finding him blameworthy enough, because they dread being\\ncompelled to pity him.\\n\\n\"But what no one will ever be able to understand is the profound\\nindignation, the black despair which took possession of me when I, a\\npoor child of the desert, upon whom no one had ever deigned to cast a\\npitying glance, was forced to leave this spot and take upon myself the\\nburdens of society; when I was told that I must fill an empty place that\\nhad spurned me; when they tried to make me understand that I had duties\\nto fulfil toward those men and women who had disregarded their duties\\ntoward me. Think of it! no one of all my kindred had chosen to be my\\nprotector and now they all called upon me to undertake the defence of\\ntheir interests! They would not even leave me to enjoy in peace what\\npariahs enjoy, the air of solitude! I had but one thing in life that I\\ncherished, one thought, one hope--that you would belong to me forever;\\nthey deprived me of that, they told me that you were not rich enough for\\nme. Bitter mockery! for me whom the mountains had nourished and whom my\\nfather\\'s roof had cast out! me, who had never been allowed to learn the\\nuse of riches, and upon whom was now laid the duty of managing to\\nadvantage the riches of other people!\\n\\n\"However I submitted. I had no right to pray that my paltry happiness\\nmight be spared; I was despised enough, Heaven knows! to resist would\\nhave been to make myself odious. My mother, inconsolable for her other\\nson\\'s death, threatened to die herself if I did not follow out my\\ndestiny. My father, who accused me of not knowing how to comfort him, as\\nif I were to blame because he loved me so little, was ready to curse me\\nif I tried to escape from his yoke. I bent my head; but what I suffered\\neven you yourself, although you too have been very unhappy, could never\\nunderstand. If, after being hunted and maltreated and oppressed as I\\nhave been, I have not returned mankind evil for evil, perhaps it is a\\nfair conclusion that my heart is not so cold and sterile as it has been\\naccused of being.\\n\\n\"When I came back here, when I saw the man to whom you had been\\nmarried--forgive me, Indiana, that was the time when I was genuinely\\nselfish; there must always be selfishness in love, since there was a\\ntouch of it even in mine--I felt an indescribably cruel joy in the\\nthought that that legal sham would give you a master and not a husband.\\nYou were surprised at the species of affection for him I displayed; it\\nwas because I did not look upon him as a rival. I knew well enough that\\nthat old man could neither feel nor inspire love, and that your heart\\nwould come forth untouched from that marriage. I was grateful to him for\\nyour coldness and your melancholy. If he had remained here, I should\\nperhaps have become a very guilty man; but you left me alone and it was\\nnot in my power to live without you. I tried to conquer the indomitable\\nlove which had sprung to life again in all its force when I found you as\\nfair and sad as I had dreamed of you in your childhood. But solitude\\nonly intensified my suffering and I yielded to the craving I felt to see\\nyou, to live under the same roof, to breathe the same air, to drink my\\nfill every hour of the melodious tones of your voice. You know what\\nobstacles I had to meet, what distrust I had to overcome; I realized\\nthen what duties I had voluntarily undertaken; I could not connect my\\nlife with yours without quieting your husband\\'s suspicions by a sacred\\npromise, and I have never known what it was to trifle with my word. I\\npledged myself therefore with my mind and my heart never to forget my\\nrôle of brother, and I ask you, Indiana, if I ever was false to my\\noath.\\n\\n\"I realized also that it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for me\\nto perform that painful task, if I laid aside the disguise that\\nprecluded any intimate relations, any profound sentiment; I realized\\nthat I must not play with the danger, for my passion was too intense to\\ncome forth victorious from a battle. I felt that I must erect about\\nmyself a triple wall of ice, in order to repel your interest in me, in\\norder to deprive myself of your compassion, which would have ruined me.\\nI said to myself that on the day that you pitied me, I should be already\\nguilty, and I made up my mind to live under the weight of that horrible\\naccusation of indifference and selfishness, which, thank Heaven! you did\\nnot fail to bring against me. The success of my ruse surpassed my hopes;\\nyou lavished upon me a sort of insulting pity like that which is\\naccorded to eunuchs; you denied me the possession of a heart and\\npassions; you trampled me under foot, and I had not the right to display\\nenergy enough to be angry and vow vengeance, for that would have\\nbetrayed me and shown you that I was a man.\\n\\n\"I complain of mankind at large and not of you, Indiana. You were always\\nkind and merciful; you tolerated me under this despicable disguise I had\\nadopted in order to be near you; you never made me blush for my rôle,\\nyou were all in all to me, and sometimes I thought with pride that if\\nyou looked kindly upon me in the guise I had assumed in order that you\\nmight misunderstand me, you might perhaps love me if you should know me\\nsome day as I really was. Alas! what other than you would not have\\nspurned me? what other would have held out her hand to that speechless,\\nwitless clown? Everybody but you held aloof with disgust from the\\n_egotist!_ Ah! there was one being in the world generous enough not to\\ntire of that profitless exchange; there was one heart large enough to\\nshed something of the blessed flame that animated it upon the narrow,\\nbenumbed heart of the poor abandoned wretch. It required a heart that\\nhad too much of that of which I had not enough. There was under Heaven\\nbut one Indiana capable of caring for a Ralph.\\n\\n\"Next to you the person who showed me the most indulgence was Delmare.\\nYou accused me of preferring him to you, of sacrificing your comfort to\\nmy own by refusing to interfere in your domestic quarrels. Unjust, blind\\nwoman! you did not see that I served you as well as it was possible to\\ndo; and, above all, you did not understand that I could not raise my\\nvoice in your behalf without betraying myself. What would have become of\\nyou if Delmare had turned me out of his house? who would have protected\\nyou, patiently, silently, but with the persevering steadfastness of an\\nundying love? Not Raymon surely. And then I was fond of him from a\\nfeeling of gratitude, I confess;--yes, fond of that rough, vulgar\\ncreature who had it in his power to deprive me of my only remaining joy,\\nand who did not do it; that man whose misfortune it was not to be loved\\nby you, so that there was a secret bond of sympathy between us! I was\\nfond of him too for the very reason that he had never caused me the\\ntortures of jealousy.\\n\\n\"But I have come now to the most ghastly sorrow of my life, to the fatal\\ntime when your love, of which I had dreamed so long, belonged to\\nanother. Then and not till then did I fully realize the nature of the\\nsentiment that I had held in check so many years. Then did hatred pour\\npoison into my breast and jealousy consume what was left of my strength.\\nHitherto my imagination had kept you pure; my respect encompassed you\\nwith a veil which the innocent audacity of dreams dared not even raise;\\nbut when I was assailed by the horrible thought that another had\\ninvolved you in his destiny, had snatched you from my power and was\\nintoxicating himself with deep draughts of the bliss of which I dared\\nnot I even dream, I became frantic; I would have rejoiced to see that\\ndetested man at the foot of this precipice and to roll stones down upon\\nhis head.\\n\\n\"However your sufferings were so great that I forgot my own. I did not\\nchoose to kill him, because you would have wept for him. Indeed I was\\ntempted twenty times, Heaven forgive me! to be a vile and despicable\\nwretch, to betray Delmare and serve my enemy. Yes, Indiana, I was so\\ninsane, so miserable at the sight of your suffering, that I repented\\nhaving tried to enlighten you and that I would have given my life to\\nbequeath my heart to that man! Oh! the villain! may God forgive him for\\nthe injury he has done me! but may He punish him for the misery he has\\nheaped on your head! It is for that that I hate him; for, so far as I am\\nconcerned, I forget what my life has been, when I see what he has made\\nof yours. He is a man whom society should have branded on the forehead\\non the day of his birth! whom it should have spat upon and cast out as\\nthe hardest-hearted and vilest of men! But on the contrary, she bore it\\naloft in triumph. Ah! I recognize mankind in that, and I ought not to be\\nindignant; for man simply obeys his nature in adoring the deformed\\ncreature who destroys the happiness and consideration of another.\\n\\n\"Forgive me, Indiana, forgive me! it is cruel perhaps to complain before\\nyou, but this is the first time and the last; let me curse the\\nungrateful wretch who has driven you to the grave. This terrible lesson\\nwas necessary to open your eyes. In vain did a voice from Noun\\'s\\ndeathbed and Delmare\\'s cry out to you: \\'Beware of him, he will ruin\\nyou!\\'--you were deaf: your evil genius led you on and, dishonored as you\\nare, public opinion condemns you and absolves him. He did all sorts of\\nevil and no heed was paid to it. He killed Noun and you forgot it; he\\nruined you and you forgave him. You see, he had the art to dazzle the\\neyes and deceive the mind; his adroit, deceitful words found their way\\nto the heart; his viper\\'s glance fascinated; and if nature had given him\\nmy metallic features and my dull intelligence she would have made a\\nperfect man of him.\\n\\n\"Yes, I say, may God punish him, for he was barbarous to you! or,\\nrather, may He forgive him, for perhaps he was more stupid than wicked!\\nHe did not understand you; he did not appreciate the happiness he might\\nhave enjoyed! Oh! you loved him so dearly! He might have made your life\\nso beautiful! In his place I would not have been virtuous; I would have\\nfled with you into the heart of the mountains; I would have torn you\\nfrom society to have you all to myself, and I should have had but one\\nfear, that you would not be accursed and abandoned sufficiently so that\\nI might be all in all to you. I would have been jealous of your\\nconsideration, but not in the same way that he was; my aim would have\\nbeen to destroy it in order to replace it by my love. I should have\\nsuffered intensely to see another man give you the slightest morsel of\\npleasure, a moment\\'s gratification; it would have been a theft from me;\\nfor your happiness would have been my care, my property, my life, my\\nhonor! Oh! how vain and how wealthy I would have been with this wild\\nravine for my only home, these mountain trees for my only fortune, if\\nheaven had given them to me with your love! Let us weep, Indiana; it is\\nthe first time in my life that I have wept; it is God\\'s will that I\\nshould not die without knowing that melancholy pleasure.\"\\n\\nRalph was weeping like a child. It was in very truth the first time that\\nstoical soul had ever given way to self-compassion; and yet there was in\\nthose tears more sorrow for Indiana\\'s fate than for his own.\\n\\n\"Do not weep for me,\" he said, seeing that her face too was bathed in\\ntears. \"Do not pity me; your pity wipes out the whole past, and the\\npresent is no longer bitter. Why should I suffer now? You no longer love\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"If I had known you as you are, Ralph, I should never have loved him,\"\\ncried Madame Delmare; \"it was your virtue that was my ruin.\"\\n\\n\"And then,\" continued Ralph, looking at her with a sorrowful smile, \"I\\nhave many other causes of joy. You unwittingly confided something to me\\nduring the hours that we poured out our hearts to each other on board\\nship. You told me that this Raymon was never so fortunate as he had the\\npresumption to claim to be, and you relieved me of a part of my\\ntorments. You took away my remorse for having watched over you so\\nineffectually; for I had the insolence to try to protect you from his\\nfascinations; and therein I insulted you, Indiana. I did not have faith\\nin your strength; that is another crime for you to forgive.\"\\n\\n\"Alas!\" said Indiana, \"you ask me to forgive! me who have made your\\nwhole life miserable, who have rewarded so pure and generous a love with\\nincredible blindness, barbarous ingratitude! Why, I am the one who\\nshould crawl at your feet and implore forgiveness.\"\\n\\n\"Then this love of mine arouses neither disgust nor anger in your\\nbreast, Indiana? O my God! I thank Thee! I shall die happy! Listen,\\nIndiana; cease to blame yourself for my sufferings. At this moment I\\nregret none of Raymon\\'s joys, and I think that my fate would arouse his\\nenvy if he had the heart of a man. Now I am your brother, your husband,\\nyour lover for all eternity. Since the day that you promised to leave\\nthis life with me, I have cherished the sweet thought that you belonged\\nto me, that you had returned to me never to leave me again. I began once\\nmore to call you my betrothed under my breath. It would have been too\\nmuch happiness--or, it may be, not enough--to possess you on earth. In\\nGod\\'s bosom the bliss awaits me of which my childhood dreamed. There,\\nIndiana, you will love me; there, your divine intellect, stripped of all\\nthe lying fictions of this life, will make up to me for a whole life of\\nsacrifices, suffering and self-denial; there, you will be mine, O my\\nIndiana! for you are heaven! and if I deserve to be saved, I deserve to\\npossess you. This is what I had in mind when I asked you to put on this\\nwhite dress; it is the wedding dress; and yonder rock jutting out into\\nthe basin is the altar that awaits us.\"\\n\\nHe rose and plucked a branch from a flowering orange tree in a\\nneighboring thicket and placed it on Indiana\\'s black hair; then he knelt\\nat her feet.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration 06: _RALPH AND INDIANA SEEK DEATH\\nTOGETHER_\\n_Their lips met; and doubtless there is in a love\\nthat comes from the heart a greater power than in\\nthe ardor of a fugitive desire; for that kiss, on the\\nthreshold of another life, summed up for them all\\nthe joys of this._\\n\\n_Thereupon Ralph took his fiancée in his arms and\\nbore her away to plunge with her in the torrent._]\\n\\n\\n\"Make me happy,\" he said; \"tell me that your heart consents to this\\nmarriage in another world. Give me eternity; do not compel me\\nto pray for absolute annihilation.\"\\n\\nIf the story of Ralph\\'s inward life has produced no effect upon you, if\\nyou have not come to love that virtuous man, it is because I have proved\\nto be an unfaithful interpreter of his memories, because I have not been\\nable to exert the power possessed by a man who is profoundly in earnest\\nin his passion. Moreover, the moon does not lend me its melancholy\\ninfluence, nor do the song of the grosbeak, the perfume of the\\ncinnamon-tree, and all the luxurious and intoxicating seductions of a\\nnight in the tropics appeal to your head and heart. It may be, too, that\\nyou do not know by experience what powerful and novel sensations awake\\nin the heart at the thought of suicide, and how all the things of this\\nlife appear in their true light at the moment of severing our connection\\nwith them. This sudden light filled all the inmost recesses of Indiana\\'s\\nheart; the bandage, which had long been loosened, fell from her eyes\\naltogether. Newly awake to the truth and to nature, she saw Ralph\\'s\\nheart as it really was. She also saw his features as she had never seen\\nthem; for the mental exaltation of his position had produced the same\\neffect on him that the Voltaic battery produces on paralyzed limbs; it\\nhad set him free from the paralysis that had fettered his eyes and his\\nvoice. Arrayed in all the glory of his frankness and his virtue he was\\nmuch handsomer than Raymon, and Indiana felt that he was the man she\\nshould have loved.\\n\\n\"Be my husband in heaven and on earth,\" she said, \"and let this kiss\\nbind me to you for all eternity!\"\\n\\nTheir lips met; and doubtless there is in a love that comes from the\\nheart a greater power than in the ardor of a fugitive desire; for that\\nkiss, on the threshold of another life, summed up for them all the joys\\nof this.\\n\\nThereupon Ralph took his fiancée in his arms and bore her away to\\nplunge with her in the torrent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTO J. NERAUD\\n\\n\\nOn a hot, sunshiny day in January last I started from Saint-Paul and\\nwandered into the wild forests of Ile Bourbon to muse and dream. I\\ndreamed of you, my friend; those virgin forests had retained for me the\\nmemory of your wanderings and your studies, the ground had kept the\\nimprint of your feet. I found everywhere the marvellous things with\\nwhich your magical tales charmed the tedium of my vigils in the old\\ndays, and, in order that we might enjoy them together, I called upon old\\nEurope, where obscurity encompasses you with its modest advantages, to\\nsend you to me. Happy man, whose intellect and merits no treacherous\\nfriend has made known to the world!\\n\\nI walked in the direction of a lonely spot in the highest part of the\\nisland, called _Brulé de Saint-Paul._\\n\\nA huge fragment of mountain, which was dislodged and fell during some\\nvolcanic disturbance, has formed on the slope of the principal mountain\\na sort of long arena studded with rocks arranged in the most magical\\ndisorder, in the most extraordinary confusion. Here, a huge boulder\\nbalances itself on a number of small fragments; there, rises a wall of\\nslender, light, porous rocks with dentilated edges and openwork\\ndecoration like a Moorish building; farther on, an obelisk of basalt,\\nwhose sides an artist seems to have carved and polished, stands upon a\\ncrenelated bastion; in another place, a gothic fortress is crumbling to\\ndecay beside a curious, shapeless pagoda. That spot is the rendezvous of\\nall the rough drafts of art, all the sketches of architecture; it would\\nseem that all the geniuses of all nations and of all ages went for their\\ninspiration to that vast work of hazard and demolition. There, doubtless\\nsome magically elaborate design of chance gave birth to the Moorish\\nstyle of sculpture. In the heart of the forests, art found in the\\npalm-tree one of its most beautiful models. The _vacoa_ which anchors\\nitself in the ground and clings to it with a hundred arms branched from\\nits main stalk, evidently furnished the first suggestion of the plan of\\na cathedral supported by its light flying buttresses. In the _Brulé de\\nSaint-Paul_ all shapes, all types of beauty, all humorous and bold\\nconceits were assembled, piled upon one another, arranged and\\nconstructed in one tempestuous night. The spirits of air and fire\\nundoubtedly presided over this diabolical operation; they alone could\\ngive to their productions that awe-inspiring, fanciful, incomplete\\ncharacter which distinguishes their works from those of man; they alone\\ncould have piled up those monstrous boulders, moved those gigantic\\nmasses, toyed with mountains as with grains of sand, and strewn, amid\\ncreations which man has tried to copy, those grand conceptions of art,\\nthose sublime contrasts impossible of realization, which seem to defy\\nthe audacity of the artist and to say to him derisively: \"Try it again.\"\\n\\nI halted at the foot of a crystallized basaltic monument, about sixty\\nfeet high and cut with facets as if by a lapidary. At the top of this\\nstrange object an inscription seemed to have been traced in bold\\ncharacters by an immortal hand. Those vulcanized rocks often present\\nthat phenomenon; long ago, when their substance, softened by the action\\nof fire, was still warm and malleable, they received and retained the\\nimprint of the shells and climbing plants that clung to them. These\\nchance contacts have resulted in some strange freaks, curious\\nhieroglyphics, mysterious characters which seem to have been stamped\\nthere like the seal of some supernatural being, written in cabalistic\\nletters.\\n\\nI stood there a long time, detained by a foolish idea that I might find\\na meaning for those ciphers. This profitless search caused me to fall\\ninto a profound meditation, during which I forgot that time was flying.\\n\\nAlready the mists were gathering about the peaks of the mountains,\\ncreeping down the sides and rapidly shutting out their outlines. Before\\nI had descended half way to the plateau, they reached the belt that I\\nwas crossing and enveloped it in an impenetrable curtain. A moment later\\na high wind came up and swept the mist away in a twinkling. Then it\\nfell; the mist settled down once more, to be once more driven away by a\\nterrific squall.\\n\\nI sought shelter from the storm in a grotto which afforded me some\\nprotection; but another scourge came to the assistance of the wind.\\nTorrents of rain swelled the streams, all of which flow from the summit\\nof the mountain. In an hour, everything was inundated and the sides of\\nthe mountain, with water pouring down on every side, formed one vast\\ncascade which rushed madly down toward the lowlands.\\n\\nAfter two days of most painful and dangerous travelling, I found myself,\\nguided by Providence, I doubt not, at the door of a house built in an\\nexceedingly wild locality. The simple but attractive cottage had\\nwithstood the tempest, being sheltered by a rampart of cliffs which\\nleaned over it as if to act as an umbrella. A little lower, a waterfall\\nplunged madly down into a ravine and formed at the bottom a brimming\\nlake, above which, clumps of lovely trees still reared their\\nstorm-tossed, tired heads.\\n\\nI knocked vigorously; but the face that appeared in the doorway made me\\nrecoil. Before I had opened my mouth to ask for shelter the master of\\nthe house had welcomed me gravely and silently with a wave of his hand.\\nI entered and found myself alone with him, face to face with Sir Ralph\\nBrown.\\n\\nIn the year that had passed since the _Nahandove_ brought Sir Ralph and\\nhis companion back to the colony, he had not been seen in the town three\\ntimes; and, as for Madame Delmare, her seclusion had been so absolute\\nthat her existence was still a problematical matter to many of the\\npeople. It was about the same time that I first landed at Bourbon, and\\nmy present interview with Monsieur Brown was the second one I had had in\\nmy life.\\n\\nThe first had left an ineradicable impression on me; it was at\\nSaint-Paul, on the seashore. His features and bearing had impressed me\\nonly slightly at first; but when, through mere idle curiosity, I\\nquestioned the colonists concerning him, their replies were so strange,\\nso contradictory, that I scrutinized the recluse of Bernica more\\nclosely.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a clown--a man of no education,\" said one; \"an absolute nullity,\\nwho has only one good quality--that of keeping his mouth shut.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s an extremely well educated and profound man,\" said another, \"but\\ntoo strongly persuaded of his own superiority, contemptuous and\\nconceited--so much so that he considers any words wasted that he happens\\nto exchange with the common herd.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a man who cares for nobody but himself,\" said a third; \"a man of\\ninferior capacity, but not stupid; profoundly selfish and, they say,\\nhopelessly unsociable.\"\\n\\n\"Why, don\\'t you know?\" said a young man brought up in the colony and\\nthoroughly imbued with the characteristic narrow-mindedness of\\nprovincials, \"he\\'s a knave, a villain who poisoned his friend in the\\nmost dastardly way in order to marry his wife.\"\\n\\nThis assertion bewildered me so that I turned to another, older\\ncolonist, whom I knew to be possessed of considerable common sense.\\n\\nAs my glance eagerly requested a solution of these enigmas, he answered:\\n\\n\"Sir Ralph was formerly an excellent man, who was not a favorite because\\nhe was not communicative, but whom everybody esteemed. That is all I can\\nsay about him; for, since his unfortunate experience, I have had no\\nrelations with him.\"\\n\\n\"What experience?\" I inquired.\\n\\nHe told me about Colonel Delmare\\'s sudden death, his wife\\'s flight\\nduring the same night, and Monsieur Brown\\'s departure and return. The\\nobscurity which surrounded all these circumstances had been in nowise\\nlessened by the investigations of the authorities; there was no evidence\\nthat the fugitive had committed the crime. The king\\'s attorney had\\nrefused to prosecute; but the partiality of the magistrates for Monsieur\\nBrown was well known, and they had been severely criticised for not\\nhaving at least enlightened public opinion concerning an affair which\\nleft the reputations of two persons marred by a hateful suspicion.\\n\\nA fact that seemed to justify these suspicions was the furtive return of\\nthe two accused persons and their mysterious establishment in the depths\\nof the ravine of Bernica. They had run away at first, so it was said, to\\ngive the affair time to die out; but public opinion had been so cold in\\nFrance that they had been driven to return and take refuge in the\\ndesert, to gratify their criminal attachment in peace.\\n\\nBut all these theories were set at naught by another fact which was\\nvouched for by persons who seemed better informed: Madame Delmare, I was\\ntold, had always manifested a decided coolness, almost downright\\naversion for her cousin Monsieur Brown.\\n\\nI had thereupon scrutinized the hero of so many strange tales\\ncarefully--conscientiously, if I may say so. He was sitting on a bale of\\nmerchandise, awaiting the return of a sailor whom he had sent to make\\nsome purchase or other for him. His eyes, blue as the sea, were gazing\\npensively at the horizon, with such a placid and honest expression; all\\nthe lines of his face were so perfectly in harmony with one another;\\nnerves, muscles, blood, all seemed so tranquil, so perfect, so\\nwell-ordered in that robust and healthy individual, that I would have\\nsworn that all the tales were deadly insults, that he had no crime on\\nhis conscience, that he had never had one in his mind, that his heart\\nand his hands were as pure as his brow.\\n\\nBut suddenly the baronet\\'s distraught glance had fallen upon me, as I\\nwas staring at him with eager and impertinent curiosity. Confused and\\nembarrassed as a thief caught in the act, I lowered my eyes, for Sir\\nRalph\\'s expression conveyed a stern rebuke. Since then I had often\\nthought of him, involuntarily; he had appeared in my dreams. I was\\nconscious, as I thought of him, of that vague feeling of uneasiness,\\nthat indescribable emotion, which are like the magnetic fluid with which\\nan unusual destiny is encompassed.\\n\\nMy desire to know Sir Ralph was very real, therefore, and very keen; but\\nI should have preferred to watch him furtively, without being seen\\nmyself. It seemed to me that I had wronged him. The crystalline\\nappearance of his eyes froze me with terror. It was so evident that he\\nwas a man of towering superiority, either in virtue or in villainy, that\\nI felt very small and mean in his presence.\\n\\nHis hospitality was neither showy nor vulgar. He took me to his room,\\nlent me some clothes and clean linen; then led me to his companion, who\\nwas awaiting us to take supper.\\n\\nAs I saw how young and lovely she still was--she seemed barely\\neighteen--and admired her bloom, her grace, and her sweet voice, I felt\\na thrill of painful emotion. I reflected that that woman was either very\\nguilty or very unfortunate: guilty of a detestable crime or dishonored\\nby a detestable accusation.\\n\\nI was detained at Bernica for a week by the overflowing of the rivers,\\nthe inundation of the plains, the rain and the wind; and then came the\\nsun, and it never occurred to me to leave my hosts.\\n\\nNeither of them could be called brilliant. They had little wit, I should\\nsay--perhaps indeed they had none at all; but they had that quality\\nwhich makes one\\'s words impressive and pleasant to hear; they had\\nintellect of the heart. Indiana is ignorant, but not with that narrow,\\nvulgar ignorance which proceeds from indolence, from carelessness or\\nnullity of character. She is eager to learn what the engrossing\\npreoccupations of her life had prevented her from finding out; and then,\\ntoo, there may have been a little coquetry in the way she questioned Sir\\nRalph, in order to bring into the light her friend\\'s vast stores of\\nknowledge.\\n\\nI found her playful, but without petulance; her manners have retained a\\ntrace of the languor and melancholy natural to creoles, but in her they\\nseemed to me to have a more abiding charm; her eyes especially have an\\nincomparably soft expression and seem to tell the story of a life of\\nsuffering; and when her mouth smiles, there is still a touch of\\nmelancholy in those eyes, but the melancholy that seems to be the\\ncontemplation of happiness or the emotion of gratitude.\\n\\nOne morning I said to them that at last I was going away.\\n\\n\"Already!\" was their answer.\\n\\nThe accent of regret was so genuine, so touching, that I felt\\nencouraged. I had determined that I would not leave Sir Ralph without\\nasking him to tell me his story; but I felt an insurmountable timidity\\nbecause of the horrible suspicion that had been planted in my mind.\\n\\nI tried to overcome it.\\n\\n\"Men are great villains,\" I said to him; \"they have spoken ill of you to\\nme. I am not surprised, now that I know you. Your life must have been a\\nvery beautiful one, to be so slandered----\"\\n\\nI stopped abruptly when I detected an expression of innocent surprise on\\nMadame Delmare\\'s features. I understood that she knew nothing of the\\natrocious calumnies current in the colony, and I encountered upon Sir\\nRalph\\'s face an unequivocal look of haughty displeasure. I rose at once\\nto take my leave of them, shamefaced and sad, crushed by Monsieur\\nBrown\\'s glance, which reminded me of our first meeting and the silent\\ninterview of the same sort we had had on the sea-shore.\\n\\nBitterly chagrined to leave that excellent man in such a frame of mind,\\nregretting that I had annoyed and wounded him in return for the happy\\ndays I owed to him, I felt my heart swell within me and I burst into\\ntears.\\n\\n\"Young man,\" he said, taking my hand, \"remain with us another day; I\\nhave not the courage to let the only friend we have on the island leave\\nus in this way--I understand you,\" he added, after Madame Delmare had\\nleft the room; \"I will tell you my story, but not before Indiana. There\\nare wounds which one must not re-open.\"\\n\\nThat evening we went for a walk in the woods. The trees, which had been\\nso fresh and lovely a fortnight earlier, were entirely stripped of their\\nleaves, but they were already covered with great resinous buds. The\\nbirds and insects had resumed possession of their empire. The withered\\nflowers already had young buds to replace them. The streams\\nperseveringly carried seaward the gravel with which their beds were\\nfilled. Everything was returning to life and health and happiness.\\n\\n\"Just see,\" said Ralph to me, \"with what astounding rapidity this\\nkindly, fecund nature repairs its losses! Does it not seem as if it were\\nashamed of the time wasted, and were determined, by dint of a lavish\\nexpenditure of sap and vigor, to do over in a few days the work of a\\nyear?\"\\n\\n\"And it will succeed,\" rejoined Madame Delmare. \"I remember last year\\'s\\nstorms; at the end of a month there was no trace of them.\"\\n\\n\"It is the image of a heart broken by sorrow,\" I said to her; \"when\\nhappiness comes back, it renews its youth and blooms again very\\nquickly.\"\\n\\nIndiana gave me her hand and looked at Monsieur Brown with an\\nindescribable expression of affection and joy.\\n\\nWhen night fell she went to her room, and Sir Ralph, bidding me sit\\nbeside him on a bench in the garden, told me his history to the point at\\nwhich we dropped it in the last chapter.\\n\\nThere he made a long pause and seemed to have forgotten my presence\\ncompletely.\\n\\nImpelled by my interest in his narrative, I decided to interrupt his\\nmeditation by one last question.\\n\\nHe started like a man suddenly awakened; then, smiling pleasantly, he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"My young friend, there are memories which we rob of their bloom by\\nputting them in words. Let it suffice you to know that I was fully\\ndetermined to kill Indiana with myself. But doubtless the consummation\\nof our sacrifice was still unrecorded in the archives of Heaven. A\\ndoctor would tell you perhaps that a very natural attack of vertigo took\\npossession of my wits and led me astray as to the location of the path.\\nFor my own part, who am not a doctor at all in such matters, I prefer to\\nbelieve that the angel of Abraham and Tobias, that beautiful white angel\\nwith the blue eyes and the girdle of gold, whom you often saw in your\\nchildish dreams, came down from Heaven on a moonbeam, and, as he hovered\\nin the trembling vapor of the cataract, stretched his silvery wings over\\nmy gentle companion\\'s head. The only thing that I am able to tell you is\\nthat the moon sank behind the great peaks of the mountain and no ominous\\nsound disturbed the peaceful murmur of the waterfall; the birds on the\\ncliff did not take their flight until a white streak appeared on the\\nhorizon; and the first ruddy beam that fell upon the clump of\\norange-trees found me on my knees blessing God.\\n\\n\"Do not think, however, that I accepted instantly the unhoped-for\\nhappiness which gave a new turn to my destiny. I was afraid to sound the\\nradiant future that was dawning for me; and when Indiana raised her eyes\\nand smiled upon me, I pointed to the waterfall and talked of dying.\\n\\n\"\\'If you do not regret having lived until this morning,\\' I said to her,\\n\\'we can both declare that we have tasted happiness in all its plenitude;\\nand it is an additional reason for ceasing to live, for perhaps my star\\nwould pale to-morrow. Who can say that, on leaving this spot, on coming\\nforth from this intoxicating situation to which thoughts of death and\\nlove have brought me, I shall not become once more the detestable brute\\nwhom you despised yesterday? Will you not blush for yourself when you\\nfind me again as you have always known me? Oh! Indiana, spare me that\\nhorrible agony; it would be the complement of my destiny.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Do you doubt your heart, Ralph?\\' said Indiana with an adorable\\nexpression of love and confidence, \\'or does not mine offer you\\nsufficient guarantee?\\'\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you? I was not happy at first. I did not doubt Madame\\nDelmare\\'s sincerity, but I was terrified by thought of the future.\\nHaving distrusted myself beyond measure for thirty years, I could not\\nfeel assured in a single day of my ability to please and to retain her\\nlove. I had moments of uncertainty, alarm and bitterness; I sometimes\\nregretted that I had not jumped into the lake when a word from Indiana\\nhad made me so happy.\\n\\n\"She too must have had attacks of melancholy. She found it difficult to\\nbreak herself of the habit of suffering, for the heart becomes used to\\nunhappiness, it takes root in it and cuts loose from it only with an\\neffort. However, I must do her heart the justice to say that she never\\nhad a regret for Raymon; she did not even remember him enough to hate\\nhim.\\n\\n\"At last, as always happens in deep and true attachments, time, instead\\nof weakening our love, established it firmly and sealed it; each day\\ngave it added intensity, because each day brought fresh obligations on\\nboth sides to esteem and to bless. All our fears vanished one by one;\\nand when we saw how easy it was to destroy those causes of distrust, we\\nsmilingly confessed to each other that we took our happiness like\\ncowards and that neither of us deserved it. From that moment we have\\nloved each other in perfect security.\"\\n\\nRalph paused; then, after a few moments of profound meditation in which\\nwe were equally absorbed, he continued, pressing my hand:\\n\\n\"I say nothing of my happiness; if there are griefs that never betray\\ntheir existence and envelop the heart like a shroud, so there are joys\\nthat remain buried in the heart of man because no earthly voice can\\ndescribe them. Moreover, if some angel from heaven should light upon one\\nof these flowering branches and describe those joys in the language of\\nhis native land, you would not understand them, young man, for the\\ntempest has not bruised and shattered you. Alas! what can the heart that\\nhas not suffered understand of happiness? As to our crimes----\" he added\\nwith a smile.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" I cried, my eyes wet with tears.\\n\\n\"Listen, monsieur,\" he continued, interrupting me; \"you have lived but a\\nfew hours with the two outlaws of Bernica, but a single hour would\\nsuffice for you to learn their whole life. All our days resemble one\\nanother; they are all calm and lovely; they pass by as swiftly and as\\npure as those of our childhood. Every night we bless God; we pray to him\\nevery morning, we implore at his hands the sunshine and shade of the day\\nbefore. The greater part of our income is devoted to the redemption of\\npoor and infirm blacks. That is the principal cause of the evil that the\\ncolonists say of us. Would that we were rich enough to set free all\\nthose who live in slavery! Our servants are our friends; they share our\\njoys, we nurse them in sickness. This is the way our life is spent,\\nwithout vexations, without remorse. We rarely speak of the past, rarely\\nof the future; but always of the former without bitterness, of the\\nlatter without alarm. If we sometimes surprise ourselves with tears in\\nour eyes, it is because great joys always cause tears to flow; the eyes\\nare dry in great misery.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" I said after a long silence, \"if the accusations of the\\nworld should reach your ears, your happiness would answer loudly\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"You are young,\" he replied, \"in your eyes, for your conscience is\\ningenuous and pure and unsoiled by the world, our happiness is the proof\\nof our virtue; in the eyes of the world it is our crime. Solitude is\\nsweet, I tell you, and men are not worth a regret.\"\\n\\n\"All do not accuse you,\" I said; \"but even those who appreciate your\\ntrue character blame you for despising public opinion, and those who\\nacknowledge your virtue say that you are arrogant and proud.\"\\n\\n\"Believe me,\" replied Ralph, \"there is more pride in that reproach than\\nin any alleged scorn. As for public opinion, monsieur, judging from\\nthose whom it exalts, ought we not always to hold out our hand to those\\nwhom it tramples upon? It is said that its approval is necessary to\\nhappiness; they who think so should respect it. For my part, I sincerely\\npity any happiness that rises or falls with its capricious breath.\"\\n\\n\"Some moralists criticise your solitary life; they claim that every man\\nbelongs to society, which demands his presence. They add that you set an\\nexample which it is dangerous to follow.\"\\n\\n\"Society should demand nothing of the man who expects nothing from it,\"\\nSir Ralph replied. \"As for the contagion of example, I do not believe in\\nit, monsieur; too much energy is required to break with the world, and\\ntoo much suffering to acquire that energy. So let this unknown happiness\\nflow on in peace, for it costs nobody anything, and conceals itself for\\nfear of making others envious. Go, young man, follow the course of your\\ndestiny; have friends, a profession, a reputation, a fatherland. As for\\nme, I have Indiana. Do not break the chains that bind you to society,\\nrespect its laws if they protect you, accept its judgments if they are\\nfair to you: but if some day it calumniates you and spurns you, have\\npride enough to find a way to do without it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"a pure heart will enable us to endure exile; but, to\\nmake us love it, one must have such a companion as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"if you knew how I pity this world of yours, which looks\\ndown on me!\"\\n\\nThe next day I left Ralph and Indiana; one embraced me, the other shed a\\nfew tears.\\n\\n\"Adieu,\" they said to me; \"return to the world; if some day it banishes\\nyou, remember our Indian cottage.\"']"
